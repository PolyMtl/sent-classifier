 This explains why there are now enormous server farms around the world dedicated to mining Bitcoin

This process is central to Bitcoin’s existence because in the process of mining, all the computers are also serving as accountants for the Bitcoin network

 The algorithm the computers solve requires them to also keep track of all the new transactions coming onto the network

The mining race is meant to be hard so that no one can dominate the accounting and fudge the records

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 In the 2008 paper that first described Bitcoin, the mysterious creator of the virtual currency, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote that the system was designed to thwart a “greedy attacker” who might want to alter the records and “defraud people by stealing back his payments.” Because of the mining and accounting rules, the attacker “ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules.”

The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going

 Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work

But there is disagreement over the real value of Bitcoin and the network that supports it

For people who consider Bitcoin nothing more than a speculative bubble — or a speculative bubble that has enabled online drug sales and ransom payments — any new contribution toward global warming is probably not worth it

But Bitcoin aficionados counter that it has allowed for the creation of the first financial network with no government or company in charge

 In countries like Zimbabwe and Argentina, Bitcoin has sometimes provided a more stable place to park money than the local currency

 And in countries with more stable economies, Bitcoin has led to a flurry of new investments, jobs and start-up companies

“Labeling Bitcoin mining as a ‘waste’ is a failure to look at the big picture,” Marc Bevand, a miner and analyst, wrote on his blog

 The jobs alone, he added, “are a direct, measurable and positive impact that Bitcoin already made on the economy.”

But even some people who are interested in all that innovation have worried about the enormous electrical use

 de Vries, who keeps track of the use on the site Digiconomist, estimated that each Bitcoin transaction currently required 80,000 times more electricity to process than each Visa credit card transaction, for example

 “If you really distrust the financial system, maybe that is unattractive

 But is that difference really worth the additional energy cost? I think for most people that is probably not worth the case.”

The figures published by Mr

 de Vries have been criticized by Mr

 Bevand and other Bitcoin fans, who say they overstate the energy costs by a factor of about three

 Many critics add that producing and securing physical money and gold also require lots of energy, in some cases as much as or more than Bitcoin uses

 Van Valkenburgh, of the Coin Center, has argued that Bitcoin miners, who can do the work anywhere, have an incentive to situate themselves near cheap, often green energy sources, especially now that coal-guzzling China appears to be exiting the mining business

 Buterin for Ethereum, a process that some smaller currencies are already using

 Known as “proof of stake,” it distributes new coins to people who are able to prove their ownership of existing coins — their stake in the system

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 The current method, which relies so heavily on computational power, is called “proof of work.” Under that method, the accounts and people who get new coins don’t need existing tokens

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 They just need lots of computers to take part in the computational race

Energy concerns are not the only factor encouraging the move

 Mr

 Buterin also believes that the new method, which is likely to be rolled out over the next year, will allow for a less centralized network of computers overseeing the system

But it is far from clear that the method will be as secure as the one used by Bitcoin

But many virtual currency aficionados argue that the energy consumption is worth it for the grander cause of securing the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and making a new kind of financial infrastructure, free from the meddling of banks or governments

“The electricity usage is really essential,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a group that advocates for virtual currency technology

 “Because of the costs, we know the only people participating are serious, that they are economically invested

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 That creates the incentives for cooperation.”

This dispute has its foundations in the complex systems that produce tokens like Bitcoin; Ether, the currency on the Ethereum network; and many other new virtual currencies

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU


All of the computers trying to mine tokens are in a computational race, trying to find a particular, somewhat random answer to a math algorithm

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 The algorithm is so complicated that the only way to find the desired answer is to make lots of different guesses

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 The more guesses a computer makes, the better its chances of winning

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 But each time the computers try new guesses, they use computational power and electricity

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU


The lure of new Bitcoins encourages people to use lots of fast computers, and lots of electricity, to find the right answer and unlock the new Bitcoins that are distributed every 10 minutes or so

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU


This process was defined by the original Bitcoin software, released in 2009

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 The goal was to distribute new coins to people on the Bitcoin network without a central institution handing out the money

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU


Early on, it was possible to win the contest with just a laptop computer

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 But the rules of the network dictate that as more computers join in the race, the algorithm automatically adjusts to get harder, requiring anyone who wants to compete to use more computers and more electricity

These days, the 12.5 Bitcoins that are handed out every 10 minutes or so are worth about $145,000, so people have been willing to invest astronomical sums to participate in this race, which has in turn made the race harder

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 This explains why there are now enormous server farms around the world dedicated to mining Bitcoin

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU


This process is central to Bitcoin’s existence because in the process of mining, all the computers are also serving as accountants for the Bitcoin network

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 The algorithm the computers solve requires them to also keep track of all the new transactions coming onto the network

The mining race is meant to be hard so that no one can dominate the accounting and fudge the records

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 In the 2008 paper that first described Bitcoin, the mysterious creator of the virtual currency, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote that the system was designed to thwart a “greedy attacker” who might want to alter the records and “defraud people by stealing back his payments.” Because of the mining and accounting rules, the attacker “ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules.”

The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU


But there is disagreement over the real value of Bitcoin and the network that supports it

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N


For people who consider Bitcoin nothing more than a speculative bubble — or a speculative bubble that has enabled online drug sales and ransom payments — any new contribution toward global warming is probably not worth it

 In countries like Zimbabwe and Argentina, Bitcoin has sometimes provided a more stable place to park money than the local currency

“Labeling Bitcoin mining as a ‘waste’ is a failure to look at the big picture,” Marc Bevand, a miner and analyst, wrote on his blog

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 The jobs alone, he added, “are a direct, measurable and positive impact that Bitcoin already made on the economy.”

But even some people who are interested in all that innovation have worried about the enormous electrical use

 “If you really distrust the financial system, maybe that is unattractive

 But is that difference really worth the additional energy cost? I think for most people that is probably not worth the case.”

The figures published by Mr

 de Vries have been criticized by Mr

Perhaps the biggest change could come from the new mining process proposed by Mr

 Buterin for Ethereum, a process that some smaller currencies are already using

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 Known as “proof of stake,” it distributes new coins to people who are able to prove their ownership of existing coins — their stake in the system

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 The current method, which relies so heavily on computational power, is called “proof of work.” Under that method, the accounts and people who get new coins don’t need existing tokens

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 They just need lots of computers to take part in the computational race

Energy concerns are not the only factor encouraging the move

 Mr

 Buterin also believes that the new method, which is likely to be rolled out over the next year, will allow for a less centralized network of computers overseeing the system

There Is Nothing Virtual About Bitcoin’s Energy Appetite Image An employee at a Bitmain facility in Inner Mongolia, one of the biggest Bitcoin farms in the world

SAN FRANCISCO — Creating a new Bitcoin requires electricity

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 A lot of it

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


In the virtual currency world this creation process is called “mining.” There is no physical digging, since Bitcoins are purely digital

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 But the computer power needed to create each digital token consumes at least as much electricity as the average American household burns through in two years, according to figures from Morgan Stanley and Alex de Vries, an economist who tracks energy use in the industry

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


The total network of computers plugged into the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy each day as some medium-size countries — which country depends on whose estimates you believe

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 And the network supporting Ethereum, the second-most valuable virtual currency, gobbles up another country’s worth of electricity each day

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


The energy consumption of these systems has risen as the prices of virtual currencies have skyrocketed, leading to a vigorous debate among Bitcoin and Ethereum enthusiasts about burning so much electricity

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N


The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is leading an experiment with a more energy-efficient way to create tokens, in part because of his concern about the impact that the network’s electricity use could have on global warming

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


“I would personally feel very unhappy if my main contribution to the world was adding Cyprus’s worth of electricity consumption to global warming,” Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N
 Buterin said in an interview

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


But many virtual currency aficionados argue that the energy consumption is worth it for the grander cause of securing the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and making a new kind of financial infrastructure, free from the meddling of banks or governments

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


“The electricity usage is really essential,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a group that advocates for virtual currency technology

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 “Because of the costs, we know the only people participating are serious, that they are economically invested

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 That creates the incentives for cooperation.”

This dispute has its foundations in the complex systems that produce tokens like Bitcoin; Ether, the currency on the Ethereum network; and many other new virtual currencies

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


All of the computers trying to mine tokens are in a computational race, trying to find a particular, somewhat random answer to a math algorithm

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 The algorithm is so complicated that the only way to find the desired answer is to make lots of different guesses

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 The more guesses a computer makes, the better its chances of winning

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 But each time the computers try new guesses, they use computational power and electricity

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


The lure of new Bitcoins encourages people to use lots of fast computers, and lots of electricity, to find the right answer and unlock the new Bitcoins that are distributed every 10 minutes or so

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


This process was defined by the original Bitcoin software, released in 2009

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 The goal was to distribute new coins to people on the Bitcoin network without a central institution handing out the money

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


Early on, it was possible to win the contest with just a laptop computer

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 But the rules of the network dictate that as more computers join in the race, the algorithm automatically adjusts to get harder, requiring anyone who wants to compete to use more computers and more electricity

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


These days, the 12.5 Bitcoins that are handed out every 10 minutes or so are worth about $145,000, so people have been willing to invest astronomical sums to participate in this race, which has in turn made the race harder

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 This explains why there are now enormous server farms around the world dedicated to mining Bitcoin

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


This process is central to Bitcoin’s existence because in the process of mining, all the computers are also serving as accountants for the Bitcoin network

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 The algorithm the computers solve requires them to also keep track of all the new transactions coming onto the network

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x

The mining race is meant to be hard so that no one can dominate the accounting and fudge the records

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 In the 2008 paper that first described Bitcoin, the mysterious creator of the virtual currency, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote that the system was designed to thwart a “greedy attacker” who might want to alter the records and “defraud people by stealing back his payments.” Because of the mining and accounting rules, the attacker “ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules.”

The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


But there is disagreement over the real value of Bitcoin and the network that supports it

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N


For people who consider Bitcoin nothing more than a speculative bubble — or a speculative bubble that has enabled online drug sales and ransom payments — any new contribution toward global warming is probably not worth it

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N


But Bitcoin aficionados counter that it has allowed for the creation of the first financial network with no government or company in charge

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 In countries like Zimbabwe and Argentina, Bitcoin has sometimes provided a more stable place to park money than the local currency

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) P
 And in countries with more stable economies, Bitcoin has led to a flurry of new investments, jobs and start-up companies

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) P


“Labeling Bitcoin mining as a ‘waste’ is a failure to look at the big picture,” Marc Bevand, a miner and analyst, wrote on his blog

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 The jobs alone, he added, “are a direct, measurable and positive impact that Bitcoin already made on the economy.”

But even some people who are interested in all that innovation have worried about the enormous electrical use

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N


Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 de Vries, who keeps track of the use on the site Digiconomist, estimated that each Bitcoin transaction currently required 80,000 times more electricity to process than each Visa credit card transaction, for example

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


“Visa is more centralized,” Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 de Vries said

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 “If you really distrust the financial system, maybe that is unattractive

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N
 But is that difference really worth the additional energy cost? I think for most people that is probably not worth the case.”

The figures published by Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 de Vries have been criticized by Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N
 Bevand and other Bitcoin fans, who say they overstate the energy costs by a factor of about three

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N
 Many critics add that producing and securing physical money and gold also require lots of energy, in some cases as much as or more than Bitcoin uses

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Van Valkenburgh, of the Coin Center, has argued that Bitcoin miners, who can do the work anywhere, have an incentive to situate themselves near cheap, often green energy sources, especially now that coal-guzzling China appears to be exiting the mining business

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Several mining companies have opened server farms near geothermal energy in Iceland and hydroelectric power in Washington State

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


But the concerns about electricity use have still hit home with many in the industry

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 The virtual currencies known as Ripple and Stellar, which were created after Bitcoin, were designed not to require electrically demanding mining

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


Perhaps the biggest change could come from the new mining process proposed by Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Buterin for Ethereum, a process that some smaller currencies are already using

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Known as “proof of stake,” it distributes new coins to people who are able to prove their ownership of existing coins — their stake in the system

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 The current method, which relies so heavily on computational power, is called “proof of work.” Under that method, the accounts and people who get new coins don’t need existing tokens

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 They just need lots of computers to take part in the computational race

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


Energy concerns are not the only factor encouraging the move

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Buterin also believes that the new method, which is likely to be rolled out over the next year, will allow for a less centralized network of computers overseeing the system

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


But it is far from clear that the method will be as secure as the one used by Bitcoin

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Buterin has been fiercely attacked by Bitcoin advocates, who say his proposal will lose the qualities that make virtual currencies valuable

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N


Mr

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 Van Valkenburgh said that for now, throwing lots of computing power into the mix — and the electricity that it burns — was the only proven solution to the problems Bitcoin solves

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


“At the moment, if you want robust security, you need proof of work,” he said

Malformed input for sentence:  The algorithm is so complicated that the only way to find the desired answer is to make lots of different guesses
Malformed input for sentence:  The more guesses a computer makes, the better its chances of winning
Malformed input for sentence:  But each time the computers try new guesses, they use computational power and electricity
Malformed input for sentence: 

The lure of new Bitcoins encourages people to use lots of fast computers, and lots of electricity, to find the right answer and unlock the new Bitcoins that are distributed every 10 minutes or so
Malformed input for sentence: 

This process was defined by the original Bitcoin software, released in 2009
Malformed input for sentence:  The goal was to distribute new coins to people on the Bitcoin network without a central institution handing out the money
Malformed input for sentence: 

Early on, it was possible to win the contest with just a laptop computer
Malformed input for sentence:  But the rules of the network dictate that as more computers join in the race, the algorithm automatically adjusts to get harder, requiring anyone who wants to compete to use more computers and more electricity
Malformed input for sentence: 

These days, the 12.5 Bitcoins that are handed out every 10 minutes or so are worth about $145,000, so people have been willing to invest astronomical sums to participate in this race, which has in turn made the race harder
Malformed input for sentence:  This explains why there are now enormous server farms around the world dedicated to mining Bitcoin
Malformed input for sentence: 

This process is central to Bitcoin’s existence because in the process of mining, all the computers are also serving as accountants for the Bitcoin network
Malformed input for sentence:  The algorithm the computers solve requires them to also keep track of all the new transactions coming onto the network

The mining race is meant to be hard so that no one can dominate the accounting and fudge the records
Malformed input for sentence:  In the 2008 paper that first described Bitcoin, the mysterious creator of the virtual currency, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote that the system was designed to thwart a “greedy attacker” who might want to alter the records and “defraud people by stealing back his payments.” Because of the mining and accounting rules, the attacker “ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules.”

The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going
Malformed input for sentence:  Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work
Malformed input for sentence: 

But Bitcoin aficionados counter that it has allowed for the creation of the first financial network with no government or company in charge
Malformed input for sentence: 

“Labeling Bitcoin mining as a ‘waste’ is a failure to look at the big picture,” Marc Bevand, a miner and analyst, wrote on his blog
Malformed input for sentence: 

Mr
Malformed input for sentence:  de Vries, who keeps track of the use on the site Digiconomist, estimated that each Bitcoin transaction currently required 80,000 times more electricity to process than each Visa credit card transaction, for example
Malformed input for sentence: 

“Visa is more centralized,” Mr
Malformed input for sentence:  de Vries said
Malformed input for sentence:  But is that difference really worth the additional energy cost? I think for most people that is probably not worth the case.”

The figures published by Mr
Malformed input for sentence:  Many critics add that producing and securing physical money and gold also require lots of energy, in some cases as much as or more than Bitcoin uses
Malformed input for sentence: 

Mr
Malformed input for sentence:  Van Valkenburgh, of the Coin Center, has argued that Bitcoin miners, who can do the work anywhere, have an incentive to situate themselves near cheap, often green energy sources, especially now that coal-guzzling China appears to be exiting the mining business
Malformed input for sentence:  Several mining companies have opened server farms near geothermal energy in Iceland and hydroelectric power in Washington State
Malformed input for sentence: 

But the concerns about electricity use have still hit home with many in the industry
Malformed input for sentence:  The virtual currencies known as Ripple and Stellar, which were created after Bitcoin, were designed not to require electrically demanding mining
Malformed input for sentence: 

Perhaps the biggest change could come from the new mining process proposed by Mr
Malformed input for sentence:  Buterin for Ethereum, a process that some smaller currencies are already using
Malformed input for sentence:  Known as “proof of stake,” it distributes new coins to people who are able to prove their ownership of existing coins — their stake in the system
Malformed input for sentence:  The current method, which relies so heavily on computational power, is called “proof of work.” Under that method, the accounts and people who get new coins don’t need existing tokens
Malformed input for sentence:  They just need lots of computers to take part in the computational race
Malformed input for sentence: 

Energy concerns are not the only factor encouraging the move
Malformed input for sentence:  Mr
Malformed input for sentence:  Buterin also believes that the new method, which is likely to be rolled out over the next year, will allow for a less centralized network of computers overseeing the system
Malformed input for sentence: 

But it is far from clear that the method will be as secure as the one used by Bitcoin
Malformed input for sentence:  Mr
Malformed input for sentence: 

Mr
Malformed input for sentence:  Van Valkenburgh said that for now, throwing lots of computing power into the mix — and the electricity that it burns — was the only proven solution to the problems Bitcoin solves
Malformed input for sentence: 

“At the moment, if you want robust security, you need proof of work,” he said
