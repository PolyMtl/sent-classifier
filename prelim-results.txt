This dispute has its foundations in the complex systems that produce tokens like Bitcoin; Ether, the currency on the Ethereum network; and many other new virtual currencies

All of the computers trying to mine tokens are in a computational race, trying to find a particular, somewhat random answer to a math algorithm

 But each time the computers try new guesses, they use computational power and electricity

The lure of new Bitcoins encourages people to use lots of fast computers, and lots of electricity, to find the right answer and unlock the new Bitcoins that are distributed every 10 minutes or so

This process was defined by the original Bitcoin software, released in 2009

 The goal was to distribute new coins to people on the Bitcoin network without a central institution handing out the money

Early on, it was possible to win the contest with just a laptop computer

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU

The mining race is meant to be hard so that no one can dominate the accounting and fudge the records

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 In the 2008 paper that first described Bitcoin, the mysterious creator of the virtual currency, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote that the system was designed to thwart a “greedy attacker” who might want to alter the records and “defraud people by stealing back his payments.” Because of the mining and accounting rules, the attacker “ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules.”

The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) NEU
 Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work

SAN FRANCISCO — Creating a new Bitcoin requires electricity

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x

In the virtual currency world this creation process is called “mining.” There is no physical digging, since Bitcoins are purely digital

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x
 But the computer power needed to create each digital token consumes at least as much electricity as the average American household burns through in two years, according to figures from Morgan Stanley and Alex de Vries, an economist who tracks energy use in the industry

The total network of computers plugged into the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy each day as some medium-size countries — which country depends on whose estimates you believe

 And the network supporting Ethereum, the second-most valuable virtual currency, gobbles up another country’s worth of electricity each day

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) x


The energy consumption of these systems has risen as the prices of virtual currencies have skyrocketed, leading to a vigorous debate among Bitcoin and Ethereum enthusiasts about burning so much electricity

What sentiment does this sentence possess? (P|N|NEU|X) N

BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.

To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.

In October, it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg.

Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m.
