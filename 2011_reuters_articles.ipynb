      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and leaders in the U.S. Congress are racing against a midnight Friday deadline to reach a deal on government spending for the rest of this fiscal year, which ends on September 30. \n",
      "\n",
      " With only a few hours remaining, here are some scenarios on what could happen: A DEAL IS REACHED Obama, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, agree on spending reductions. They've been discussing cuts that would total around $38 billion for the remainder of the fiscal year. Negotiations have been complicated by House Republicans insisting on some controversial policy changes, such as restrictions on funding for family planning and the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate air pollution. Once a deal is reached, Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate would then have to make sure enough of their rank-and-file members will support it. If so, a bill will be drawn up and sent to the two chambers for a vote. TIMING FOR CONGRESS TO APPROVE DEAL Once a deal is set, it would take several days to write a bill, post it publicly and then vote on it so that President Barack Obama can sign it into law. A DEAL AND STOPGAP FUNDING If there is a deal, Congress would move quickly to pass a stopgap spending bill to keep the government running past midnight Friday and until the deal is enacted into law. That action could come either late Friday or sometime on Saturday. House members have been notified they need to be available for votes in a rare Saturday session. House Republicans already have passed a spending bill keeping the government open beyond Friday. But with $12 billion in spending cuts over the life of the one-week plan, Obama says he'll veto it. Democrats are pushing for a stopgap bill with no policy restrictions or spending cuts. FAILURE AND STOPGAP FUNDING If a deal cannot be reached, the federal government would partially shut down on Saturday. Hundreds of thousands of government workers across the United States would be identified as either essential or nonessential. Nonessential workers would be furloughed while essential employees will continue working. Some government services would be unaffected by the shutdown, including the military, border patrol, air traffic controllers and federal criminal investigators. Fifteen years ago, when the last shutdown occurred, the government was partially closed for a record 21 days. Government employees were reimbursed for their lost wages. The government shutdown would continue until negotiators either strike a deal or Congress decides to pass a temporary spending bill. (Editing by  Deborah Charles )\n",

      " GODOLLA, Hungary  (Reuters) - Euro zone ministers said Portugal must make deeper budget cuts and privatize state firms in return for an 80 billion euro bailout the bloc wants to finalize by mid-May, just weeks before an election and state funding crunch. \n",
      "\n",
      " Portugal bowed to pressure from financial markets and its European partners this week and became the third euro zone country after Greece and Ireland to request financial help from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Finance ministers from the 17-nation single currency area met at a palace north of Budapest on Friday to discuss the details and timeline of a rescue, which has been complicated by political turmoil in the Iberian nation of 10.5 million. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned abruptly last month after parliament rejected a new round of budget austerity his minority Socialist government had proposed to help the country meet its deficit reduction targets. He is continuing to serve in a caretaker capacity until new elections are held on June 5. The main opposition party has backed his request for aid, but negotiations on an economic adjustment program -- a precondition for assistance -- are likely to be tough as cross-party consensus will be needed. \"The preparations will start immediately to reach a cross-party agreement ensuring that an adjustment program can be adopted by mid-May and implemented swiftly after the formation of a new government,\" European finance ministers said in a statement. They said the program would be based on three pillars: an \"ambitious\" fiscal adjustment to restore financial sustainability; growth and competitiveness enhancing reforms including a far-reaching privatization program; and measures to maintain the liquidity and solvency of the financial sector. Inflexible labor laws, red tape in business administration and high wages and production costs compared to Eastern Europe and East Asia have undermined Portugal's competitiveness. The country has posted meager growth, with an average annual expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) of less than 1 percent over the past decade, according to data from the IMF and the World Bank. RISKS FOR SPAIN Officials did their best to play down concerns that the contagion that has spread across the bloc's southern periphery could now hit Portugal's larger neighbor Spain, which has scrambled to reform its labor market, pension system and savings banks this year to avoid a similar fate. For now markets appear to be confident Spain can avoid becoming the fourth euro zone domino to fall. The spreads between Spanish bond yields and those of German benchmarks -- a key measure of investor confidence in Spain's finances -- were hovering below 1.8 percent on Friday, their lowest levels in five months. Spain's benchmark stock index has climbed 6 percent in the past three weeks. And in a sign of broader confidence in the euro zone, the single currency pushed up to a 15-month high against the dollar on Friday after the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points -- the first hike since July 2008. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who also attended the meeting in Hungary, declined to comment on the euro's strength, which along with higher rates could undermine the economies of weak euro zone countries struggling under huge debt piles. Because of these risks, investors are continuing to scrutinize Spain, which has a host of weaknesses -- from high unemployment and weak growth to a troubled banking sector hit by the bursting of a property bubble. \"It has been clear for a long time that the current stage of the crisis is a severe combination of sovereign debt and banking sector fragilities and you cannot solve one without solving the other,\" said European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn at the end of the meeting. \"The next round of bank stress tests is decisive,\" he said, referring to tests being run on 90 European banks to gauge their ability to withstand financial shocks. The results will be published in June. \"STARTING POINT\" Ministers said the measures rejected by the Portuguese parliament last month would be a \"starting point\" for talks on a fiscal adjustment program. Rehn told reporters that European officials were confident Lisbon could manage the country's funding needs this month and next, but that June, when some 4.9 billion euros in bond redemptions are due, would be \"more challenging.\" Officials said it would take 10 days to ensure financing once the bailout deal was in place, most likely by a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on May 16. The European Commission estimates Lisbon will require about 80 billion euros in aid, roughly the same amount as Ireland but less than the 110 billion euro package offered to Greece nearly one year ago. Two thirds of the total would come from European countries and the remaining third from the IMF. Ministers also discussed Greece, reminding Athens of the importance of sticking to its public deficit targets amid reports it could fall short for 2010. Speculation has grown in recent weeks that Athens may have to restructure a debt load that will to peak at over 150 percent of GDP, with senior government officials in the euro zone conceding in private that such a step may be inevitable. But the Greek government and leaders of other euro members have rejected that talk.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - \"Let me be crystal clear,\" Barclays' star investment banker and new Chief Executive Bob Diamond told members of the British parliament in January. \"We are going to be here in the United Kingdom, and this is the place that we want to succeed.\" \n",
      "\n",
      " It may be a reflection of how bankers still struggle to be taken at their word in the wake of the global financial crisis, but Diamond's statement convinced nobody. Rumors that Barclays and its bigger rival HSBC are ready to move their headquarters to Hong Kong or New York have flourished ever since. Speculation has intensified in the run-up to the April 11 publication of an interim report into the future of British financial services by the Independent Commission on Banking (ICB). The banks fear it will recommend costly reforms. A public admission by Diamond last week that he had \"an obligation on behalf of shareholders\" to look at alternative tax bases, and repeated warnings from senior city figures about the consequences of a high-profile defection, are seen as thinly veiled attempts to influence the commission's thinking. But research by Reuters shows the commission should be in a strong position to counter such threats, since the impact of any big bank departures on the economy, government finances and the City of London's pre-eminence as a financial center would be extremely limited. In a crucial year for global finance, as the regulatory landscape is substantially redrawn, this may embolden the committee. That in turn would help the Conservative-led UK government strike the balance it needs between sounding tough on an industry whose excesses anger the public, and appeasing some of the Conservatives' top donors. In any case, the banks' threats to quit the UK may prove overblown, says Andrea Leadsom, a Conservative member of parliament's influential Treasury Select Committee: \"I think it's unlikely -- I'd say no better than evens -- that any one bank will move offshore, and if they do move what that means for tax take will depend on the bank involved but is likely to be fairly limited.\" Leadsom, a former senior executive at Barclays and one of those who grilled American-born Diamond during January's testimony, says senior bankers often tell her the government is on the verge of driving them away, but she is not impressed. \"I'm not an advocate of ever tighter regulation,\" she told Reuters. \"What we need is clever regulation. But I don't think it's as simple as saying 'if you keep annoying us we'll just leave'. I think that's a nonsense argument.\" And even if some do leave, asks Leadsom, so what? \"One or two of them might change their corporate headquarters for tax purposes but if they do go we probably won't even notice. There won't be a great outflow of workers and Canary Wharf won't turn into a ghost town.\" Some supporters of reform, including a few within the Bank of England, go further, suggesting that the banks' departure might even be desirable given HSBC's $2.5 trillion balance sheet alone is bigger than the entire British economy. Even though HSBC has come through the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, that puts the bank firmly in the \"too big to fail\" bracket -- in a crisis, it would have to be bailed out, which may encourage risk-taking. TAX HAVEN BRITAIN? Banks have long been huge wealth generators for Britain. Most of that, though, comes from the dividends banks dole out, the jobs they create and the income tax their staff pay -- and not from corporation tax. That undercuts bank complaints about government treatment. When Oswald Gruebel, chief executive of Swiss bank UBS, launched a broadside against the British government last month, accusing it of neglecting the banks, he noted that his bank alone employed some 7,000 people in London. \"The government is so quiet about (the City),\" Gruebel told the Financial Times. \"Only behind closed doors do they pay lip service to wanting to keep the City. If it is abandoned by the government one day, God help you.\" But UBS' annual report for 2010 shows how tax advantages in London mean it and other banks that have made huge losses have a vested interest in staying in the UK where -- unlike the United States and Switzerland -- they can offset losses against tax indefinitely. Swiss tax losses can generally be carried forward for seven years, U.S. federal tax losses for 20 years, but in the UK or Jersey, there is no time limit. The English language version of UBS's annual report shows in some detail how it hopes to be able to offset up to 51 billion Swiss francs ($56 billion) in accrued losses against tax globally in the coming years. While it does not specify how much of these the British taxpayer can expect to absorb, the tables do reveal that some 11 billion Swiss francs worth fall into the \"no-expiry\" bracket offered by the UK. A further 37 billion francs are due to expire in the next 11 to 20 years -- beyond typical Swiss limits but in line with U.S. allowances. The ability to offset historical losses is incredibly helpful to any company. Any corporation tax paid by UBS last year was more than offset by past losses, meaning that across the group it recorded a net income tax gain of 381 million Swiss francs. Unusually, it also posted a bigger net profit than its operating pretax profit. On this scale, the offset starts to make a new levy on banks by the UK government -- which has raised heckles in the city and which UBS has said will cost it 75-100 million Swiss Francs a year -- look like small change. Asked whether UBS had paid any corporation tax in the UK in 2010 or expected to do so in the coming years, a spokesman for the bank said it did not disclose information on tax paid in specific countries. At the same time, the UK government is making it more attractive to be based in London by cutting corporation tax to 26 percent from 28 percent and planning a further fall to 23 percent by 2014, which would be the lowest rate in the G7. It has also moved to allay fears -- a legacy of the previous government -- that companies' overseas earnings may lose tax-exempt status. \"The lower corporation tax rate in the UK and the move to exemption (on foreign income) should increase the desirability of the UK as a base,\" says Helen Miller, Senior Research Economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \"The U.S. has a higher statutory rate of corporation tax and it taxes global earnings, which sounds on the face of it less attractive, although there are many other reasons why companies might choose to base themselves in the United States.\" The United States manages to retain a competitive edge, for instance, because firms can avoid some tax on worldwide income by not sending it home. THE CORPORATION OR ITS EMPLOYEES? The sheer complexity of the global tax system is another disincentive to making a big move, a fact the ICB will consider in its recommendations. Another important factor: how little the banks currently contribute directly to the exchequer in relative terms, and how little that is likely to change as a result of any defections. HSBC, which unlike rivals publishes detailed breakdowns of its tax bill including actual figures, says it paid $750 million in corporation tax in the UK last year -- much more than many of its rivals but still a fraction of its $6 billion dividend payment. To put that in perspective, it equates to 0.08 percent of the British government's total estimated receipts for the coming year or 13 percent of the total tax paid by the bank globally last year. HSBC's best-paid 280 staff alone received about $472 million in cash and shares for 2010. More importantly though, HSBC will continue to pay corporation tax on its UK operations no matter where it is based. Hong Kong may not boast HSBC's headquarters but it collected $962 million in tax on profits from the bank last year -- almost 30 percent more than HSBC paid to the UK in corporate tax. None of which is to argue that the banking system is not important to the British economy. The British Bankers' Association estimates its members contribute about 50 billion pounds a year to the UK economy, while Barclays boasted in its 2010 annual report that the banking sector employs nearly 500,000 people in Britain. In terms of taxes alone, Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and former banker James Sassoon told members of the House of Lords in February that large banking groups were expected to contribute around 20 billion pounds ($30 billion) in tax for the 2010-11 tax year. Crucially, though, that figure includes indirect contributions such as income tax paid by bank employees. Of his 20 billion pound tax-take figure, Sassoon says the proportion contributed by pay-as-you-earn income tax and other social contributions is 80 percent, with corporation tax making up the remaining 20 percent. Then there's the argument that no one financial institution is, or should be, indispensable in a country where the Financial Services Authority regulates some 29,000 companies, which between them employ over a million people. \"When you see figures about how much the City contributes in tax, they lump the banks in with lots of other firms. Banks are only a small component of that, so when you talk about the banks leaving, there's not going to be this enormous outflow of revenues,\" says Lydia Prieg, a researcher at the left-leaning New Economics Foundation think tank who previously worked on the trading floor at Goldman Sachs. Even if a bank leaves, it is unlikely to take all its staff with it. HSBC employs more people in the UK than it does in any other single market -- almost as many as in Hong Kong and the United States combined. A lot of those jobs are likely to stay no matter where the bank is based. That was certainly the experience of the world's biggest advertising agency WPP when it shifted its tax base to a Georgian townhouse in a street just off Dublin's St Stephen's Green in 2008. Out of a global workforce of 138,000, WPP only ever moved a handful of people to Ireland before deciding last month -- prompted by the latest tax changes -- to move back to London. There's also the issue of shareholders. Four of the top five biggest shareholders in HSBC, for instance, are venerable British asset managers. Indeed, about 40 percent of the $6 billion in dividends that the bank is due to pay for 2010 will go to UK pension funds and shareholders. Combined, the top eight shareholders alone will make more in the dividend payout than the UK taxman gets in corporation tax. Those dividends will keep rolling in wherever HSBC is based. It's a similar story with other banks. Barclays declined to provide details of how much corporation tax it paid in Britain in 2010 but its annual report shows it had a worldwide tax charge of 1.5 billion pounds, which equates to less than 13 percent of its 12 billion pounds in staff costs, most of which are salaries and pension or social security contributions. In February, in response to questions from parliament's Treasury Select Committee, the bank revealed that it paid 113 million pounds in corporation tax to the UK in 2009 -- 1 percent of its global pre-tax profit that year, and less than a quarter of the 504 million pounds in remuneration and deferred incentives handed out to Barclays' top bankers in 2010. And while much is made of the fact that Barclays' investment bank is now bigger than its UK retail operation, Britain still accounted for 40 percent of its total income in 2010, against 25 percent from the Americas. For all its readiness to import star bankers and investors, Barclays remains about as British as strawberries and cream at Wimbledon on a summer's day. Almost half of its loans are made in Britain and about 60,000 of its 147,500 staff are in the UK. Last year 80 percent of the 2,000 new jobs created by the bank were in the UK -- hardly a sign of an impending exodus. The least British of the major London-based banks is Standard Chartered, which does most of its business in Asia and Africa. Just nine percent of its $16 billion 2010 operating income came from Britain, Europe and the Americas last year. But it too is a great illustration of how institutions tend to pay the lion's share of corporation tax in the jurisdictions where the money is earned rather in their home base. The bank's nominal UK tax bill for 2010 was $871 million, but some $697 million of that was clawed back in the form of double taxation relief which prevents the same income being taxed twice in two different jurisdictions. In the end it paid $174 million in UK corporation tax, or 13 percent of its foreign tax bill and 10 percent of its total global tax bill -- broadly in line with the proportion of income generated in the UK. That would be unlikely to change even if Standard Chartered shifted to a new base. A VERY BRITISH AFFAIR None of that makes a bank move from London impossible, of course. But it is worth bearing in mind when confronted with clamorous headlines about how the government might force the banks to quit Britain. \"There's been a lot in the press about big companies moving offshore but there haven't been that many. There hasn't been a mass exodus,\" says Miller at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, told parliament last month that research by tax officials indicated 22 companies had left Britain for tax reasons over the last four years. One of the reasons for that may be the lure of London itself. The latest edition of the Z/Yen Global Financial Centers Index published last month -- which London has topped ever since the survey's inception in 2007 -- showed the British capital remained top choice among financial services professionals, although New York and Hong Kong were not far behind. London is an \"extraordinarily attractive\" place for bankers to live, says MP Leadsom, even if high-earners have been hit with more income tax. English-speaking, and located in a time zone between the booming markets of Asia and the world's biggest economy across the Atlantic, London also boasts good schools, luxury houses, and world-class restaurants. \"It's effectively the capital of the developed world,\" she says. \"We speak the international language of business here.\" In his appearance before parliamentarians earlier this year, Barclays' Diamond tried to capture the reasons why, for the moment at least, British is best. \"Over time there has been no city in the world that has benefited more or been more supportive of foreign trade and flows of business in and out of the city than London. So London has become a place that is recognized as very good for business and very good for talent,\" he told MPs. \"People have enjoyed living here, but it has been much more about companies feeling that this is good for business, it's good for raising capital and it's good for attracting talent.\" PR POWERHOUSES So why all the complaints about increased regulation in London? The truth is that banks everywhere are lobbying hard to limit new regulation. Threats to move are just one weapon in their armory, even if any change of corporate headquarters is unlikely while such uncertainty reins. Regular readers of German business papers will know that Deutsche Bank has often touted a move to London. Investment banks in the United States complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage to their rivals in Europe. Some argue that the Volcker Rule, which forces U.S. banks to exit profitable trading ventures where they used the firms' own money, could have an even more dramatic effect on their businesses than Europe's crackdown on pay. JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last month that new, higher capital requirements designed to protect banks from collapse would \"greatly diminish growth\" and risked \"putting the nail in our coffin for big American banks\". Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently wrote in the Financial Times that Wall Street reform under the Dodd-Frank Act \"may create the largest regulatory-induced market distortion since America's ill-fated imposition of wage and price controls in 1971\". Standard Chartered Chief Executive Peter Sands wrote in his review of the bank's 2010 performance that the biggest problem was the lack of predictability. \"Rather than seeing increasing global co-ordination and consistency of regulation, we are seeing increased fragmentation and unilateral action.\" Barclays' 2010 accounts flag \"greater regulatory related costs\" as a principal reason for rising administration expenses, but also show that the bank would need to carefully weigh up regulatory risks elsewhere before shifting bases. The bank paid $298 million last year to settle charges that it violated U.S. trade sanctions -- double the 96 million pound charge it took as part of its bill covering the cost of a 50 percent payroll tax slapped on bonuses by the UK government. The PR skills of the banks as they lobby to limit the damage from perceived over-regulation were not lost on the Bank of England's Executive Director for Financial Stability Andy Haldane when he argued in late 2009 that there was \"not so much as a scintilla of evidence of bigger being better in banking. \"It's true that the lobbying effort of the financial sector should not be underestimated,\" he told the BBC. \"Equally, the way to beat that back is by appealing to logic and to evidence.\" PRICE WORTH PAYING? And yet. Jon Terry, head of reward at PricewaterhouseCoopers, reflects the fears of many in London's financial services community when he warns of the reputational damage to the City caused by any high-profile departure and of the long-term, indirect consequences of tax and regulation policy changes. \"The biggest issue for me is what it means for the future and stability,\" Terry said. \"We're already seeing a number of large banking organisations, particularly overseas banks operating very large businesses in the UK, saying 'we are not going to expand that part of the business in the UK -- it's going to go somewhere else'.\" Chris Wheeler, banking analyst at Mediobanca, said the immediate impact of a withdrawal from London may be small, if embarrassing, but the risk was that it would grow. \"The odds are probably on them staying, but we'll see what comes out ... in case there's something there that's so toxic it makes life difficult,\" he said. \"If Barclays or HSBC pulled the plug there would be major prestige issues, lost taxations and all the add-on services.\" There is no sign that major investors are yet actively agitating for moves abroad but they are watching closely. \"All investors want is that everyone has the same rules. But if the UK is out of line, then that's a problem,\" said one of HSBC's top 10 shareholders, who spoke on condition of anonymity and pointed to HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered as the most likely to shift. \"Most of the banks want to stay -- none of them want to leave but if it was clear their valuation was going to be significantly different in another jurisdiction, they would go. It wouldn't take too much.\" Those outside the City argue that regulators should not be shy about setting the bar high if it means taxpayers feel their banking system is safer. Hundreds of millions of pounds in lost tax revenue may turn out to be small price to pay for offloading trillions of pounds in bank liabilities. \"As long as we continue to have institutions that are so big that they can bring down the rest of the economy, there will always be an implicit taxpayer subsidy and these banks will be able to borrow at interest rates much lower than they would in a competitive market,\" says New Economics Foundation's Prieg. The British public has shown its capacity (if not its enthusiasm) for bailing out major financial institutions. But any new host to HSBC would have to be ready to act as lender of last resort to an institution with a balance sheet bigger than all but the world's five largest economies. The Bank of England's Haldane has argued that Britain might do well to offload some of the risk inherent in such banking behemoths. \"Some of the downsides of carrying around a big financial system are now evident to all,\" he told the BBC. \"If some of that were to migrate overseas that would be unfortunate but given the costs of carrying that financial system around, it may be a price worth paying.\" (Reporting and writing by Paul Hoskins; Additional reporting by  Steve Slater ,  Myles Neligan ,  Sinead Cruise  and  Kirstin Ridley  in London; Editing by  Simon Robinson  and  Sara Ledwith )\n"

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Justice Department approved Google Inc's purchase of ITA Software with stiff conditions on Friday, and left the door open to a larger probe into whether Google manipulates its search results to hurt rivals. \n",
      "\n",
      " The Justice Department blessed the $700 million deal with the ticketing software company. Google promised to license the software for five years, to continue to upgrade it, and to establish firewalls to protect ITA clients' intellectual property. The ITA buy is part of an acquisition and hiring spree as Google aims to ensure its online services stay on top as Internet surfers go mobile and turn to services like the wildly popular Facebook. Now, U.S. antitrust regulators will turn to the question of whether to open a formal antitrust probe into allegations that Google, the world's No. 1 Internet search engine, manipulates search results, a source told Reuters on Friday. The Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department are both contemplating an investigation but there has been no decision made on which agency may take it up. There has been a series of complaints made to the agencies -- many from Google rivals that specialize in searches such as price comparison websites -- that Google has made them difficult to find. A key lawmaker has been critical of Google, and remained so on Friday. \"We continue to scrutinize broader questions about the fairness of Google's search engine, and whether it preferences its own products and services to the detriment of competitors,\" said Sen. Herb Kohl, chairman of the Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee. The European Commission took up an antitrust probe after complaints from three small companies, one of them owned by Microsoft. Microsoft charged that Google hurt competition by \"walling off\" content on its YouTube site, so other search engines cannot display accurate results. It also said that Google made it hard for Microsoft's mobile phone software to show videos from YouTube, among other charges. The Justice Department was also aware that Google had an incentive to tweak search results to favor its businesses and was keeping an eye on the issue, said a Justice Department official who requested anonymity. \"There were a variety of complaints about bias in search,\" the official said. \"So, while we're aware of those complaints we did not think they were relevant to this (ITA) transaction.\" Analysts said they believed that Google's power in search meant the company had to step carefully, and that a broader probe was a big worry. \"A lot of these new markets that they enter rely heavily on search to drive traffic,\" said Yun Kim, an analyst with Gleacher & Co. \"That's what the government is worried about.\" CONDITIONS PLACED ON GOOGLE BUY OF ITA Google said in July that it would buy ITA Software for $700 million in cash. The announcement sparked concerns that travel websites such as Kayak and TripAdvisor could be deprived of ITA's software. ITA's QPX is used by leading airlines and travel distributors like Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Microsoft's Bing and Hotwire, among others. Disputes between Google and the online travel websites -- for example over fees -- are to be submitted to arbitration, the Justice Department said. Google said it was \"excited\" to get the deal approved, and would soon bring out a new travel search tool. \"We're moving to close this acquisition as soon as possible, and then we'll start the important work of bringing our teams and products together,\" wrote Jeff Huber, a Google senior vice president, in a blog post. Google shares dipped 0.3 percent to close at $578.16 on Friday. (Additional reporting by  Alexei Oreskovic  and  Jeremy Pelofsky ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Matthew Lewis )\n",

      "\n",
      " The lawsuit blamed JPMorgan banker Ted Ufferfilge for losing $98 million in an account owned by Blavatnik's industrial holding company, Access Industries, by betting on risky mortgage securities. Claims for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation could go forward, New York State Supreme Court Judge Melvin Schweitzer ruled on Friday. Claims for breach of contract were dismissed in part. The ruling applies to an amended complaint filed in December 2010 after parts of the original complaint were dismissed. According to the lawsuit, Access had hired JPMorgan's investment management unit to manage the investment account, called CMMF, with conservative objectives. Instead, the bank and Ufferfilge invested in risky and illiquid mortgage-related securities, at the same time that JPMorgan was shedding the same kind of assets in its own portfolios, according to court filings. The lawsuit also claimed that JPMorgan should have looked behind the credit ratings assigned to the securities by rating agencies, and independently assessed the securities' actual risk. But the judge dismissed that claim, saying the bank had no obligation to do so. However, the judge ruled that claims of negligence could go forward because JPMorgan increased CMMF's exposure to residential real estate while the sector was imploding -- and as it was reducing other clients' exposure to the sector. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment. An attorney for CMMF could not be reached for comment. The case is CMMF LLC vs J.P.

The aluminum producer is expected to report quarterly earnings of 27 cents per share on revenue of $6.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. Some top financial names are also expected to report next week, including JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) is also due to report. \"Earnings are what the market is all about. Earnings are critical in here, guidance is critical in here, the conference calls are critical in here,\" said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. \"In terms of earnings and sectors, you basically want to be with those people who have the ability to raise prices or are participating in the commodity price increases,\" he said. \"And you really don't want to be in those people who have the input costs increases and are going to see their margins squeezed by rising commodity prices.

But analysts said that while a U.S. government shutdown, which would idle hundreds of thousands of federal workers, would be short-term negative, the market had managed to rally even ahead of the looming deadline. \"There is an intellectual concern of what it means to shut down the government and there is the uncertainty of how long does the government get shut down and how much of a (hit) do we take on GDP growth,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated Investors, in New York. Many traders circled short-term puts on the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ( SPY.P ) as the prospect of a shutdown loomed. Shares of the exchange-traded fund, also called the Spyders, fell 0.3 percent to $132.86 in afternoon trading on Friday. The fund's Weekly $133 puts traded more than 96,000 contracts, surpassing their open interest. Frederic Ruffy, a strategist at WhatsTrading.com, said the positions likely reflected hedges against weakness due to fears of a shutdown. Investors will also eye a batch of economic data next week, providing more insight into the economic recovery, including the consumer and producer prices indexes, the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index and the Federal Reserve's Beige Book of economic activity. \"The inflation numbers will certainly be important -- producer price index and consumer price index -- the expectation is inflation will be higher than the Federal Reserve will feel comfortable with,\" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York. \"The focus next week will clearly be on the earnings numbers and the economic numbers and that is where the focus of the market should be.\" (Additional reporting by  Doris Frankel ; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n"

      " TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Taiwan smartphone maker HTC Corp said first-quarter profit almost tripled, beating forecasts, driven by strong demand for its handsets, particularly those running on the Android operating system \n",
      "\n",
      " The company, which has just overtaken erstwhile industry giant Nokia Oyj in terms of market capitalization, said on Friday that unaudited first-quarter net profit was T$14.83 billion ($511 million). Analysts had forecast a profit of T$12.99 billion. \"That its first quarter would be above expectations was well foreseen, Q1 seasonality was better than expected,\" said Bonnie Chang, an analyst at Yuanta Securities in Hong Kong. \"For the second quarter everyone is expecting revenue sequential growth in the high teens to 20 percent, shipments will be strong and average selling prices are holding up pretty well.\" Growing demand for phones running on Google's Android platform will help the smartphone market grow in 2011, boosting companies such as HTC and Samsung Electronics who are betting on the platform. The smartphone market is likely to grow 58 percent this year and 35 percent the next, according to research firm Gartner. Android's popularity has helped Asian manufacturers to rise fast in smartphone rankings. HTC's market capitalization topped that of Nokia earlier in the week after a 29 percent surge in its share price so far this year. The shares touched a high of T$1,220 on April 7 this year, more than triple the T$360.5 on April 6, 2010. That surge has helped turn its chairwoman, Cher Wang, into Taiwan's richest person. On Friday, the shares closed down 3.3 percent at T$1,160 versus the benchmark index's 0.08 percent fall. Yuanta's Chang said she expected to raise her price target for the shares to around T$1,300 to T$1,400, where she expected most other broker targets to be. HTC said consolidated sales for March reached T$37 billion, more than double the same month a year earlier. First-quarter revenues reached T$104.2 billion. The company did not elaborate in its statement. It has said at the beginning of the year that it expected revenue and shipments would be more than double in the first quarter this year, helped by a new generation of products.

      " (Reuters) - The White House and Congress have until midnight on Friday to agree to a budget bill or there will be a partial shutdown of the U.S. government. The dispute is over funding for the remainder of the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. \n",
      "\n",
      " Republicans and Democrats say they want to avoid a shutdown, which could idle hundreds of thousands of federal workers, close national parks and Washington's Smithsonian Institution museums. If there is no deal, many official websites would darken and furloughed government workers would be required to power down their BlackBerries at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on Saturday. The federal work force numbers about 4.4 million, including members of the U.S. military. Here are some facts about what could happen. WHO WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED? The military, law enforcement, FBI, prison guards, Customs and Border Protection, U.S. marshals, the U.S. Postal Service and any services deemed essential for the safety of lives and the protection of property. That would include air traffic controllers and federal disaster operations, as well as national weather and earthquake-monitoring operations. The distribution of food stamps and other child nutrition benefits, as well as NASA satellite missions. Also, any federal service with an alternative source of funding to annual congressional appropriations, like fees or operations financed through multiyear appropriations. HOW MANY FEDERAL WORKERS WOULD BE IDLED? Based on the last federal government shutdown, from December 16, 1995, until January 6, 1996, about 800,000 federal workers would be furloughed, including a \"significant number\" of civilian contractors working for the Defense Department, the White House said. The White House Office of Management and Budget said it was up to Congress to decide on back pay for furloughed workers, but the Obama administration would support reimbursement. After the 1995 and 1996 shutdowns, Congress approved back pay for furloughed employees. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE MILITARY? Operations in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq and Japan would not be affected. Military personnel would not receive paychecks -- although they would continue to earn salaries -- because the government would have no money to pay out during a shutdown. SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE Social Security and Medicare benefits for the elderly would continue to be paid. But help lines would not be staffed. TAXES The shutdown would occur during tax preparation and filing season -- federal income taxes are due by April 18. That would delay tax refunds to Americans who filed a paper -- rather than electronic -- tax return, or about 30 percent of the total number of returns. Electronic tax collection and refunds would continue. IRS tax audits would be suspended. PARKS AND MUSEUMS National parks, national forests and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington would close. But tourists in Washington, D.C., will at least be able to enjoy the city's annual Cherry Blossom Parade -- organizers said city police would organize an alternate parade route that would avoid federal land. FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION The Federal Housing Administration would not be able to endorse any single-family mortgage loans or have staff available to process and approve new multifamily loans. The White House says that as FHA single-family lending represents more than 20 percent of the overall loan volume of home purchases and refinancings, this would be a hard hit on the housing market. OTHER SERVICES AFFECTED? During the last shutdown, an estimated 200,000 applications for U.S. passports went unprocessed and work on more than 3,500 bankruptcy cases were suspended. * New patients would not be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, although clinical trials already in progress would continue. * The Small Business Administration's approval of applications of business loan guarantees and direct loans to small businesses would stop. * Daily life in the U.S. capital would also be affected. While schools would stay open and police and other safety services would continue, trash collection would be suspended for a week and street sweeping would cease. Public libraries and the Department of Motor Vehicles would close.

      " Democrats and Republicans will have to deal with the fallout from the past week's bitter partisan budget brinkmanship, regardless of whether it drives the federal government to shut down. We will assess who lost most from the crisis, with a Reuters/IPSOS poll on Tuesday. We will also feature an in-depth look at the performance of Republican House Speaker John Boehner, who had to deal with hardline Tea Party-affiliated party members as well as more accommodating colleagues. No matter how much progress was made on the 2011 budget, the House is expected to vote and pass during the week the Republican proposal for a fiscal 2012 budget, which includes long-term cuts of trillions of dollars and a revamp of costly government healthcare programs. LIBYA - A NEW QUAGMIRE? The United States and its allies are trying to halt the crumbling of the armed rebellion in Libya while remaining within the restrictions of the U.N. mandate. That means sticking to air attacks and aid for stricken areas. Washington is skeptical of the viability of the rebellion. While there are no strong signs it is a Jihadist movement, there is great concern that without solid training, and probably arming, the rebels have no hope of prevailing against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on their own. We will follow how Washington views the rebels, how the Obama administration envisages resolving the stalemate and whether it can accept Gaddafi remaining in power. G20, IMF MEET AS OIL CASTS CLOUD ON RECOVERY Top finance officials from the Group of 20 rich and emerging-market nations make their spring pilgrimage to Washington, meeting on the sidelines of semi-annual sessions of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Issues they will pick over range from soaring oil prices to how to correct trade imbalances. Sessions on Friday will consider how to set \"indicative guidelines\" to help nations react when excessive trade surpluses, inflation or other economic threats are apparent. To be sure, no one is looking for a definite answer on what such guidelines should look like, or when they need to come into effect. The talks will come against a backdrop of a revised IMF assessment of global growth prospects, due on Monday. It likely will express worry that surging energy prices are casting a cloud across an already hazy outlook for growth. PERU Leftist Ollanta Humala is forecast to win the first round of Peru's tight presidential election on Sunday, but it is not clear who he will face in a run-off expected on June 5 since he will not get 50 percent of the vote. Investors are worried that Humala will roll back reforms that have pulled Peru from the hyperinflation and guerrilla violence of two decades ago and made it one of the world's fastest-growing economies and a top global producer of copper, zinc, gold and silver. Poor Peruvians left out of the boom have rallied behind the former soldier turned populist leader. Right-winger Keiko Fujimori, former President Alberto Toledo and former Finance Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski are vying for second place on Sunday. Any one of them could unite opposition to stop Humala in the run-off. CUBA Cuba's ruling Communist Party will hold its first congress in 14 years April 16-19 to approve economic reforms introduced by President Raul Castro. The changes will allow greater private initiative by Cuban citizens in the Soviet-style state-run economy. Cuba has not held a congress since 1997, perhaps to avoid public debate of the sorry state of the economy. The PCC is the only legal party in Cuba and its most powerful political body. The congress is expected to be largely a formality since Fidel Castro clarified last month that he had resigned as secretary general due to his illness. Raul is expected to be confirmed in the post. It could well mark the last party congress at which someone from the aging generation that led the 1959 revolution is in charge. MARKETS Stocks move into earnings mode next week with JP Morgan, Bank of America and Google among the first to report. Trading volume was low in Q1, so downside surprises may hit financial stocks, already sluggish of late. The U.S. Treasury sells $66 billion in three, 10 and 30-year debt even in the event of a government shutdown, and the recent rise in yields could drive demand. Foreign exchange trends remain in place, including a stronger euro and a weaker yen. That said, the euro is nearing $1.45 and worries about European debt could hit a market where momentum and relative strength indexes show the European currency is stretched. U.S. ECONOMY AND HIGH ENERGY PRICES Retail sales and inflation data could yield fresh clues on the impact of rising energy prices on the U.S. economy -- if a government shutdown does not delay their release. Sales probably rose for a ninth straight month in March, but gasoline station receipts are expected to account for the bulk of the gain. Rising gas and food costs are stealing spending from other sectors of the economy, which could slow growth. High commodity costs are expected to keep headline inflation elevated in March, but underlying price pressures are seen muted as economic slack limits the pricing power of businesses. Core CPI is seen rising 0.2 percent in March. Manufacturing data will likely confirm factories continue to power the recovery.\n"

      " WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are conducting a broad review of share issuance rules for private companies, including the 500-shareholder threshold meant to mark the transition to public ownership. \n",
      "\n",
      " The Securities and Exchange Commission review could make it easier for private companies to raise capital while delaying an initial public offering and the accompanying increase in financial disclosures. \"We are approaching it with an open mind,\" SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said of the policy review on Friday to a group of business journalists. \"I really can't predict what, if any, change will come out of that.\" The issue has jumped into the spotlight recently as Wall Street banks and electronic markets offer investors a chance to buy and actively trade stakes in hot Internet companies such as Facebook and Twitter before they go public. An April 6 letter from the SEC to House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa sets out the issues involved in the review but is careful not to come to any conclusions. The use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, that aggregate investors and help avoid the 500 threshold, is among the issues being examined, as is the increasingly active trading of private shares on electronic platforms. SEC rules on what constitutes a \"general solicitation\" for investors, banned for private placements, is also under scrutiny. Goldman Sachs had planned to offer both U.S. and foreign investors a chance to own shares in Facebook through an SPV. Later in January it opted to limit the offering to foreign investors, citing \"intense media coverage\" of the deal. The effects of any SEC rule changes could be mixed. Raising the 500 investor threshold, for example, could be offset by tighter rules on SPVs. The rules also affect public companies that seek to \"go dark\" by returning to private ownership status. \"Many of the rules we have in place governing the offering process are decades old,\" Schapiro said on Friday. \"It makes sense for us ... to take a look at whether our rules have kept pace with changing market dynamics.\" Schapiro's letter to Issa showed an SEC wrestling with the needs of private companies to raise capital against the investing public's right to get the information they need to make informed decisions. \"I think all Mary Schapiro is really saying is that she wants a more realistic counting system that is less susceptible to manipulation,\" said J. Robert Brown, a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. (Reporting by Sarah N. Lynch and Clare Baldwin; Additional reporting by  Chris Baltimore  in Dallas; editing by Gerald E.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Here's some advice for anyone hoping not to get caught in an insider trading web: Shut up. \n",
      "\n",
      " After the October 2009 arrest of Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, who was wiretapped by the FBI, the world woke to a new era of prosecutorial tactics in insider trading probes. For those considering crossing the line, the changes may make insider trading seem a vocation not worth the risk. Emails and other forms of electronic communication can be traced. Destroying old-fashioned snail mail or hard drives will not work if the government gets a tip it is being done. And don't talk to people. There is no certainty that what is said will remain private. Indeed, recent phone recordings make some accused wrongdoers come across as Keystone Kriminals. \"Insider trading today is a lot more difficult to get away with than it was 20 years ago,\" said Andrew Stoltmann, a principal at Stoltmann Law Offices PC in Chicago who has handled civil insider trading cases. \"Prosecutors really are cracking down. And there are electronic trails left behind.\" GARBAGE CANS AND GARBAGE TRUCKS A recent proliferation of cases against fund managers, traders and lawyers shows a new aggression, especially in the use of wiretaps and recorded phone calls to build cases. The latest illustration: this week's arrests of lawyer Matthew Kluger and trader Garrett Bauer. Prosecutors say the men ran a 17-year conspiracy tied to tips on mergers that Kluger stole while working at high-octane law firms. They have yet to enter pleas in the case. Twelve single-spaced pages of a criminal complaint detail nervous calls that Kluger or Bauer had with an unnamed co-conspirator, once they thought the government was on their tails. \"I got rid of my computer,\" Kluger was recorded as saying on March 17. \"I got rid of my iPhone where I had looked up some stock quotes. Those are gone. I mean history. Gone.\" Bauer was recorded a day later as needing more effort to dump his prepaid cellphone. \"I broke the phone in half and went to McDonald's and put it in two different garbage cans,\" he said, according to the complaint. \"Someone was watching me. I thought it was an FBI agent. And I asked him, 'Do you know me? You look familiar.'\" Prosecutors say hedge fund manager Donald Longueuil, a defendant in another insider trading case, used a similar modus operandi. They contend he once took to the streets of Manhattan at 2 a.m. to find places to toss a flash drive and two hard drives that had incriminating evidence. \"I go on like a 20-block walk,\" he said in a recorded conversation. \"And threw the shit in the back of like random garbage trucks, different garbage trucks ... four different garbage trucks.\" Then there were Bonnie and Yonni -- former Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) assistant Bonnie Hoxie and her boyfriend Yonni Sebbag. Last year, Sebbag tried to sell Disney secrets that Hoxie learned at her job to some 30 hedge funds and other investors. Prosecutors said he used a FedEx Kinko's computer for the deed. Bad idea. Google found the computer, and several funds went to the authorities. Both defendants admitted their guilt. Sebbag was sentenced to 27 months in prison. Hoxie got probation. CANADA TOO Two years ago, Canadian prosecutors said lawyer Gil Cornblum and his friend Stanko Grmovsek relied on pay phones for several years as part of a 14-year insider trading conspiracy based on secrets Cornblum learned at his job. Cornblum committed suicide by jumping from a Toronto bridge in October 2009, a day before Grmovsek pleaded guilty. Prosecutors say Rajaratnam, a one-time billionaire, also tried to cover his tracks. Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty. He is set to begin his defense next week in Manhattan federal court, in Wall Street's bigger insider trading case since the prosecutions of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken more than two decades ago. Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey & Co consultant arrested with Rajaratnam and now cooperating with the government, last month testified to having lolled with his longtime friend in a pair of deck chairs in Miami Beach, just prior to their arrests. \"You know, Anil, I'm told there's a gentleman who used to work for me and he's now wearing a wire,\" Kumar recalled Rajaratnam as saying. \"You should be careful,\" Kumar said he responded. \"You should make prepaid phone calls to me.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by John Wallace)\n",

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson will pay $78 million to settle U.S. and UK charges that it paid bribes and kickbacks to win business overseas, the first big drug company to settle since the Obama administration began its scrutiny of the industry more than a year ago. \n",
      "\n",
      " Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay a $21.4 million fine to settle Justice Department criminal charges and pay more than $48.6 million in disgorgement and interest to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agencies said on Friday. The allegations date back to 1998 and involved sham contracts, bribes and kickbacks paid by J&J units to officials and doctors in Greece, Iraq, Poland and Romania to help earn millions of dollars in profits, according to authorities. The New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant also settled a similar complaint with the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office for conduct by its DePuy Inc subsidiary, agreeing to pay some $7.9 million plus prosecution costs. The U.S. Justice Department announced in November 2009 that it would focus on prosecuting those in the pharmaceutical industry who try to bribe foreign officials for preferential treatment of their products, leading to a wide-ranging probe. U.S. authorities praised the cooperation by the company, its remedial efforts and said that it helped identify improper practices in the industry. The criminal fine was reduced in light of the company's cooperation. \"We are committed to holding corporations accountable for bribing foreign officials while, at the same time, giving meaningful credit to companies that self-report and cooperate with our investigations,\" said Mythili Raman, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ criminal division. MORE SETTLEMENTS COMING? Other companies have disclosed similar probes and experts believe more settlements are in the offing. Eli Lilly & Co has previously said that it was under scrutiny by the U.S. government over its compliance with bribery laws in a number of countries including Poland. The company has said it was cooperating with authorities. Baxter International has also said that it has received a request from the Justice Department and SEC for information about its practices overseas related to U.S. bribery laws and that it was cooperating as well. The settlement comes at a tough time for J&J, which has been grappling with recalls of Tylenol and other products. The company has recalled more than 300 million bottles and packages of adult and children's consumer medicines in the past 15 months. Although no injuries have been linked to the recalls, they have sullied J&J's reputation, pressured its share price and sparked Congressional investigations. Johnson & Johnson shares reversed gains after news of the bribery settlement emerged. They were down 4 cents at $59.44 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Authorities accused J&J units of paying bribes to public doctors in Greece to select its surgical implants and in Romania to prescribe its medicines, earning the company millions of dollars in profits. J&J subsidiaries were also accused of paying bribes to public doctors and hospital administrators in Poland to win contracts and of paying kickbacks to Iraq to win 19 contracts under the U.N.'s Oil for Food Program. Iraq had demanded that companies pay a 10 percent fee in order to do business with the Saddam Hussein government, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement. \"More than four years ago, we went to the (U.S.) government to report improper payments and have taken full responsibility for these actions,\" J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Weldon said in a statement. J&J did not admit or deny the SEC's allegations but acknowledged responsibility in the Justice Department case for the actions of its units, employees and agents who made the improper payments. Under the settlement, J&J will enter into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department.

      " TORONTO  (Reuters) - They're sleek, sexy and fun. They're also revolutionizing the way financial advisers do business. \n",
      "\n",
      " A host of adviser-specific apps have taken iPads and other tablets from nifty playthings to seductive business tools that can dazzle and truly educate clients, advocates say. \"It's really a new paradigm,\" said David Wisehaupt, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Wisehaupt Bray Asset Management, a unit of Chicago-based independent brokerage HighTower. \"I'm with a client, be they young or old, and ... they sort of can't help themselves -- before the meeting is over, they're manipulating the images on the screen.\" Wisehaupt, a 29-year financial services industry veteran who works with high-net-worth clients, said the charts, research and portfolio analytics he displays on his tablet screen connect with clients more than one-sided dissertations or lectures. The interactive experience helps clients retain more information and feel more secure about his stewardship of their assets, he said. DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY Bill Winterberg, whose technology consulting firm FP Pad in Dallas, Texas, specializes in working with independent advisers, calls tablets a \"disruptive technology\" that improves productivity and mobility. He pointed to apps that enable advisers to access customer relationship management and portfolio management tools. For instance, there's Orion Advisor Services' MobileAdvisor app, which displays portfolios, performance information and contact information. It also allows advisers using Orion's platform to rebrand the app, so clients download it, log in, track their portfolios, and view videos that the adviser provides. For security purposes, the data is kept on the Omaha-based company's servers rather than directly on the tablet. Security is the primary compliance concern for advisers using iPads, Winterberg said. At a minimum, he recommends pass code locks and password protection for the tablets. Users also can use a service from Apple called MobileMe that homes in on lost iPads and allows all data to be erased remotely if the tablet is online. INTELLIGENT PAPER Some brokerage firms are beginning to embrace tablet technology. Canada's No. 3 lender, Bank of Nova Scotia, is looking at arming its wealth managers with Research In Motion's upcoming BlackBerry PlayBook. Firms like Charles Schwab Corp, TD Ameritrade, which offer custody and business services to independent registered investment advisers and others have been introducing apps that allow advisers and their clients to do some trading directly from their iPads. HighTower's Wisehaupt is a fan of an application called LogMeIn that connects him via his iPad to his office desktop if a secure Wi-Fi or other 3G mobile connection is available. When a client has a question, the information is always at his fingertips. \"Signing in, getting it and showing it to clients live is powerful,\" he said. Other popular web-based applications keep track of call records, conversation notes and updated contact information. \"It's the convenience factor,\" said Winterberg. \"They can do the same with the laptop, but they're not going to get the battery life from a laptop, and they don't get necessarily the portability factor of being able to just hold it in one hand and look up this information.\" There is also the social factor. If a client is worried about retirement and the adviser is busy typing away behind a keyboard, it can seem disrespectful, said Alessandro Tonchia, founder and director of Finantix, which offers a suite of wealth management apps for iPads, iPhones, and Android-smartphones. \"The iPad has the same social acceptability as a piece of paper, but it has all the power of an interactive device,\" Tonchia said. \"We present it is as intelligent paper.\" ($1=$0.96 Canadian) (Reporting by John McCrank; editing by Rob Wilson)\n",

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Raj Rajaratnam's lawyers plan to call five witnesses to testify for the defense at his insider trading trial, including a former top executive at his hedge fund. \n",
      "\n",
      " When the Manhattan federal court trial enters its sixth week on Monday, defense attorneys will begin their leg of the case. Rajaratnam lawyer Terence Lynam told the judge on Friday he planned to call two former Galleon employees, including its one-time chief operating officer Rick Schutte. Schutte is expected to back the defense's argument that research, analysis and market speculation, not material company secrets, guided trading at Galleon, which had $7 billion under management at its peak. Former Galleon analyst Stephen Granoff may also take the witness stand. In what prosecutors have called the biggest probe of insider trading at hedge funds on record, Sri Lankan-born Rajaratnam, 53, is charged with 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. Prosecutors have played numerous wiretapped recordings of Rajaratnam's phone calls with high-placed friends in corporate America. The government contends he made more than $50 million in illicit trading profits between 2003 and March 2009. The trial, which began in early March, was expected to last up to two months. But defense attorneys said they might take only two days to present their witnesses, resting their case as early as Tuesday. A looming U.S. government shutdown was not expected to have an impact on the Rajaratnam court proceedings. The impasse was not mentioned at a court hearing on the case on Friday. At the hearing, where no jurors were present, Rajaratnam's lawyers told U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell they first planned to call two witnesses to refute earlier testimony from former Galleon employee and government cooperator Adam Smith. Hedge fund owner John Pernell and lawyer Robert Hotz will be called to the stand to contradict what former Smith told jurors, Lynam said. Smith, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy in January, testified that he supplied Rajaratnam with inside stock tips from a friend who worked as an investment banker. Hotz is a partner at Rajaratnam defense law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Pernell owns Polaris Investment Partners Inc. Prosecutors said they would file papers later on Friday asking the judge not to let the two men testify. The judge on Friday also allowed defense expert Gregg Jarrell, a professor at the University of Rochester's William Simon School of Business, to testify next week. Prosecutors had objected to parts of his proposed testimony. Rajaratnam, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, has sat silently amid his lawyers at the trial as prosecutors brought on a parade of witnesses and played recordings of his telephone conversations. Asked by the judge whether Rajaratnam would take the stand, defense lawyer John Dowd said he would tell the prosecutors \"in a timely way.\" The case is USA v Raj Rajaratnam et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.

      " BOSTON  (Reuters) - Cross two more names off the list of 3M Co ( MMM.N ) insiders who could succeed George Buckley as chief executive if he steps down when he turns 65 next year. \n",
      "\n",
      " The diversified U.S. manufacturer, which has a tradition of ending its CEOs' contracts at that age, said on Friday that Executive Vice President Jean Lobey, 58, and Senior Vice President Robert MacDonald, 60, will retire in the next two months. Those looming departures, along with Chief Financial Officer Patrick Campbell's upcoming retirement, could signal some of the top brass at the maker of products ranging from Post-It notes to optical films used in flat-panel televisions no longer think they have a shot at the corner office. \"Given that you now have three executives leaving in a relatively short period of time, there is a possibility that there was some thought that they may have had a chance at that position, which is not the case at this point,\" said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. The company has named replacements from within 3M for all three executives, who are due to retire in May and June. Julie Bushman will succeed Lobey, overseeing the safety, security and protection business, Ian Hardgrove will replace MacDonald, heading marketing and sales, and David Meline will take over from Campbell. CEO WANTS TO STAY Buckley, who joined 3M as CEO from Brunswick Corp ( BC.N ) in 2005, has made no secret of his desire to stay on past his contract's expiration date in February 2012. \"I love being the CEO of 3M,\" Buckley told investors in March. \"I'm not the guy that has the choice on whether I stay or not.\" That choice lies with the company's 10-member board of directors -- which Buckley has a seat on. The board is expected to choose whether to break with its tradition and extend Buckley's contract in the coming months. \"If you have a CEO that is excited, and I think doing a pretty terrific job, why not keep him on if he wants to stay?\" said Adam Fleck, an equity analyst with Morningstar in Chicago. 3M shares were up 1 cent at $93.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Both Buckley and his predecessor James McNerney, a former General Electric Co ( GE.N ) executive who now heads Boeing Co ( BA.N ), were brought in from the outside. McNerney, who joined in 2000, is credited with vastly improving 3M's profit margins at a time when they were low while analysts say Buckley's mark on the company has been a resurgence of research. But analysts expect the 109-year old company, which employs more than 80,000 people worldwide, to choose its next leader from among its current executive ranks. Even with the current round of retirements, 3M has a deep bench of executives with decades of experience at the company, including Inge Thulin, executive vice president of international operations and Brad Sauer, executive vice president of its health care unit. \"If you started to see a lot of the vice president heads of the divisions starting to say, 'I'm out of here,' that would be more concerning to me,\" Fleck said. \"It's encouraging to read reports that the company wants to return to promoting from within.\" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)\n"

      "-- With no budget deal, government shutdown looms\n",

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democratic and Republican leaders traded blame on Friday in a budget impasse that threatened to shut down the U.S. government within hours and idle hundreds of thousands of federal workers. \n",
      "\n",
      " With a midnight (0400 GMT on Saturday) deadline looming, President Barack Obama's aides and U.S. lawmakers struggled for a deal over government funding for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30. But the two sides could not even agree on what issues were holding up an agreement. Democrats said they were at odds over federal funding for birth control. Republicans said spending cuts were the issue. Without an agreement, money to operate the federal government for the next six months would run out at midnight on Friday (0400 GMT on Saturday) and agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service would begin a partial shutdown. Congressional staffers were making some progress in last-minute talks, a Republican aide said. But it was unclear whether a deal, even for a few extra days of stopgap funding, could be struck in time. Obama scrapped a family weekend trip to Williamsburg, Virginia, to stay home and monitor events. The bitter political fight raised questions about the ability of Obama and a divided U.S. Congress to deal with bigger issues looming down the road, from raising the federal debt ceiling to reining in budget deficits, as the 2012 presidential election campaign gathers steam. \"They've got to be laughing at us right now\" in China, said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry. \"How terrific that the United States of America can't make a decision.\" The leadership of the world's lone remaining superpower has been consumed for days by the budgetary infighting that could bring large swathes of government to a standstill. The White House said a shutdown would idle about 800,000 federal government workers and could slow the U.S. economic recovery. Vital services such as defense, law enforcement, emergency medical care and air traffic control would continue. Without a deal, many official websites would darken and furloughed government workers would be required to turn off Blackberries. Trash would go uncollected in Washington, and national parks and monuments like the Statue of Liberty in New York would close. Investment firm Goldman Sachs estimates a government shutdown lasting more than a week could cost the economy $8 billion in missed federal spending, dragging down growth. AT ODDS Republican and Democratic aides said negotiators have agreed to $38 billion in cuts but remain at odds over where they would fall. Republicans are resisting a Democratic proposal to cut $1.7 billion from defense. Obama called House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the top Democrat, about the continuing talks. Reid said the final issue was a Republican push to give states greater discretion over federal funds earmarked for birth control and women's health clinics. Democrats say that would give Republican governors license to block those funds. \"Republicans want to shut down the government because they think there's nothing more important than keeping women from getting cancer screenings. This is indefensible and everyone should be outraged,\" Reid said on the Senate floor. But Boehner said the final stumbling block was spending cuts that Republicans say are needed to rein in budget deficits hitting $1.4 trillion a year. \"We're not going to roll over and sell out the American people like has been done time and time again in Washington. When we say we're serious about cutting spending, we're damn serious about it.\" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he expected lawmakers to reach agreement on a spending plan and avert a government shutdown. Fear that a government shutdown could hurt economic growth on the margins pressured the dollar and U.S. Treasury prices on Friday. Longer-term, investors are looking at the last shutdown, in 1995, when predictions of spending cuts made government debt and the dollar more appealing and both rose. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, noted the budget debate is raising concern among foreign investors about how the U.S. government will deal with the budget deficit, federal debt and the budget talks for the 2012 fiscal year, which begins October 1. The showdown is the biggest test of leadership for Obama, a Democrat, and congressional leaders since Republicans made big gains and took control of the House of Representatives in elections last November. The confrontation carries big political risks for both parties, who could be seen by voters as failing to make compromises. But Boehner is under pressure to stand firm in the talks from Tea Party conservatives who helped fuel last year's big Republican election gains. The budget battle has dominated Obama's agenda even as he struggles to balance Americans' chief concerns -- jobs and the economy -- with foreign policy challenges topped by Middle East turmoil and U.S. military involvement in the Libyan conflict. Reid said Senate Democrats planned to vote on a one-week funding extension that would fund the Pentagon for the year but include no spending cuts to give more time for negotiations. Obama threatened to veto a bill passed by the Republican-led House for a one-week extension that included another $12 billion in spending cuts. Republicans said they would not allow a vote on a stopgap measure to keep the government operating beyond midnight on Friday unless it contains additional spending cuts. Any deal reached at this point would require several days to implement, meaning Congress will have to pass some sort of short-term bill to keep the government functioning.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - After piloting the No. 2 U.S. bank through the financial crisis relatively unscathed, JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is now being extremely well rewarded. \n",
      "\n",
      " Dimon's total compensation jumped nearly 1,500 percent to $20.8 million in 2010 from $1.3 million a year earlier, based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation formula, a regulatory filing showed. Dimon did even better in terms of the value of money and shares actually received: his salary, bonus and stock and options from grants made largely in previous years that were actually exercised in 2010 were worth around $42 million. By way of comparison, real median U.S. household income was just $49,777 in 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Large pay packages for bankers who oversaw transactions that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse in 2008 have become a flash point for investors. Anger has eased, but banker pay remains a sensitive issue, especially toward lenders that took taxpayer bailout money. Many analysts view JPMorgan as the healthiest of the largest U.S. commercial banks, having skirted the worst of the credit losses that hurt many rivals including Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Citigroup Inc ( C.N ). They credit the 55-year-old Dimon, who became chief executive on December 31, 2005, for having enabled JPMorgan to quickly repay its $25 billion of bailout money. JPMorgan is also one of the first big banks to raise its dividend after passing a second Federal Reserve \"stress\" test. However, Dimon has criticized regulatory reforms by the Obama administration, saying they could crimp growth. In his annual shareholder letter posted on the bank's website, Dimon said JPMorgan could earn $22 billion to $24 billion in a \"more normal\" environment, up from $17.4 billion in 2010. He said profit has fallen short because mortgage losses have been \"extraordinarily high,\" at $4 billion a year and that such losses will remain \"elevated\" for a while. THREE YEARS TO SELL HOME Dimon's 2010 salary remained at $1 million. He was also awarded a $5 million bonus, nearly $8 million in stock awards and $6.2 million in option awards, according to the SEC's compensation formula. His 2010 compensation also included $579,624 worth of perks, including $421,458 of \"moving expenses,\" $95,293 to use company aircraft and $45,730 for personal automobile use. Most of the rest went toward home security. Like many Americans who have had trouble selling their homes, Dimon did too. The moving expenses relate to the sale in 2010 of Dimon's Chicago-area home, in which he had lived while heading Bank One Corp that was sold to JPMorgan in 2004. Dimon put the home up for sale in 2007 when his family moved to New York. Dimon's total compensation in 2010 fell short of the $35.8 million he was awarded in 2008, according to the SEC formula. Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein saw compensation jump to $14.1 million in 2010 from $1 million, another regulatory filing shows. Other bank CEOs had lower compensation in 2010. Wells Fargo & Co's ( WFC.N ) John Stumpf saw compensation fall to $19 million from $21.3 million. Bank of America's Brian Moynihan saw compensation fall 70 percent to about $1.9 million, although in early 2011 he got a $9.1 million bonus. Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit's compensation was $1 in 2010, but his salary alone has risen to $1.75 million in 2011. JPMorgan shares closed down 0.5 percent at $47.40 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

      "-- By  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa\n",
      "-- Fri Apr 8, 2011 10:40am EDT\n",

      " KNOXVILLE, Tennessee  (Reuters) - Americans still expect inflation to remain stable, making it unlikely that recent spikes in commodity costs will lead to runaway increases in prices, a top Federal Reserve official said on Friday. \n",
      "\n",
      " Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, said he expects moderate economic growth to gradually bring down U.S. unemployment, which has come down rapidly in recent months but remains at an elevated 8.8 percent. A mix of demand from rapidly growing emerging economies and fears of supply disruptions from a wave of pro-democracy protests in the Middle East and North Africa have driven up the price of oil and other commodities, sparking inflation fears. U.S. crude is trading above $110 a barrel, and the average price of gasoline stands around $3.70 a gallon. But Lockhart said he expected commodity prices to stabilize and have a minimal effect on underlying U.S. inflation trends, even if costly fuel did put a dent on household budgets. \"With longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable -- and predicting that commodity price growth will stabilize -- my view is that current monetary policy is appropriate,\" Lockhart told the Knoxville Economics Club. Lockhart has argued recently the Fed should complete its $600 billion bond-buying stimulus program as scheduled by the end of June, saying there has not been enough compelling evidence to warrant a reversal. \"Historically, prices for industrial commodities have tended to exert a relatively small effect on most consumer prices,\" Lockhart said. \"This is not to say there will be no pass-through effect on inflation. The point is the effect is likely to be muted.\" In particular, he said there was little evidence of upward pressure on wages as the labor market continues to struggle. The European Central Bank raised official interest rates on Wednesday in a move that many saw as the opening salvo for a cycle of tightening. Still, the Fed is unlikely to follow suit in the near-term, as it continues to promise to keep rates at very low levels for an \"extended period.\" Lockhart said he did not see a major impact from the ECB's rate hike on the Fed's thinking. He said Fed officials were monitoring the European debt situation closely in the wake of Portugal's decision to request a eurozone bailout, but added that he does not expect major ripples for the United States. CONFIDENCE-BUSTER Lockhart said he remained worried about the housing sector, which has been showing signs of further deterioration in recent months. He said this slump was weighing on consumer confidence, countering some of the positive effects of an improving labor market outlook. Lockhart credited a strong rebound in manufacturing for a good deal of the economic recovery's underlying strength. \"Consumer confidence and spending have been weaker than many were expecting,\" he said. \"On the positive side, the labor market has improved in recent months, and the industrial activity data remain very strong.\" Given the still-fragile nature of the recovery, Lockhart said Fed officials should avoid discussing their exit strategy in too great a detail, lest they send the wrong signal to the public and financial markets about the direction of rates. In response to the deepest recession in generations, the Fed not only slashed interest rates to near zero but also committed to buy more than $2 trillion in government bonds and mortgage debt. U.S. gross domestic product expanded 3.1 percent at an annual clip in the fourth quarter, not as strong a rebound as is normally seen after a steep downturn. (Editing by  Neil Stempleman )\n",

      " SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - From Kuala Lumpur to Atlanta, Brent crude is gaining momentum as the global oil pricing reference of choice for producers and consumers, bolstering the Intercontinental Exchange in a battle of benchmarks for the world's most widely traded commodity. \n",
      "\n",
      " Three months after a blowout in the premium for ICE's European Brent crude futures over the New York Mercantile Exchange's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract stoked speculation about a shift in liquidity, changes in the way companies hedge have emerged in both the East and the West. Malaysia's Petronas this week dropped national crude Tapis as the benchmark for its exports in favor of ICE-related dated Brent. The move dealt a blow to the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), part owned by NYMEX, which has pushed its Oman crude contract as a replacement. Two weeks earlier, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines announced it had swapped out its previous jet fuel hedges based on the WTI contract in favor of Brent, which has more closely reflected global gasoline and jet fuel price moves than the U.S. marker. Trading volume -- a measure of a contract's health and liquidity -- tilted toward Brent, although the trend was masked by a slowdown in activity at the end of the first quarter. In the past 20 days, daily turnover in NYMEX crude futures exceeded that of ICE Brent futures by about 165,000 lots, the lowest figure since 2006. On Tuesday, ICE Brent traded more than NYMEX for only the ninth time since 2004, according to Reuters data from the exchanges. If more Asian producers opt to swap the region's current benchmarks -- mostly viewed as dysfunctional -- for Brent, the balance in the war for benchmark supremacy could swing more in ICE's favor. \"It seems to be part of a trend,\" said Mike Wittner, Americas head of commodities research at Societe Generale. \"More and more physical oil market participants, whether they are producers, consumers or refiners, are looking at Brent as perhaps more appropriate to manage their risk.\" TWO-TIERED MARKET It is too early to say whether volumes have been permanently sapped from WTI. In January and February, as global traders hit the panic button over unrest and war in Libya, WTI had some of its best days ever, several times exceeding Brent volume by more than 500,000 lots. But that changed dramatically as the quarter wound down. \"We have seen Brent volumes surge in the past and even exceed WTI from time to time, only to slip back again,\" said Olivier Jakob, managing director of consultants Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland. \"There has been a lot of debate about which contract is more representative of the international oil market and that will continue.\" WTI has sunk to record discounts against Brent, fuelling a discussion on whether Brent better reflects global fundamentals and the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa. Brent was trading around a 32-month high above $124 on Friday, with WTI around $112. At the beginning of March, NYMEX started offering traders the ability to hedge U.S. oil product futures RBOB gasoline and heating oil against Brent on its exchange. Some say the strategic glut in landlocked U.S. crude has caused the NYMEX market to lose its link with global fundamentals. The disruption in Libyan exports as the country fights a civil war has clearly affected Brent most heavily. But the long-term cause for Brent's ascent is perhaps further east, where soaring demand from Asia is lifting requirements of Middle East, Mediterranean and West African crude, mostly priced in relation to the European marker. Investors are helping Brent consolidate as a cross-continent marker for at least 70 percent of internationally traded crude because the structure of the ICE forward curve yields positive returns when rolling over positions every month, while for WTI the roll-over comes at a loss. \"Recently, one of the smartest ideas to enhance index return was to switch WTI for Brent,\" Goldman Sachs managing director for fixed income, currency and commodities Arun Assumall told Reuters in Singapore. \"Many investors would prefer to be exposed to a more global oil price, such as Brent.\" THE ASIAN GAME Malaysia's move to Brent may prompt other Asian producers to follow, including Vietnam and Indonesia, entrenching Brent's influence in the region and dampening efforts by the DME to draw Middle Eastern producers toward its Oman futures and away from Platts' Dubai/Oman assessments. Still, Malaysia's crude is light and sweet, while much of the exports from the Middle East which the DME is eyeing are heavier and more sour. That may mean there is enough space for different markers to gain ground for the different grades. Brent is gaining favor as a benchmark for sweet crude in Southeast Asia, but how attractive it would be to price sour Middle East grades is another matter, said John Vautrain, director at Purvin & Gertz energy consultants in Singapore. Malaysia's move to Brent \"illustrates the need and importance of reviewing pricing mechanisms used in East of Suez markets,\" the DME said in response to e-mailed questions. \"The current Dubai price assessment used for the majority of Middle Eastern crude exports into Asia suffers from a number of similar problems as Tapis as a benchmark,\" the DME said. The Dubai-based exchange said its Oman contract was the \"most appropriate\" marker. The wave of unrest sweeping the Middle East this year also raises new challenges for Oman as concerns grow the country's oil output may be disrupted. Pricing agency Platts is accelerating talks with customers to find alternative crudes for delivery against its Oman benchmark, used to price more than 10 million barrels per day. \"Any event that adds urgency may play against the efforts of Oman proponents by providing them less time and a more stressful environment in which to make their case,\" said Vautrain.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The official who carried out the last government shutdown has a warning for squabbling lawmakers -- another one now could be disastrous for the economy. \n",
      "\n",
      " John Koskinen, who organized federal operations during two government shutdowns in 1995, said failure by Republican and Democratic lawmakers to reach a budget deal could plunge the United States back into recession. \"Things are very different today than they were in 1995,\" Koskinen, a former deputy director at the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Reuters. \"In 1995, we had a budget deficit of $200 billion, which these days looks like a rounding error. The world then was relatively peaceful -- today we are involved in three wars. The economy today is extremely fragile. We have just gone through the biggest economic challenge in 80 years. In 1995 the economy was beginning to stabilize. \"A government shutdown will take up to a million workers -- government workers and contractors -- out of the economy. Another recession is a real possibility,'\" he said. Investment firm Goldman Sachs estimated a government shutdown lasting more than a week could cost the economy $8 billion in missed federal spending, dragging down growth. In 1995, the first shutdown lasted one week, around Thanksgiving. The other saw a three-week closure that finally ended when Congress reached a budget deal on the first Saturday in January 1996. NO PLAN Koskinen said there had never been a widespread government shutdown before 1995, and no government agency had a plan on how to manage one. During the summer of 1995, with a shutdown looming, Koskinen asked each government agency to supply a shutdown blueprint, including a list of which workers were deemed essential and nonessential. \"It was my idea,\" Koskinen said, \"but it was Justice Department language.\" He said there were unforeseen consequences in 1995, and lessons learned. For example, it is illegal for government workers to show up at work if they are not being paid. But many still showed up for duty. \"We had to bolt doors,\" Koskinen said. If there is a shutdown this time, he said, \"I think employees are much more aware now that they cannot work. But with the Internet and BlackBerry use today, I am sure some will try and work from home. That is why there is talk of people being forced to hand in their BlackBerrys.\" Koskinen said the procedure to shut government agencies almost takes care of itself. While the federal government can borrow money and run up huge deficits to fund itself, it is a crime for a federal agency to spend one cent more than the money Congress has appropriated for it. Each federal agency has a bank account to pay its staff and fund its duties. Once that bank account is empty, \"in layman's terms, you cannot overdraw that account. It is a crime.\" Koskinen said in 1995 the Internet was in its infancy. Today, most people rely on websites to get their information about the government. \"People will assume this information will be still be available if there is a shutdown this time round. It won't. These websites will close down.\" (Editing by  Vicki Allen )\n",

      " The New York-based investment bank priced 20.6 million shares at $24.25 each, a 3.5 percent discount to its closing price on Wednesday. Jefferies said late Thursday afternoon that it planned to raise $500 million in the offering. The $490 million in proceeds was net of underwriting fees. Jefferies also said on Friday that it plans to issue senior notes. The company did not say how much capital it intends to raise through that offering or whether it will retire other existing debt, which some analysts consider expensive. Jefferies is preparing to purchase a large trading operation from Prudential Financial Inc ( PRU.N ). The company said it will pay $430 million for the business, to be called Jefferies Bache, which trades commodities and derivatives on and off exchanges. After the deal was announced on Thursday, Jefferies shares came under pressure, dropping as much as 2.9 percent and finishing down 1.6 percent at $24.71. The shares were off 0.7 percent at $24.55 Friday morning. Ticonderoga Securities analyst Douglas Sipkin estimates the equity raise and acquisition will dilute Jefferies shareholders' stakes by 1 percent to 7 percent, depending on the earnings Bache can deliver. Bache reported pretax earnings of $17 million in 2010 on revenue of $220 million. Though Sipkin expects Jefferies shares to remain under pressure in the near term, he thinks the equity raise is a good move because it delevers Jefferies' balance sheet and increases book value. Gimme Credit analyst Kathleen Shanley has pointed out that Jefferies' balance sheet is more leveraged than that of larger rivals such as Goldman Sachs Inc ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and that its long-term debt is more expensive. A Jefferies spokesman contacted by Reuters did not immediately provide more information about the stock and bond offerings. Jefferies, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Natixis Bleichroeder LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc were the joint bookrunners for the stock offering, while BNY Mellon Capital Markets LLC and BMO Capital Markets Corp acted as senior co-managers and Rabo Securities USA Inc acted as co-manager.

A call for comment to Gruss' last listed employer Babcock & Brown was not immediately returned. Zwirn was a global hedge fund that managed $5 billion at its peak, the suit said, with over 200 employees in 10 offices across the world. It shut down its two largest offerings in 2008 after investors asked for roughly $2 billion back. It was later acquired by Fortress Management, a New York private equity and hedge fund manager. Gruss would approve all cash transfers at the company, the suit said. and would improperly transfer money between accounts to meet constant cash shortages.

      " CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The end of super-cheap money from the Federal Reserve is trumping corporate earnings results as a key risk to hedge for stock investors. \n",
      "\n",
      " Investors are looking forward to fewer price gyrations during this earnings season but are worried about how withdrawal of the Fed's extraordinary monetary support, expected in June, will affect shares. Normally the earnings reporting period is prone to ups and downs, but strong profit growth should keep volatility subdued. That's lessened the cost of hedging risk, and some investors have identified the end of the Fed's quantitative easing effort as something to hedge against. Some are willing to pay more to protect against declines a couple months down the road. \"It looks like all the markets from equities to currencies are pricing in some sort of the continuation of the Fed's quantitative easing policies,\" said Joe Cusick, senior market analyst at Chicago-based brokerage firm optionsXpress. \"While that gets debated between now and June, we are going to see some potential for renewed short-term volatility,\" Cusick said. Aluminum maker Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) will unofficially kick off the U.S. earnings season next Monday. Profit reports are expected to support U.S. stocks with first-quarter S&P 500 earnings are expected to show 11.5 percent year-over-year growth, according to Thomson Reuters. Investors will be scrutinizing early reports to get a clue of the sentiment for future earnings guidance and the economic landscape for the last two quarters of the year. \"The prospect of good earnings in a period of still-low interest rates is supporting equities, even as the European debt crisis, higher crude oil prices, and other events overseas add some earnings risk longer-term,\" said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a barometer of investor anxiety known as the VIX .VIX, is at relatively low levels. It also indicates S&P 500 index  .SPX  options are getting cheaper in the near term. The 10-day historical volatility for the SPX dropped below 7 percent on Thursday, a sign of very calm markets, compared to 19 percent two weeks ago. The VIX was lately trading at around the 17 level, after rising to 31.28 on March 16 in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake crisis. With the stock market near two-and-a-half year highs, in-line earnings may not be rewarded as they have been in past earnings cycles and could lead to disappointment. Still, the expectation of gradual tightening of Fed policy is potentially more worrying. The Fed is in the middle of a $600 billion bond-buying program that has been credited with helping to underpin the stock market's rally. Investors are starting to buy protection against future headline risk as a result. VIX futures are pricing in some fear in the back months. Contracts from June to November expect the VIX to rise to above a 21 to 24 reading in the second half of the year. \"Near-term options as measured by the VIX are getting less expensive but we see buying demand for further out-of-the money puts in the SPX as a hedging tool,\" said Chris McKhann, an analyst at stock and options website optionMonster.com. This is also reflected in the CBOE SKEW Index, .SKEWX which measures demand for out-of-the-money puts compared to out-of-the-money calls, McKhann said. The greater the skew, the more investors are willing to pay for the out-of-the-money protective put positions than the upside call positions. \"This means those seeking protection for the downside in equities are likely best served by buying near-term at-the-money put options, which are relatively cheap and selling out-of-the-money puts--taking advantage of that skew,\" McKhann said.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell late on Friday as a spike in oil prices revived worries that inflation would derail the recovery, jolting a market that had been treading water ahead of corporate earnings. \n",
      "\n",
      " The uncertain outcome of budget talks in Washington and the prospect of a U.S. government shutdown as a midnight deadline loomed spurred investors to buy protection ahead of the weekend. Many traders bought short-term put options on the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ( SPY.P ). \"The tape is heading south in light volume. People are hoping that nothing bad happens over the weekend,\" said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The surge in oil prices drove down shares of airlines and transportation companies. The Arca Airline index  .XAL  shed 2.7 percent and the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT fell 1.7 percent. Brent crude futures settled above $126 a barrel, the highest level in 32 months, as the weak dollar drove up commodities and intense fighting in Libya raised fears of prolonged supply cuts. Trading volumes remained low, a sign that investors are holding off major new bets ahead of the release of quarterly earnings beginning next week. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 29.59 points, or 0.24 percent, at 12,379.90. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 5.36 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,328.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 15.73 points, or 0.56 percent, at 2,780.41. For the week, the Dow rose 0.03 percent while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each lost 0.3 percent. Trading volume was 6.47 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, compared with last year's estimated daily average of 8.47 billion. The S&P faces resistance around 1,345, near its 2011 high. Many analysts believe earnings could be the catalyst that pushes the benchmark index through that resistance. \"If the earnings next week are robust enough, we might go above 1,350, which is the top of the trading range. But since the market is very complacent, we might easily turn the other way if we see a negative outlook,\" said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. The earnings season will begin unofficially when Dow component Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) reports results after the market's close on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) are due to report later in the week. Bullishness has risen to levels not seen since last December before earnings, according to a survey by Investors Intelligence. Bucking the downtrend on Friday, commodity-related shares rose with higher oil and metals prices. Occidental Petroleum Corp ( OXY.N ) rose 2.6 percent to $103.72 and the S&P Energy index .GSPE was up 0.4 percent. Copper rose 2.5 percent while gold hit record highs on Friday and silver reached its strongest level since early 1980, as investors snapped up inflation-sensitive raw materials as a hedge. U.S.-listed shares of miner Rio Tinto Plc ( RIO.N ) rose 2.1 percent. The White House and Congress faced a midnight deadline to break a budget deadlock. Democratic and Republican leaders said there was still no overall deal on government funding for the rest of the fiscal year.

      " HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) has bought a 12 percent stake worth more than $900 million in China's Taikang Life Insurance Co Ltd, giving the Wall Street giant a foothold into the world's biggest insurance market. \n",
      "\n",
      " Goldman's long-overdue purchase could pave the way for Taikang's planned initial public offering next year, bankers and analysts said, as the insurer seeks more capital to fund its rapid growth in China. Credit Suisse estimates China's life insurance market --which generated $124 billion premium income in 2009 -- will grow more than 20 percent per annum for the next decade. But some analysts doubt if Goldman can earn the same big returns that Carlyle Group CYL.UL and TPG Capital TPG.UL reaped from their investments in Chinese insurance companies. \"Goldman has come in pretty late into the game relative to Taikang's planned IPO timeline, so the returns might not be as high as previous investors have got,\" said Sally Yim, senior analyst of financial institutions group at Moody's. Carlyle's investment in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co ( 2601.HK ) is already on course for its best ever exit, after it sold down a $2.6 billion stake over the past few months. Last year, TPG sold a $2.4 billion stake in China's Ping An Insurance Group Co ( 2318.HK ), which analysts estimate delivered strong profits for the buyout fund. RIVAL BIDDERS Goldman is not new to the China insurance industry, having previously bought a stake in Ping An along with Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) in 1994. But Goldman is using its balance sheet to buy the Taikang stake, while the previous investment was made through its private equity arm. Goldman acquired the Taikang stake from French insurer AXA SA ( AXAF.PA ), which last month said it agreed to sell its 15.6 percent in Taikang to a group of investors for $1.2 billion. Goldman beat several bidders, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co ( KKR.N ), Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) and Singapore's Temasek Holdings TEM.UL, to win the Taikang auction. China Guardian Auctions Co. and New Deal TEDA Investment Co., Ltd were the others who bought the shares sold by AXA, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said on its web site. AXA put its stake on the block nearly two years ago and Goldman was picked as the preferred bidder last year. The stake purchase was approved by CIRC, Goldman and Taikang said in a joint statement. Taikang and New China Life Insurance Co. are among insurers which are looking to tap the public market over the course of the next year or so. Taikang has about $44 billion in assets and 54 million clients across China. \"The regulators are a bit reluctant to allow insurance companies to raise subordinate debt to replenish capital. So all these companies are looking to shareholders to help inject capital to support growth,\" Yim of Moody's added. (Editing by  Michael Flaherty  and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n",

      " In a filing on Thursday, the U.S. Trustee's Office said the plan to pay 17 executives, 25 \"director-level\" employees and additional \"key\" employees over $8 million in bonuses was \"really a disguised retention plan for insiders, which also provides for discriminatory bonuses for non-insiders\". The Trustee's Office, which is the Justice Department agency charged with overseeing the administration of bankruptcy cases, said Borders failed to show that the proposed payments complied with the bankruptcy code. \"Seeking the approval of the bonus motion at this early juncture, prior to the debtors finalizing their business and operational plans is not a sound exercise of the debtors' business judgment,\" said Tracy Hope Davis, the U.S. Trustee, in the filing. The book retailer filed for bankruptcy protection in February and said it would close 200 stores, after years of shriveling sales made its debt load impossible to manage. It said at the time that 6,000 jobs would be affected. The company defended its proposal on Friday, saying it was designed to retain key executives during the reorganization process and noted that nothing would be paid out unless certain targets were met. It also said it was working to address the questions that were raised. \"Borders has made significant progress during the first six weeks of its reorganization. Retaining key executives is essential to continuing the progress underway for the benefit of all of the company's stakeholders,\" said spokeswoman Mary Davis in an emailed statement.

      " DALLAS/KNOXVILLE, Tennessee  (Reuters) - Dueling views on the outlook for inflation and U.S. monetary policy by two top Federal Reserve officials on Friday underscored divisions at the central bank as it nears the end of a controversial stimulus program. \n",
      "\n",
      " In comments that reflect the majority view at the Fed -- including Chairman Ben Bernanke -- Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said it was unlikely that recent spikes in commodity costs will lead to runaway increases in prices. \"With longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable -- and predicting that commodity price growth will stabilize -- my view is that current monetary policy is appropriate,\" Lockhart told the Knoxville Economics Club in Tennessee. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed and a self-proclaimed inflation hawk, took a divergent view, saying that prolonged easy monetary policy could compound what might otherwise be transitory inflationary pressures. Warning of \"unpleasant\" U.S. inflation data ahead, Fisher called on the U.S. central bank to stop \"spiking the punch bowl\" with more accommodative policy and said the Fed may even need to end its $600 billion bond-buying program early. \"No amount of further accommodation by the Fed would be wise,\" he told the Society of American Business Editors and Writers in Dallas. \"Indeed, it may well be that we should consider curtailing what remains of QE2,\" he said, referring to the Fed's second round of quantitative easing, which is slated to end in June. The prices of oil and other commodities have spiked, sparking inflation fears, hit by both strong demand from rapidly growing emerging economies and fears of supply disruptions amid a wave of pro-democracy protests in the Middle East and North Africa. U.S. crude has been trading at the highest prices since September 2008, rising above $110 a barrel, and the average price of gasoline stands around $3.70 a gallon. But Lockhart said that while costly fuel is putting a dent in household budgets, the overall effect on inflation is likely to be muted. In part that's because high unemployment -- at 8.8 percent in March -- is keeping wage-driven inflation under wraps, he said. Conceding that point as \"reasonable,\" Fisher -- who holds a voting seat this year on the Fed's policy-setting panel -- nevertheless said the Fed should not compound the risk of fueling inflation by adding more liquidity. Several other hawkish Fed policy makers have pushed noisily in recent weeks for the central bank to heed signs of incipient inflation and to begin to think about raising rates, as the European Central Bank did on Thursday for the first time since 2008. But Bernanke and other core members of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee have said the recovery is too fragile to withdraw support yet. Given the still-fragile nature of the recovery, Lockhart said Fed officials should avoid discussing their exit strategy in too great detail, lest they send the wrong signal to the public and financial markets about the direction of interest rates. In response to the deepest recession in generations, the Fed slashed interest rates to near zero and also committed to buy more than $2 trillion in government bonds and mortgage debt. U.S. gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent the fourth quarter, a rebound which is less robust than normally seen after a steep downturn.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Here's some advice for anyone hoping not to get caught in an insider trading web: Shut up. \n",
      "\n",
      " After the October 2009 arrest of Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, who was wiretapped by the FBI, the world woke to a new era of prosecutorial tactics in insider trading probes. For those considering crossing the line, the changes may make insider trading seem a vocation not worth the risk. Emails and other forms of electronic communication can be traced. Destroying old-fashioned snail mail or hard drives will not work if the government gets a tip it is being done. And don't talk to people. There is no certainty that what is said will remain private. Indeed, recent phone recordings make some accused wrongdoers come across as Keystone Kriminals. \"Insider trading today is a lot more difficult to get away with than it was 20 years ago,\" said Andrew Stoltmann, a principal at Stoltmann Law Offices PC in Chicago who has handled civil insider trading cases. \"Prosecutors really are cracking down. And there are electronic trails left behind.\" GARBAGE CANS AND GARBAGE TRUCKS A recent proliferation of cases against fund managers, traders and lawyers shows a new aggression, especially in the use of wiretaps and recorded phone calls to build cases. The latest illustration: this week's arrests of lawyer Matthew Kluger and trader Garrett Bauer. Prosecutors say the men ran a 17-year conspiracy tied to tips on mergers that Kluger stole while working at high-octane law firms. They have yet to enter pleas in the case. Twelve single-spaced pages of a criminal complaint detail nervous calls that Kluger or Bauer had with an unnamed co-conspirator, once they thought the government was on their tails. \"I got rid of my computer,\" Kluger was recorded as saying on March 17. \"I got rid of my iPhone where I had looked up some stock quotes. Those are gone. I mean history. Gone.\" Bauer was recorded a day later as needing more effort to dump his prepaid cellphone. \"I broke the phone in half and went to McDonald's and put it in two different garbage cans,\" he said, according to the complaint. \"Someone was watching me. I thought it was an FBI agent. And I asked him, 'Do you know me? You look familiar.'\" Prosecutors say hedge fund manager Donald Longueuil, a defendant in another insider trading case, used a similar modus operandi. They contend he once took to the streets of Manhattan at 2 a.m. to find places to toss a flash drive and two hard drives that had incriminating evidence. \"I go on like a 20-block walk,\" he said in a recorded conversation. \"And threw the shit in the back of like random garbage trucks, different garbage trucks ... four different garbage trucks.\" Then there were Bonnie and Yonni -- former Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) assistant Bonnie Hoxie and her boyfriend Yonni Sebbag. Last year, Sebbag tried to sell Disney secrets that Hoxie learned at her job to some 30 hedge funds and other investors. Prosecutors said he used a FedEx Kinko's computer for the deed. Bad idea. Google found the computer, and several funds went to the authorities. Both defendants admitted their guilt. Sebbag was sentenced to 27 months in prison. Hoxie got probation. CANADA TOO Two years ago, Canadian prosecutors said lawyer Gil Cornblum and his friend Stanko Grmovsek relied on pay phones for several years as part of a 14-year insider trading conspiracy based on secrets Cornblum learned at his job. Cornblum committed suicide by jumping from a Toronto bridge in October 2009, a day before Grmovsek pleaded guilty. Prosecutors say Rajaratnam, a one-time billionaire, also tried to cover his tracks. Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty. He is set to begin his defense next week in Manhattan federal court, in Wall Street's bigger insider trading case since the prosecutions of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken more than two decades ago. Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey & Co consultant arrested with Rajaratnam and now cooperating with the government, last month testified to having lolled with his longtime friend in a pair of deck chairs in Miami Beach, just prior to their arrests. \"You know, Anil, I'm told there's a gentleman who used to work for me and he's now wearing a wire,\" Kumar recalled Rajaratnam as saying. \"You should be careful,\" Kumar said he responded. \"You should make prepaid phone calls to me.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by John Wallace)\n"

Sales at wholesalers fell 0.8 percent, the largest drop since March 2009, after rising by a downwardly revised 3.3 percent in January. The decline in sales was the first since June 2009 and suggested that retailers were anticipating a slowdown in demand from consumers. Analysts had expected sales at wholesalers to rise 1.8 percent in February after a previously reported 3.5 percent surge in January.

From March 11 to April 25, Toyota estimates that it will produce 35,000 fewer vehicles in North America than previously estimated, Toyota spokesman Mike Goss said. The company has not made any decisions about North American production beyond April 25. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)\n",

      " CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Investors looking for loan growth and surging revenues at the biggest U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) are likely to be disappointed by first-quarter earnings. \n",
      "\n",
      " Banks have been generating most of their profits in recent quarters from dipping into money they previously set aside to cover bad loans. Those reserve reductions make sense if credit losses are stabilizing, which seems to be the case. But banks cannot reduce their loan loss reserves forever and at this point profit growth must come from making more money from loans and generating more fees, analysts said. Boosting interest income from loans is tough when the interest rates at which banks lend are so low and loan demand is still tepid. Fee income, meanwhile, is being threatened by future regulatory changes. \"The revenue line will be key, that's what most investors will be focusing on,\" said Jason Ware, senior equities analyst at Albion Financial Group. The Salt Lake City-based wealth manager oversees $650 million in client assets. \"The question everyone has is 'Where does the top line go from here?'\" he said. Some banks will be particularly hard hit by weak trading in the quarter, as the stock market sagged on Middle Eastern political upheaval, a Japanese earthquake and tsunami sent the yen to record highs and markets were broadly unpredictable. But what many analysts are focusing on now is loan growth and data show the results may not be great. Bank loans outstanding declined 0.9 percent in January and 6.8 percent in February, according to a report from the Federal Reserve. Commercial and industrial loans were on the rise, which many analysts see as a positive sign, but meanwhile a broad array of consumer loans -- mortgages, credit cards -- are posting declines, so total bank credit outstanding are shrinking. The first quarter, analysts said, is typically the weakest of the year for banks. But the analysts with the best track records foresee a quarter that was tougher than usual for many banks, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine Smart Estimates. These \"smart analysts\" believe other analysts are far too optimistic about some banks, and only a little too pessimistic about the others. The analysts that have historically been the most accurate believe that results for Citigroup, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) will fall short of analysts' average estimates, according to Starmine Smart Estimates. Starmine's analyst estimates, for example, indicates Morgan Stanley may miss estimates by as much as 22 percent. The Starmine \"smart analysts\" are projecting that Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) will beat broader estimates by a fairly small margin. BofA is projected with the largest earnings beat at 7.7 percent above the average estimate, Starmine estimates. NEW NORMAL For even the largest U.S. banks, interest income from loans is a key driver of earnings growth, but the total number of outstanding loans continues to stagnate, even as banks appear to have solved many of the credit issues that have dogged them for the last three years. The fees that banks get from processing debit cards will likely be limited by provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, which will pressure fee income for banks in the future. Marty Mosby, bank analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said he is expecting banks will show a 10 percent decline in total charge-offs of bad loans, with some showing charge-offs shrinking by as much as 50 percent. While that will be a boost to earnings as banks continue to release reserves protecting against loan losses, Mosby said he does not expect loan growth for the next few quarters. \"This will be a different model than what we're used to seeing, based more on profitability, consolidation and efficiency, rather than outright organic growth,\" Mosby said. In the fourth quarter of 2010, loans at U.S. banks totaled $7.38 trillion, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2009 and off from the peak of $8 trillion in the second quarter of 2008, FDIC data show. Long term, investors may need to adjust their expectations for the industry's earning ability. Mosby said banks that were once able to produce a 20 percent return on shareholder equity may not be able to top 15 percent. Bank's return on equity could dip to as low or 10 or 12 percent, he added. Halle Benett, a banker in charge of financial institutions merger advisory at UBS for the Americas, said: \"I do think you've got to come to a decision as to what is generally accepted profitability for banking institutions and I'm not sure the cycle we came out of was the long-term norm.\" (Reporting by Joe Rauch; Additional reporting by  Clare Baldwin  and Lauren LaCapra in New York; Editing by  Gary Hill )\n",

      " Total wholesale inventories increased 1.0 percent to $437.99 billion, the highest level since December 2008, the Commerce Department said, following an unrevised 1.0 percent rise in January. Economists polled by Reuters had expected stocks of unsold goods at U.S. wholesalers to rise 1.0 percent in February. Sales at wholesalers fell 0.8 percent, the largest drop since March 2009, after rising by a downwardly revised 3.3 percent in January. The decline in sales was the first since June 2009 and suggested that retailers were anticipating a slowdown in demand from consumers. Consumer spending got off to a slow start in the first two months of 2011 after a brisk pace in the fourth quarter, held back by bad weather and rising gasoline prices. Analysts had expected sales at wholesalers to rise 1.8 percent in February after a previously reported 3.5 percent surge in January. Sales at wholesalers in February were weak almost across the board, although groceries saw their biggest increase since January 1997. Petroleum sales fell 1.0 percent, but stocks rose 9.3 percent-- the largest since June 2008. The weak sales pace raised the inventory-to-sales-ratio, which measures how long it would take to clear shelves at the current sales pace, to 1.16 months from 1.14 months in January.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices surged the most in three weeks on Friday, with Brent jumping $4 a barrel to a 32-month high as a sinking dollar triggered a fresh rush of fund buying across the commodities spectrum. \n",
      "\n",
      " U.S. crude topped $113 but trailed Brent, which closed out its best weekly gain since February. Deepening violence in Libya and concerns about unrest in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria lent new impetus to a rally that is threatening to crimp global growth and add to growing inflation concerns. Analysts said Friday's sharp gains in oil, wheat, copper and gold -- while stocks slipped -- stemmed from a big wave of second-quarter investment. Oil drew extra support from fears that the war in Libya was starting to inflict lasting damage on the oil sector. \"Troubles in Libya mean Gaddafi has caused damage to the Sirte basin, which has about two-thirds of their oil. There's dollar weakness and some very large fund action piling into the market in oil and base metals,\" said Rob Montefusco, an oil trader at Sucden Financial. ICE Brent crude for May rose $3.98 to settle at $126.65 a barrel, highest settlement since July 2008. It reached $126.91 in post-settlement trading. U.S. crude rose $2.49 to settle at $112.79. It reached $113.20 post-settlement, the highest intraday price since September 2008. DOLLAR WEAKENS The dollar index .DXY measuring the greenback against a basket of currencies weakened as the euro jumped to a 15-month peak against the dollar following the European Central Bank's interest rate hike. <USD/> A weaker dollar often lifts dollar-denominated commodities because they become attractive as a hard-asset inflation hedge and demand can be stoked by cheaper prices for consumers using other currencies. \"New investment flows at the start of the quarter are driving oil and gold this morning, with the strong rise over the past week attracting trend followers and more fund money,\" said Michael Guido, director of hedge fund energy sales at Macquarie Bank in New York. \"The uptrend is still very much intact, with key technical levels being taken out.\" Brent's 14-day Relative Strength Index, a technicians' measure to gauge whether a contract is overbought or oversold, approached 80 -- a level only hit three times before and never surpassed, according to Reuters data. U.S. crude trading volumes above 600,000 lots neared the 30-day average, rebounding from late March when activity hit the lowest this year. AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST TURMOIL In addition to the Libyan conflict, investors eyed protests in top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and unrest in Syria, Yemen and attacks intended to interfere with elections in OPEC-member Nigeria, which produces 1.9 million barrels per day of oil. Libya's civil war has cut the normal output of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) by 80 percent to between 250,000 and 300,000 bpd, according to a senior government official. NATO leaders have acknowledged the limits of their air power, with analysts predicting a drawn-out conflict.

      " The steps under consideration would help privately held companies like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Zynga Inc to raise more money without going through increased reporting and other requirements of becoming a public company, the report said. Currently, companies can issue shares privately without incurring onerous reporting obligations if they have fewer than 500 shareholders. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering raising that limit, though it is unclear by how much, the Journal said. The move could potentially delay or derail initial public offerings by technology companies that want to grow but would rather avoid having to disclose vast amounts of information, the report said citing an SEC letter to a lawmaker. It could also shut out many ordinary investors from one of the fastest-growing market sectors, since shares in private companies are generally available only to investors whose individual net worth is at least $1 million. The SEC could not be reached for comment outside of business hours. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)\n",

      " (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ) said increased demand in domestic ground shipments lifted profits in the third quarter and expects online sales to boost shipping volumes as it heads into the holiday quarter. \n",
      " Shares in the courier company rose 2 percent on Friday before the markets opened. UPS, which delivered more than one billion packages worldwide during the quarter, also reconfirmed its profit view for the year. Shipment volume and forecasts at UPS, along with rival FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ), are closely watched by Wall Street and considered an indication of overall economic health because of the vast amount of goods they transport. For this year's holiday season, UPS said it expects peak season daily volume to increase by 8 percent, with pick-up volumes for Cyber Monday increasing 10 percent. Earlier in the week, rival FedEx forecast an 11 percent rise for the same day, the Monday after Thanksgiving that is traditionally a big day for online holiday sales. For the third quarter, UPS said daily ground shipping volumes rose 3 percent, while next-day shipping fell 3.3 percent. Clients have been trading down from pricey next-day air deliveries to more affordable shipping ways that take more time, to save money. Also, manufacturers and retailers have become more savvy with their supply chains, planning shipments strategically to cut back on express shipping. This reduces costs for manufacturers, but hurts courier companies like UPS, which make more money on faster shipping. UPS said some shippers have moved their distribution facilities closer to their customers, which slowed air shipment growth but led to a greater use of UPS Ground facilities. For the third quarter, the Atlanta-based company earned $1.10 billion, or $1.16 a share, compared with $469 million or 48 cents a share a year earlier. The company expects earnings of between $4.65 and $4.85 per share for the current year. Revenue came in at $13.52 billion, up 3.4 percent over last year, mainly helped by U.S. e-commerce shipments and strong European export growth. Analysts, on average, were expecting the company to earn $1.15 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company were trading at $96.54 Friday morning before the bell. They closed at $94.49 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

      " (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) reached a deal on Friday to resolve a lawsuit in the United States over unintended acceleration issues, one day after a jury found the Japanese carmaker liable and ordered it to pay $3 million for defects that caused a 2007 fatal crash. \n",
      " A jury in Oklahoma on Thursday ordered the company to pay $3 million in compensatory damages to Jean Bookout, a driver injured in the 2007 crash, and the family of Barbara Schwarz, who was killed. Jurors were scheduled to resume deliberating on Friday on whether to award punitive damages against Toyota. Before the jury could reach a decision, Toyota and lawyers for the plaintiffs announced they had reached a confidential settlement to resolve the case. The lawsuit is one of the first involving acceleration issues to go to trial since similar concerns prompted Toyota to begin in 2009 to recall millions of vehicles. The lawsuit alleged that software defects in the electronic throttle control system of Bookout's 2005 Camry caused it to speed out of control and crash, killing Schwarz. \"While we strongly disagree with the verdict, we are satisfied that the parties reached a mutually acceptable agreement to settle this case,\" Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said in a statement. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, J. Cole Portis, said they were pleased with the jury's decision. \"We are fully convinced that Toyota's conduct from the time the electronic throttle control system was designed has been shameful,\" Portis said in a statement. \"We appreciate that the jury had the courage to let Toyota and the public know that Toyota was reckless.\" The case is the first loss for Toyota in a string of early trials over acceleration issues, which prompted hundreds of lawsuits across the country in the wake of the recalls. The 2005 Camry at issue in the Oklahoma trial was not included in the recalls. Two earlier trials in Brooklyn, New York, and California, absolved Toyota of liability for alleged acceleration-related defects. There have been roughly 200 proposed class actions and more than 500 individual cases filed against Toyota since February 2009 over the alleged acceleration issues, according to a regulatory filing from the company. Toyota has already agreed to pay a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve claims for economic losses, such as repair costs or lowered resale value, over acceleration issues. That settlement did not cover personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits. (The story was corrected to make it clear in paragraph 3 that settlement resolves entire case.)

      " SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Seeking to avoid a repeat of Facebook Inc's much-maligned public debut, Twitter Inc revealed more modest ambitions, saying its initial offering would raise up to $1.6 billion and value the company at up to about $11 billion. \n",
      " The valuation was more conservative than the $15 billion some analysts had expected for the social media phenomenon, potentially attracting investors who might consider the money-losing company's listing price a better deal, with room to rise. Twitter had signaled for weeks it would price its IPO modestly to avoid the sort of stock plummet that spoiled Facebook's coming-out party. It said on Thursday it intends to sell 70 million shares between $17 and $20 apiece, raking in up to $1.4 billion for the company. If underwriters choose to sell an additional allotment of 10.5 million shares, the offer could raise as much as $1.6 billion. Twitter's offering will be the most high-profile Internet IPO since Facebook's May 2012 debut, when the social network giant's shares fell below their offering price and did not recover until a year later. Still, the modest pricing doesn't obscure questions about Twitter's profitability. \"The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop,\" said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Weath Management. \"But in the end, even for $11 billion, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that.\" At a roughly $11 billion valuation, Twitter would be worth more than Yelp Inc and AOL Inc combined, but only a fraction of tech giants like Google Inc and Apple Inc, worth $342 billion and $483 billion respectively. Facebook's market value is now $128 billion. ROADSHOW RECKONING Twitter and its underwriters begin a two-week road show to woo investors next Monday in New York, with stops in Boston and the mid-Atlantic region before touching down in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Denver, according to a source familiar with the offering. \"They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market,\" said Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser, who valued the company at $19 billion. The company could choose to raise the price of the offering during that period as it gauges interest. Twitter is expected to set a final price on November 6, according to a document reviewed by Reuters, suggesting that the stock could begin trading as early as November 7. Sam Hamadeh of PrivCo, a private company research firm, said Twitter could raise the price range and also the amount of shares being sold. But, he added: \"Raising both the price and the size was Facebook's fatal mistake.\" Twitter's debut will cap seven years of explosive growth for an online messaging service that counts heads of state and major celebrities among its 230 million active users - but still operates at a loss. Twitter will sell roughly 13 percent of the company in the IPO and will have 544,696,816 shares outstanding after the offering. That figure could rise given the exercising of options, restricted stock units and the issuance of shares for compensation after the IPO. The company plans to list its stock under the \"TWTR\" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. Among the biggest Twitter shareholders selling in the offering is Rizvi Traverse, a fund managed by secretive Connecticut-based investor Suhail Rizvi, who has quietly amassed a 17.9 percent stake in Twitter with the help of Silicon Valley investor Chris Sacca. Rizvi's stake will fall to 15.6 percent of total shares outstanding after the sale. JP Morgan Chase, which obtained Twitter shares through Rizvi and Sacca, will see its stake fall to 9 percent from 10.3 percent. Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, the largest individual shareholder, will reduce his stake to 10.4 percent from 12 percent, while Chief Executive Dick Costolo will emerge with a 1.4 percent stake, compared with 1.6 percent currently. Co-founder Jack Dorsey will also sell shares, as will early venture capital investors Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and Benchmark Capital. FRACTURED OWNERSHIP Because many early shareholders, including Williams, previously sold parts of their stake to other investors like Rizvi, Twitter's relatively fractured ownership structure looks markedly different from the likes of Facebook and other tech companies dominated by their founders. When Facebook went public last year, founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg kept 57 percent of the company's voting shares, thanks to a scheme that gave him twice the voting power of ordinary shareholders. Following Twitter's IPO, Costolo will be under pressure to improve its money-making ability. The eight-year-old company more than doubled its third-quarter revenue to $168.6 million, but net losses widened to $64.6 million in the September quarter, it disclosed in a filing earlier this month. This month, Twitter secured a $1 billion credit line from its underwriters including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. In recent months the company has aggressively introduced a number of new advertising products, including packages with broadcasters CBS and ESPN that show ads on TV and Twitter simultaneously for the fall TV season. Twitter has also sought to deepen its relationships with news organizations, which provide much of the content shared on the network. The company said Thursday that it hired NBC News digital executive Vivian Schiller as the head of news.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's economy picked up more speed between July and September, growing at its fastest pace in more than three years and building on an unexpected turnaround that has buoyed the government. \n",
      " Gross domestic product rose by 0.8 percent, faster than the 0.7 percent achieved in the April-June period, Britain's Office for National Statistics said on Friday. The quarterly growth and the year-on-year rate of 1.5 percent were in line with forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll. The numbers also made Britain, until recently a laggard among the world's rich countries, one of its fastest-growing economies with an annualized growth rate of over 3 percent. British government bond prices initially rose, reflecting expectations among some investors that quarterly growth might have been closer to 1 percent, but quickly fell back. The pound strengthened slightly against the dollar and the euro. Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said quarterly growth could have reached 0.9 percent but for weak gas and electricity output. That was possibly a reflection of Britain's unusually hot summer this year. Samuel Tombs, an economist with Capital Economics, said Britain's economy was unlikely to gather much more pace because of wages that are rising less than inflation, more government spending cuts and the dormant euro zone. \"But with employment growing, confidence returning and productivity still well below its potential, it seems unlikely that the recovery will fade significantly either,\" he said. Britain's economy has staged a surprising recovery since early 2013 when it avoided falling back into recession. The turnaround has given a boost to Conservative finance minister George Osborne, who defied calls from the International Monetary Fund and the opposition Labor Party to bring forward spending in order to get the economy off the ropes. The government hailed the growth figures as proof that its tough approach to public spending was paying off. \"Many risks remain, but thanks to our economic plan, the recovery now has real momentum,\" a Treasury spokesman said. STILL SMALLER The growth between July and September meant the British economy expanded for three successive quarters for the first time since 2011. Nonetheless, unlike almost all other developed economies, which have fully recovered output lost during the financial crisis, Britain's economy remains 2.5 percent smaller than its previous peak in early 2008. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney noted on Thursday that growth was coming from a low base, so Friday's figures are unlikely to sway policy at the bank, which has suggested it will keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5 percent for three more years. Earnings are lagging inflation, raising questions about the sustainability of the recovery and giving ammunition to Labor to attack the government in the run-up to a general election due in 2015. Friday's data showed Britain's giant services sector, which accounts for nearly 80 percent of the economy, expanded by 0.7 percent from the second quarter and was now above its peak before the financial crisis hammered Britain. Growth in services was driven by the private sector, while government services lagged behind, a reflection of Osborne's push to curb public spending. Manufacturing grew 0.9 percent, and construction, which has begun to recover after a sharp contraction caused by the crisis, expanded by 2.5 percent, the strongest in more than three years as house building picked up, the ONS said. Consumers, a key engine of Britain's economy, are feeling increasingly upbeat, a separate survey showed on Friday. A consumer confidence index compiled by market researchers YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research hit its highest level this month since it was launched in April 2009. The survey showed that expectations of higher house prices were driving the increase in confidence; homeowners expected their properties to be worth 2 percent more in 12 months' time, almost double the expected gain in July's survey. Critics of the government's economic policies say its attempts to revive the housing market will not help bring about the long-hoped-for rebalancing of Britain's economy towards more manufacturing and exports. The ONS's preliminary estimates of GDP are among the first released in the European Union, and are based partly on estimated data. On average, they are revised by 0.1 percentage points up or down by the time a second revision is published two months later, but bigger moves are not uncommon.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World equity indexes were near five-year highs on Friday as major U.S. technology companies propelled Wall Street to another day of gains, sending the S&P 500 index to close at a record. \n",
      " Reversing early weakness, the euro slightly rose against the dollar, hovering close to a two-year high, as souring German business morale did little to dent bullish sentiment toward the euro zone common currency. While equity markets in Europe and Asia were weaker, Wall Street extended its recent climb, helped by gains in technology shares after strong results from Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) and Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ). Microsoft shares ended up 6 percent at $35.73 while Amazon.com added 9.4 percent to $363.39. The S&P 500 has gained about 23.4 percent so far this year, just shy of its 23.5 percent jump in 2009. Surpassing that level would give the index its biggest annual gain in a decade. \"It seems like good news is being responded to very well and bad news is just seen as more evidence the Fed won't be able to tighten anytime soon,\" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The market has risen following last week's deal to avoid a U.S. debt default and end a partial government shutdown, as well as increased speculation the Federal Reserve will delay scaling back its stimulus for several months. The S&P 500 had hit record finishes for four sessions until Wednesday. MSCI's world share index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks 45 countries, was flat near a five-year high, erasing early weakness. Nikkei futures index fell 1.6 percent following news that a large earthquake struck in the ocean east of Japan, triggering a small tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage on land from the quake, classified as magnitude 7.1 by the Japan Meteorological Agency, which struck about 370 km (230 miles) out to sea. Japan's Nikkei stock average suffered its biggest one-day loss in 2-1/2 months on Friday, hit by the yen's strength against the dollar. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 61.07 points, or 0.39 percent, to 15,570.28, the S&P 500  .SPX  gained 7.71 points or 0.44 percent, to 1,759.78 and the Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  added 14.401 points or 0.37 percent, to 3,943.361. For the week, the Dow rose 1.1 percent, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq added 0.7 percent. European equities ended slightly lower on Friday, with Telecom Italia leading the telecoms sector down on concerns of a capital hike by the Italian company and Volvo hurting industrials after reporting a sharp drop in profits. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  closed 0.1 percent lower at 1,284.76, but for the week was up 0.6 percent for a third straight week of gains after hitting a five-year high on Tuesday. .EU In the currency market, the euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.3808, not far from an earlier peak of $1.3832, its highest since November 2011. Against the yen, the euro was up 0.2 percent at 134.48 yen. The dollar was flat against a basket of six major currencies at 79.178 .DXY, off a near nine-month low of 78.998. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose, with benchmark yields hovering near three-month lows, as investors shifted their focus to the Federal Reserve meeting next week, where it might signal it will stick to the current size of its bond-purchase stimulus. The bond market has traded in a tight range since Tuesday, when yields fell on data that showed employers hired fewer workers than expected in September, stoking fears the economy was slowing even before the government's 16-day shutdown. The 10-year note yield was on track to fall for a second straight week, though it has struggled to decline much below the chart resistance of 2.50 percent. After a choppy week for commodities markets, Brent crude for December settled down 6 cents at $106.93 a barrel while U.S. crude oil ended up 74 cents at $97.85.

      " (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc ( ABBV.N ) on Friday reported stronger-than-expected results for the third quarter, as booming sales of its Humira arthritis treatment and Synthroid thyroid replacement drug more than offset lower demand for other medicines. \n",
      " Shares of the drugmaker, which was split off at the beginning of the year from Abbott Laboratories Inc ( ABT.N ), rose 2.4 percent. Humira, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease and other conditions, is the world's top-selling prescription drug. Sales have risen steadily since it was introduced in 2002. The injectable drug's global sales soared 19.1 percent to $2.77 billion in the quarter, outpacing 16 percent growth in the prior quarter. Humira accounted for almost 60 percent of total sales, illustrating AbbVie's growing reliance on a product that will lose U.S. patent protection in late 2016. Many analysts, however, expect sales of Humira to keep growing after its patent expires because it may take many years for generic drugmakers to develop and win approvals for complex \"biosimilar\" forms of the biotech drug. In the meantime, AbbVie is hoping to develop and market lucrative new drugs, including oral treatments for hepatitis C that could be approved by early 2015 and a promising treatment called ABT-199 for various blood cancers. \"The AbbVie story is good as long as Humira grows, and it's growing above expectations,\" said Barclays analyst Tony Butler, who said the quarterly sales topped his forecast by $100 million. Humira sales were helped by a 15 percent price increase in the United States over the past year, he added. Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger predicted Humira's annual sales will jump another 30 percent, to $13 billion, by 2016. \"It should have peak sales similar to Lipitor,\" Risinger said, referring to Pfizer Inc's ( PFE.N ) cholesterol fighter, which had been the world's top-selling drug until it lost patent protection in late 2011. AbbVie said it had earned $964 million, or 60 cents per share, in the third quarter, compared with $1.59 billion, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. Excluding write-downs of intangible assets and other special charges, profit was 82 cents per share. That was 4 cents above the analysts' average estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, based in suburban Chicago, raised the low end of its 2013 earnings forecast to $3.11 per share from $3.07, while keeping the high end at $3.13. Sales rose 3.3 percent to $4.66 billion, beating Wall Street expectations of $4.52 billion. Synthroid sales jumped 23 percent to $161 million, while sales of Creon, a digestive enzymes drug, rose almost 10 percent to $101 million. But sales of TriCor and Trilipix, drugs used to lower blood fats called triglycerides, fell 88 percent to $39 million due to competition from cheaper generics. Sales of AndroGel, a topical testosterone gel, and of HIV treatment Kaletra, both fell 11 percent. Shares of AbbVie were up 2.4 percent at $49.09 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

      " MELBOURNE/LONDON  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) has agreed to sell its majority stake in Australia's third-largest thermal coal mine to Glencore Xstrata and Japan's Sumitomo Corporation for just over $1 billion, pushing ahead with plans to focus on larger, core operations. \n",
      " Rio put its 50.1 percent stake in the Clermont mine in Queensland on the block earlier this year, but appetite had been considered by industry advisers to be weak, given a poor outlook for coal prices and high costs in Australia. The sale - for $1.015 billion in cash - will be a welcome boost for Rio's plan to sell down unwanted assets, as the world's third-largest miner pares debts of $22 billion, cuts costs and tries to meet shareholder demands for better returns. Rio said on Friday it had announced or completed almost $3 billion of divestments this year, but its larger planned sales - including a stake in Canada's largest iron ore producer, Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) - have struggled. The miner has already scrapped the sale of its diamond unit and aluminum. \"It's not a bad price (for Rio), the market will be reasonably pleased,\" said analyst Des Kilalea at RBC Capital Markets. \"But the one everyone is looking for is IOC.\" Glencore ( GLEN.L ), the largest trader of seaborne thermal coal and a leading thermal coal producer, has slashed costs in its coal unit as it cuts back following the takeover of miner Xstrata. But it has also said it can benefit from increased blending and trading opportunities - as well as from a rise in thermal coal prices that it says are at unsustainable lows. \"Glencore is contrarian, this is the sort of deal that they do - buying up assets that no one else appears to want,\" one senior industry source said. \"This is not huge money for them, and it is about controlling a bigger piece of production.\" The deal will be financed by debt for around half the purchase price, meaning Glencore and partner Sumitomo will put in only just over $250 million in cash each. Clermont, a large-scale open pit mine, is also relatively low cost, thanks to a low strip ratio - meaning less waste has to be removed to expose ore for mining - and the ability to sell 90 percent of coal without washing. COAL TALKS After this cash deal, Glencore and Sumitomo ( 8053.T ) will each own half of the stake through GS Coal Pty, meaning an economic interest of 25.05 percent each. Glencore will assume Rio's role in managing the mine and marketing production. Glencore and Rio have separately been discussing a possible combination of their coal assets in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, to help cut costs and shore up margins with thermal coal prices holding close to four-year lows. But sources familiar with the matter have said those talks were progressing slowly. Glencore is the top thermal coal exporter in Australia, while Rio Tinto is the largest thermal coal producer in Australia's Hunter Valley. Glencore said in a presentation last month that a third of seaborne power-station coal production is loss-making, hit by oversupply. It has said the situation is unsustainable, as demand from new generating capacity in Asia increases. Rio's co-owners in the Clermont mine are Mitsubishi Corp ( 8058.T ), Japan's Electric Power Development Co Ltd ( 9513.T ) and a consortium of Japanese power companies. Dutch trader Trafigura and India's Adani Enterprises Ltd ( ADEL.NS ) had put in bids below $850 million for the Clermont stake, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Deutsche Bank advised Rio Tinto on the sale.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - The chief executive of outsourcing firm Serco has quit as part of a major reorganisation aimed at rebuilding its reputation with its biggest customer, the British government, following a series of scandals. \n",
      " The UK government, which accounts for about 25 percent of Serco's revenue, said in July it would not award the firm or rival G4S any new contracts pending a review of existing ones, after an audit discovered they had charged for tagging criminals who were dead, in prison or not being monitored. The scandal has intensified the debate in Britain over the outsourcing of public services to profit-driven private firms - a key strategy to reduce government spending, but which has also led to a string of embarrassments, such as when G4S failed to supply enough security staff for the 2012 London Olympics. On Thursday, G4S said its UK chief executive had resigned and been replaced by the group's chief operating officer. Serco, with over 120,000 staff in more than 30 countries, said on Friday Chris Hyman had resigned as chief executive. As part of a company-wide overhaul, Serco said it would strengthen its board by adding three new non-executive directors and would split its UK central government work into a separate unit, allowing it to devote more time to its top customer. \"We are taking all of the actions which we believe are appropriate in order to restore that confidence of government,\" Chairman Alastair Lyons told Reuters. \"I have a high level of confidence that it's repairable.\" Lyons added that Serco had already commissioned a search to find a new CEO, whom he said would come from outside the firm. The news was taken well by investors, with Serco shares up 1 percent around 1520 GMT. It was also welcomed by the government which described it as a \"positive move\". WIDER SCRUTINY Serco shares had lost more than 10 percent in value, or 320 million pounds ($517 million), since the government first said it had concerns over the tagging contract. In August, the company's problems increased when the British justice ministry asked police to investigate alleged fraudulent behavior by some Serco staff working on a prisoner escorting contract. The scandals came to light as the government centralized more procurement and placed suppliers under increased scrutiny. Prior to 2010, firms like Serco had enjoyed double-digit percentage rises in revenue for two decades. Four of the government's biggest suppliers - G4S, Serco as well as rivals Capita and Atos - have been called to appear before a committee of British lawmakers next month for questioning about the outsourcing sector. Analysts at Jefferies said Serco's move to split its UK & Europe division would allow greater transparency around profits from its contracts - a key government priority. Serco, which makes annual revenue of around 4.9 billion pounds, has continued to win deals in its other markets, such as a 335 million pound tie-up to run Dubai's metro system, though it has encountered some problems abroad. It is due to appear in the U.S. House of Representatives to explain its part in the troubled rollout of the \"Obamacare\" healthcare laws, though it is not accused of any wrongdoing. Ed Casey, who has led Serco's Americas division since 2005, will take over as acting CEO while the group looks for a full-time replacement. \"He has not been involved with the UK business up to now so whilst he understands all the issues from being part of the executive committee, he is able to actually come to this with a completely fresh relationship with government,\" Lyons said. Serco is now awaiting the results of three UK reviews: one concerning details of its tagging contract, a Cabinet Office investigation into all its biggest government deals, and an assessment led by government non-executive directors into whether it has taken appropriate steps to address shortcomings. All three are expected to report before the end of the year. On top of those, the UK government has also asked the Serious Fraud Office to consider carrying out an investigation into G4S and then later Serco. Serco has agreed to repay all past profits on the prisoner escorting contract and forgo any future profits and will repay any amount due on the electronic tagging contract.

      " (Reuters) - World's biggest fast-food chain seeks new ketchup for its famous french fries. \n",
      " McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) on Friday said it plans to end its 40-year relationship with ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, since that company is now led by Bernardo Hees, the former chief executive of hamburger rival Burger King Worldwide Inc ( BKW.N ). \"As a result of recent management changes at Heinz, we have decided to transition our business to other suppliers over time,\" McDonald's said in a statement. \"We have spoken to Heinz and plan to work together to ensure a smooth and orderly transition,\" said McDonald's, which has more than 34,000 restaurants around the globe. Heinz declined to comment. \"As a matter of policy, Heinz does not comment on relationships with customers,\" company spokesman Michael Mullen said. The switch will be more apparent overseas than in the United States, as McDonald's only serves Heinz ketchup in two domestic markets - Pittsburgh and Minneapolis, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported on Friday. Indeed, ketchup packages handed out at McDonald's restaurants in the United States often say only \"fancy ketchup.\" Most in-store ketchup dispensers are not branded. The move from McDonald's could benefit Heinz ketchup rivals Hunt's, owned by ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ), and Del Monte. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and an investment fund affiliated with 3G Capital bought Heinz for $28 billion in June and immediately named Hees CEO. Burger King went public in June 2012, less than two years after it was taken private by 3G Capital Management LLC, which retains a stake in the fast-food chain. Burger King has been a Heinz customer for \"decades\" and uses its products in roughly 80 percent of markets around the world, spokesman Miguel Piedra told Reuters.

      " SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China's top legal body has strengthened consumer rights in the country after it revised the nation's Consumer Protection Law on Friday, the first major overhaul in two decades. \n",
      " The revisions increase consumer powers, add rules for the booming Internet shopping sector and stiffen punishments for businesses that mislead shoppers. Chinese regulators have been cracking down on real or perceived corporate wrongdoing, with domestic and international infant formula makers and drugmakers particularly coming under the spotlight this year. Global firms like Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) have also been getting caught in the glare, while South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), the world's largest smartphone maker, had to apologize to Chinese customers on Thursday after a broadcast on China Central Television criticized company repair policies. China is also trying to stimulate domestic consumer spending as it attempts to transition from an investment-led economy to a more consumption-driven model. But domestic consumers are often wary of product safety and quality, with 3.8 billion yuan ($624.79 million) worth of poor quality goods sold in China between 2010 and 2012, according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). \"Strengthening consumer confidence will benefit the whole nation's economic development and boost domestic demand,\" Jia Dongming, director of the civil law working committee under China's Standing Committee, said at a press briefing to announce the changes to the law. The amendments to the 1993 law include increasing compensation for consumers and raising fines for retailers who violate the law, including in cases where faulty products lead to consumers being harmed or killed. Compensation rose from equaling the amount of damages to three times the amount. China will also strengthen the role of the China Consumers' Association, which will be able to represent groups of consumers in any wider class actions against retailers. Officials also stressed the growing importance of protecting consumers in China's booming online shopping sector, which has expanded rapidly with the rise of market leader Alibaba's Taobao, Wal-Mart Stores Inc's ( WMT.N ) Yihaodian and 360Buy.com. Internet sales have risen almost 50-fold since 2006 to hit 1.3 trillion yuan ($213.75 billion) in 2012, according to Jia, while analysts predict e-commerce will account for a fifth of total retail sales in China within five years. The law will make it easier for consumers to return goods bought online, while sellers will bear the burden of proof in any disputes. Online retailers will also have to meet strict privacy requirements, including requesting users' permission to use any personal data. \"The make-up and challenges of the consumer sector has completely changed and so the law has had to adapt for the times,\" said Jia.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) will team up to bid on a new U.S. Air Force long-range bomber program, a multibillion-dollar project that U.S. Air Force officials have described as a top acquisition priority. \n",
      " Boeing, which has played a role in every U.S. bomber program since World War Two, would be the prime contractor on the next-generation bomber program, with Lockheed as its primary subcontractor, the companies said on Friday. The Air Force has said it plans to buy as many as 100 new bombers for no more than $550 million each. Air Force spokesman Ed Gulick said $581 million had been spent on the Long-Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) program to date, starting in fiscal 2012. \"The LRS-B is a top modernization priority for the Air Force and critical to our national security,\" he said. \"The Air Force looks forward to working with all participating industry partners on this very important program.\" Gulick had no immediate comment on the pact between Boeing and Lockheed. The Air Force estimate of $550 million a plane reflects only the procurement cost of the new weapons, but not the cost of developing the plane or construction of new hangars. In July, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel vowed to protect several weapons programs, including the new bomber program, if Congress failed to reverse mandatory budget cuts and the military opted to preserve high-end capabilities over size. Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ), maker of the B-2 stealth bomber, is also expected to compete to build the new long-range strike bomber, a program that's expected to reap billions of dollars of revenue for the winning bidder. Northrop spokesman Randy Belote declined to comment on the Boeing-Lockheed teaming agreement but said his company viewed the bomber program as \"vital to both national security and the power projection capability of the U.S. Air Force.\" STIFF COMPETITION The teaming agreement brings together the Pentagon's two largest suppliers: Lockheed, ranked No. 1, and Boeing, the second-largest, which some analysts said would present Northrop with stiff competition. \"A Boeing-Lockheed teaming arrangement leaves Northrop as the odd man out,\" said Virginia-based defense consultant Loren Thompson. \"It would be tough for Northrop to compete against a Boeing-Lockeed Martin bomber team, which would have greater resources and probably a greater ability to bid aggressively.\" Still, Brett Lambert, who retired as the Pentagon's top industrial base official in August, told Reuters he did not think there was a favored bidder at the moment. \"The department is looking at this as an absolute necessity and they are absolutely committed to a competition. They haven't penciled anyone in,\" he said. \"That's the great thing about competition: it often surprises you.\" Lambert said it was a major accomplishment that the new bomber had survived recent budget cuts, given mounting pressure to cancel new programs. Top Pentagon leaders had made a concerted effort to continue funding initial design work on the bomber program to ensure that all three companies were able to maintain teams of design engineers, he said. \"The easy solution, given the budget environment would have been to terminate the program, but the department made a conscious decision to keep the design teams in place,\" he said. Lockheed and Boeing had teamed up in 2008 to develop a joint bid for the bomber, but parted ways two years later. Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates had put the program on hold in 2009 and asked the Air Force to find a more affordable approach. In a statement, Boeing said the team would benefit from nearly two centuries of combined experience in designing, developing and testing aircraft for militaries around the world. Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed's aeronautics division, said the teaming agreement would help the companies \"affordably design, develop, produce and sustain\" a new bomber that met the Air Force's budget and schedule requirements. Shares of Boeing, Lockheed and other major defense contractors traded higher Friday after a round of better-than-expected recent earnings in the sector. Lockheed shares were up more than 1 percent at $133.81 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Boeing shares were up 1.6 percent at $131.04. Northrop shares rose 0.8 percent to $108.34.

      " Mark Rosenblum, the former employee, sued Thomson Reuters in April, alleging that he lost his job without severance after telling the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he believed Thomson Reuters had violated insider-trading laws by the early release of the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers to some subscribers. Thomson Reuters requested that a Manhattan federal court dismiss the claim on the basis that Rosenblum contacted the FBI and not the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides whistleblower protections. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan concluded, however, that a 2011 SEC rule did not require Rosenblum to make a report to that regulator to obtain whistleblower protection. Scheindlin also dismissed Rosenblum's claim for punitive damages, saying the law did not authorize them. A spokesman for Thomson Reuters said the company is disappointed with the court's decision. \"The company has policies in place to ensure that all terminations are handled fairly and in accordance with applicable law,\" said Thomson Reuters spokesman Lemuel Brewster. \"This decision is not a ruling on the merits of the case, and we look forward to presenting the facts relating to the plaintiff's claims as this litigation unfolds. We remain confident that the claims asserted against us are baseless, and we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves in court.\" Attorneys for Rosenblum were not immediately available to comment. Rosenblum claimed that Thomson Reuters released the University of Michigan survey results to trading clients who pay a higher fee to receive data two seconds before other regular subscribers. Regular subscribers get it five minutes ahead of the general public. In July, Thomson Reuters said it would suspend its early release of the consumer sentiment data to its high-speed trading clients after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched a probe into the matter and requested the suspension. The case is Rosenblum v. Thomson Reuters (Markets) LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-02219. (Reporting by  Jennifer Saba  in New York; Editing by  Alden Bentley )\n",

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Orders for a wide range of U.S.-made capital goods plummeted in September and consumer sentiment weakened sharply in October, signs that a budget battle in Washington has held back the economy. \n",
      " New orders of non-military capital goods other than aircraft, an indicator of business spending plans, fell 1.1 percent last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That could be a sign businesses were shutting their wallets as the fiscal debate was heating up in Washington. A surge in volatile aircraft orders helped push overall orders of long-lasting factory goods to rise a more-than-expected 3.7 percent during the month. But orders for durable goods, which include everything from toasters to tanks, fell 0.1 percent when factoring out transportation equipment. The data suggests businesses may have scaled back investment plans as a political impasse in Washington threatened to lead the government to miss payments on its obligations, although firms also could be trimming these plans over more general doubts regarding the economy's strength. \"We are looking at a situation where businesses were preparing for the chaos in Washington which actually happened,\" said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economics Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The government impasse was eventually resolved in October, though not before a partial government shutdown left hundreds of thousands of people out of work for weeks and also delayed the release of a slew of economic data. While the economy was already struggling before the government shutdown, economists estimate the shutdown will shave as much as 0.6 percentage point off annualized fourth-quarter gross domestic product through reduced government output and damage to both consumer and business confidence. And even before the impasse, the pace of hiring by U.S. employers had slowed sharply in September. Worries over the economic fallout helped push U.S. consumer sentiment in October to its lowest level since the end of last year, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading of consumer sentiment for the month. The survey's index for consumer sentiment fell to 73.2 in October from 77.5 in September. It was the lowest final reading since December 2012. \"This could cast a dark cloud over the year-end holiday season in terms of consumer spending,\" said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. Separately, U.S. wholesale inventories rose more than expected in August, the Commerce Department said. The federal government shut down for 16 days in the first half of October as Congressional Republicans sought to undermine President Barack Obama's signature health care law as a condition of funding the government. The government also came close to breaching its borrowing limit, which compounded the crisis and could have pushed the country closer to a historic debt default. Friday's data bodes poorly for the outlook for GDP in the third quarter as well. Shipments of non-military capital goods other than aircraft fell 0.2 percent in September. These so-called \"core\" shipments, which the government uses directly for calculating total economic growth, have now fallen in two of three months in the third quarter. \"Most businesses are continuing to sit on their hands rather than aggressively invest and expand,\" said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. The data led Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto, to lower his forecast for third-quarter economic growth to a 1.8 percent rate from a 2 percent rate. Friday's durable goods report was part of the catch-up effort in publishing a backlog of economic data due to the shutdown, and the data included revised readings for durable goods orders in August. Investors on Wall Street appeared to take little direction from the data. U.S. stock indexes opened higher on the back of strong results from companies such as Amazon and Microsoft.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two U.S. law firms are in advanced merger discussions to create one of the 10 largest in the country, according to the firms' chairmen. \n",
      " San Francisco-based Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe is expected to sign a letter of intent next week to join with Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a source with direct knowledge of the discussions said. Pillsbury Chairman James Rishwain and Orrick Chairman Mitch Zuklie issued a joint statement to Reuters on Friday that said: \"Our firms are in exploratory discussions about a possible combination. These talks are serving to confirm the great respect our firms have for each other.\" Orrick, with about 1,000 lawyers, is known for its intellectual property, litigation, emerging companies and corporate practices, while the 700-lawyer Pillsbury of New York has a well-known energy practice. Their joint revenue, based on figures reported by the legal trade publication American Lawyer for 2012, would place them at No. 9 in the United States. Orrick is known for representing clients such as Apple ( AAPL.O ), Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) and PG&E Corp ( PCG.N ), according to its website. Pillsbury has represented Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ), BNY Mellon BKBML.UL and Xerox ( XRX.N ) among others, according to legal experts and the firm's website. Orrick has represented Oracle Corp ( ORCL.N ) in a patent lawsuit against Google ( GOOG.O ), over the Android mobile operating technology, and Microsoft in a patent lawsuit against Barnes & Noble ( BKS.N ) over its Nook electronic book reader. Meanwhile, Pillsbury has represented a number of companies and banks in mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings this year. There have been at least 58 mergers between U.S. law firms announced in 2013, a particularly active year, according to legal consultancy Altman Weil. In July merger activity in the first half of 2013 was its highest since 2008, it reported. The mergers have been driven both by the globalization of corporate clients that increasingly face complex national and international legal issues and by sluggish demand for legal services, leading firms to try and boost revenue by joining forces, legal experts said. At the same time, many large law firms in California have grown outside the state through mergers and acquisitions and by picking up partners as legal work has migrated to other parts of the country, according to legal experts. Over the years, they said, major financial institutions such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo have relocated their headquarters and offices outside of California, and as a result, many major law firms such as Paul Hastings, Latham & Watkins and Morrison & Foerster have seen their firms grow elsewhere. \"The California economy isn't growing like it once was years ago,\" said Robert O'Brien, a partner at Arent Fox in Los Angeles who acknowledged that other major law firms have rejiggered their business models to remain competitive. \"Los Angeles has become very much middle market,\" said O'Brien. One source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity but was familiar with the latest merger, said that the discussions between the firms had been ongoing for months and that Orrick is expected to sign the letter of intent sometime next week. The deal could still fall apart, the source said. Both firms have been looking for partners for some time. The more profitable firm, Orrick, engaged in protracted merger discussions in 2006 with Dewey Ballantine, according to legal experts, but Dewey ended up merging with LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae to form the ill-fated Dewey & LeBoeuf later that year. Pillsbury has had discussions with a variety of firms such as the Washington law firm Dickstein Shapiro and the larger Fulbright & Jaworski, which ended up merging with the UK-based Norton Rose earlier this year.

      " ANKARA  (Reuters) - Turkey would be open to new offers for a missile defense system if a deal agreed with a Chinese firm under U.S. sanctions falls through, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan was quoted on Friday as saying. \n",
      " The NATO member's decision to co-produce the long-range air and missile defense system with China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp (CPMIEC) over rival bids from Russian, U.S. and European firms has raised concern among Turkey's Western allies. \"Currently I don't know if there are different proposals from the other parties. If there are they could be considered,\" the pro-government Bugun newspaper quoted Erdogan as telling a reporter on his plane early on Thursday. \"Only if China pulls out of the negotiations will the possibility of talks with the other sides emerge.\" A senior Turkish official familiar with the matter confirmed Erdogan had made the comments. The U.S. ambassador to Turkey said on Thursday Washington was concerned that the $3.4 billion deal with the Chinese firm could undermine allied air defenses and had begun \"expert\" talks with Ankara to assess the potential impact. NATO has also said it is worried about Turkey buying a system not compatible with those of other member states, potentially undermining a core principle of the 28-nation alliance. Turkey announced in September it had chosen the FD-2000 missile defense system CPMIEC over rival systems from Franco/Italian Eurosam SAMP/T and U.S. firm Raytheon Co ( RTN.N ), though officials have since said the decision is not yet final. Both Turkey and China have said Ankara's decision was made on purely commercial grounds. Turkey has said CPMIEC offered the most competitive terms and would enable production to be partly based in Turkey, helping it achieve its long-standing goal of strengthening its domestic defense industry. Raytheon said on Thursday it was still ready to sell its Patriot missile defense system to Turkey if Ankara changed its mind. CPMIEC is under U.S. sanctions for violations of the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act.

      " (Reuters) - A Michigan man rejected an offer from Wal-Mart Stores Inc to rehire him after he was fired for helping a woman who was being attacked in the store parking lot during his meal break. \n",
      " Kristopher Oswald, 30, who worked nights stocking shelves at a Wal-Mart store in Hartland Township, located northwest of Detroit, said on Friday that he does not feel safe going back to work. \"I believe my job was only offered to me because of the negative publicity they received,\" Oswald said. \"There is no way I can expect to walk in as if I was a new hire and everything would be OK.\" A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said the company has a strict policy against retaliation and offered to accommodate Oswald with safety measures such as an escort to and from his vehicle into the store. \"His position is still open to him now if he wants to come back to the store. We'd welcome him back,\" company spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said. She also said the company offered to reimburse Oswald for lost wages. Wal-Mart said Oswald's initial firing resulted from his violation of company policy that requires employees to alert store management and call police instead of intervening in dangerous situations. Publicity about the firing prompted Wal-Mart's corporate office to review the parking lot security footage and police report, Buchanan said. Oswald, a temporary employee who had worked seven weeks for the company prior to the incident, was offered his job back. \"Everyone makes mistakes and so do companies,\" Buchanan said. Oswald was sitting in his car around 2:30 a.m. on October 13, eating a sandwich, when he heard a woman scream, he said. A man was sprawled on the hood of the woman's car. When she tried to pry him off her vehicle, he attacked her. Oswald said he confronted the man, who then began punching him in the head and threatening to kill him. He was able to subdue the man, but then two other men jumped him from behind. Local authorities arrived on the scene and quickly broke up the fight. Oswald said he is seeking therapy to work through the trauma of the attack. \"I'm being haunted by this incident because I'm not a violent person,\" Oswald said. \"All I did was what anyone should have done in that situation.\" (Reporting by Lisa Maria Garza; Editing by  Greg McCune  and  Bob Burgdorfer )\n",

      " Edward DeMarco, acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said ending the defined benefit plans \"eliminates risk to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and helps to conserve their assets on behalf of taxpayers, one of our main priorities as conservator.\" The plans had previously been closed to new entrants. Employees of both companies may choose a pension annuity, or roll over their benefits to other defined contribution plans such as a 401(k) or an individual retirement account. Many U.S. companies have in recent years frozen or ended their traditional pension plans to save money and reduce potential payouts, while shifting the burden of investing to employees. As of February 2013, Fannie Mae employed about 7,200 people, while Freddie Mac employed about 5,000. Both were seized by the U.S. government in September 2008 amid soaring mortgage losses.

      " TOKYO  (Reuters) - The head of Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ) looks set to survive the revelation of bank loans to mobsters, a move that could revive his recently flagging efforts to improve corporate governance at Japan's second-largest bank by assets. \n",
      " Mizuho will not sack Yasuhiro Sato as president and CEO, but may suspend his pay for some period, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The bank is expected to announce its response to the scandal on Monday. The uproar over the mob loans has sidetracked Sato over the past month from his quest to unify the fractious financial group, which lags Japan's other two \"megabanks\" in key measures of financial performance. It comes as Mizuho is trying to expand its loan business globally and establish itself as \"Asia's core bank\". But the mob loans reflect badly on Mizuho's past governance more than on Sato's reform drive, said banking analyst Toyoki Sameshima at BNP Paribas Securities. \"The matter gives all the more reason for Sato to push forward with fixing the bank's problems,\" Sameshima said. \"I don't think it will be a significant setback to Sato's efforts to change the bank or his leadership.\" In the latest scandal involving a major Japanese company having ties with the underworld, regulators disclosed in late September that Mizuho had funneled some $2 million through an affiliated financing firm to organized crimes figures in 230 small transactions, mostly car loans. Mizuho initially said that knowledge of the loans went only as far as the bank's compliance officers, but later the bank acknowledged that the transactions had been reported to top officials, including Sato, at board meetings. The Financial Services Agency late last month ordered Mizuho to improve its business practices after it failed to stop the mob lending more than two years after finding out about the loans. Working with an outside panel of lawyers, Mizuho aims to submit a report to the regulator on Monday. The scandal, in addition to highlighting the pervasive reach of \"yakuza\" crime syndicates and other underworld elements throughout Japan Inc, also epitomizes the lapses in corporate governance that Sato himself has been struggling to fix. \"Sato was getting a tighter grip on the bank and his leadership was getting traction,\" said a former Mizuho executive. But the scandal \"has pretty much undone it.\" Mizuho is particularly vulnerable to bad governance and compliance because 13 years after its formation, in a three-way merger of failing banks during Japan's financial crisis, it remains three banks in one. \"ONE MIZUHO\" Sato has been viewed very favorably by investors as \"a symbol of One Mizuho\", the bank's unification effort, said banking analyst Yoshinobu Yamada at Deutsche Securities. The 61-year-old banker has been trying to unify a financial giant that still maintains separate cultures and loyalties from its long-defunct constituent lenders: the Industrial Bank of Japan, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank. The tussling fiefdoms have fostered a culture of protecting turf and refraining from taking broad responsibility for problems, Mizuho bankers admit. Japanese mergers often leave legacy factions, but Mizuho is an extreme case because none of the three banks clearly dominated. Top Mizuho jobs have rotated among the three factions, with none stamping its imprint on the broader institution. That has contributed to the bank's inability to generate profits and shareholder value commensurate with its enormous heft. Mizuho's assets are 25 percent smaller than those of Japan's biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( 8306.T ), but Mizuho's market value is a full 44 percent lower and its net profits for the latest quarter were 34 percent lower than MUFG's. Even more starkly, Mizuho is 16 percent bigger by assets than Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ( 8316.T ) but its market capitalization and profits are nearly 30 percent lower. Sato, an urbane banker with a wealth of international contacts, is a product of IBJ, originally a government-backed bank that helped finance Japan's rise as an industrial power. IBJ bankers have famously considered themselves an economic and social elite, especially compared with their Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Fuji colleagues, who contributed a massive retail presence to Mizuho. Fighting to break the silo mentality, Sato at one point rejected a proposed line-up of senior management that favored ex-IBJ executives, said a Mizuho official familiar with the process. Sato also led July's consolidation of Mizuho's corporate and retail lending units, also meant to unify the Mizuho brand and expertise. \"NOT NOTICED\" After a ritual deep bow of contrition at a news conference earlier this month, Sato said he had been \"in a position to know\" about the mob loans, but had not noticed them. He said that at eight meetings of the Mizuho holding company and retail bank in 2011 and 2012, the loans were mentioned in attachment documents about \"the resolution of transactions with anti-social forces\" - a euphemism for the yakuza - at Mizuho-affiliated consumer-finance firm Orient Corp ( 8585.T ). \"We have no alternative but to say that the Mizuho group overall was lacking in awareness of the issues,\" Sato said. \"I deeply regret this.\" A former Mizuho director said meeting documents would regularly have a line on the bank's handling of anti-social forces, which were treated as little more than a statistical box-ticking exercise. Sato is expected to keep his post in part because the FSA initially backed him to take the helm at Mizuho and they see no viable successor. \"He's eloquent. He's full of ideas,\" said a source at the regulator. \"The FSA pushed for Mr. Sato.\" A Mizuho spokesman said the bank had made no decision on how it would deal with the scandal. The bank in recent weeks has declined to make Sato or other top executives available for interview. Mizuho's stock has fallen 8.5 percent since the lending scandal emerged, versus declines of just under 6 percent for MUFG and SMFG and 5 percent for the broader Tokyo market. \"Although Mizuho is underperforming its rival megabanks, market consensus is that there won't be a further surprise to hit the bank if Sato is not sacked,\" said Fumio Matsumoto, a fund manager at T&D Asset Management, who had continued to hold Mizuho shares in his portfolio since the incident. \"What the stock market had feared was the possibility that Sato would resign.\" Sato will likely have his pay suspended for six months while more than 30 senior executives will also be punished, Japanese media reported on Friday. Takashi Tsukamoto is likely to step down as chairman of Mizuho Bank, the firm's core banking unit, while remaining chairman of the holding company, sources told Reuters.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The total value of the claims that market makers can recover after suffering losses due to Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's botched handling of Facebook Inc's initial public offering is $41.6 million, the exchange operator said Friday. \n",
      " The claims figure, which was calculated by Wall Street's industry-funded watchdog the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, falls short of the $62 million that Nasdaq had initially set aside to repay brokerages that lost money. Nasdaq said the figure is lower in part because some claims did not qualify for compensation under its plan. The main reason for the lower figure, however, was because one firm opted to try to recover funds through arbitration. The announcement did not name the brokerage, which was UBS AG. UBS has pegged its losses from the glitch-ridden IPO at $350 million and was vocal in its decision to file an arbitration demand which claimed Nasdaq had violated a contract agreement. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet, however, blocked the bank's arbitration proceeding over the summer on several grounds, including a determination that the bank's claims did not fall within the scope of the arbitration provision in their services agreement. \"Nasdaq has demonstrated that the arbitration should be enjoined because it is likely to succeed on the merits and will suffer irreparable harm,\" Sweet wrote. \"Given the substantial federal issues posed by UBS claims, the threat of an arbitration panel issuing a decision that may conflict with the decision of a federal court in a parallel litigation also weighs strongly against permitting UBS to proceed with its arbitration proceeding,\" he added. Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for UBS, told Reuters on Friday that the bank has since appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She could not comment further, as the case is currently under seal. Facebook's problematic debut on the Nasdaq exchange on May 18, 2012, resulted from a systems failure that prevented the timely delivery of order confirmations and left more than 30,000 Facebook orders stuck in Nasdaq's system for more than two hours. Many brokerages were left in the dark wondering if their trades went through. Major market makers estimated they lost collectively up to $500 million in the IPO. Nasdaq devised a plan to compensate firms up to $62 million, and laid out the criteria for how firms can be eligible to file claims. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the compensation plan in March, and FINRA was put in charge of processing the claims for restitution. Several months after approving the plan, the SEC in May filed civil charges against Nasdaq, saying the exchange's \"ill-fated decisions\" on the day of the Facebook IPO led to a series of regulatory violations. Nasdaq settled the charges and agreed to pay a $10 million fine. (Reporting by Sarah N. Lynch; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Phil Berlowitz)\n",

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Pentagon's chief arms buyer wants details on how Lockheed Martin Corp and other companies will be held accountable for the quality and reliability of the F-35 fighter jet as he considers whether to approve an increase in the plane's production, U.S. defense officials said on Friday. \n",
      " Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, is asking the Pentagon office that runs the $392 billion F-35 program to map out how it will ensure the quality, reliability and maintainability of the new warplanes as production ramps up in coming years, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Kendall chaired a five-hour review of the Pentagon's biggest arms program on Monday that showed progress in F-35 development, production and testing, and confirmed that Lockheed and its suppliers were technically ready to increase production. But Kendall and other Pentagon officials want to make sure that they have contractual language and other tools in hand to hold Lockheed and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, responsible if problems arise. \"The government wants to see how it can incentivize the contractors to do well, and what leverage it will have if they don't,\" said one source familiar with the program. The Pentagon drive for more rigorous oversight could result in additional clauses in the next contracts for jets and engines. The contracts are being negotiated separately by Pratt and Lockheed with the government in coming months. Government plans call for Lockheed to increase F-35 production from around 36 planes this year to 45 in 2016 and ramping up to 110 planes a year by the end of the decade. The company expects to build about 200 jets a year when the program, the largest in Pentagon history, is in full production. Decisions on future production rates have been complicated by the lack of a federal government budget for the new fiscal year that began October 1 and uncertainty about additional cuts in Pentagon spending due to take effect under sequestration unless Congress agrees on other deficit-reducing measures. Production levels also depend on F-35 orders by other countries, such as South Korea, which is expected to announce plans as early as December to buy F-35 fighters. South Korea would be the eighth foreign country to make a firm commitment to buying the F-35, joining the Netherlands, Britain, Italy, Australia, Norway, Israel and Japan. ASSEMBLED IN TEXAS Lockheed is anxious to lock down the production plan so it can buy additional $5 million assembly stations for the Fort Worth, Texas, plant where the jets are built. Kendall's office is expected to spell out its requirements for continued rigorous oversight of the F-35 program next week. Maureen Schumann, Kendall's spokeswoman, declined comment on the expected acquisition decision memorandum, or ADM. The Pentagon restructured the F-35 program in 2010, adding $6 billion to its development effort and slowing down production to reduce the number of possible retrofits needed since the plane was being produced as it was still undergoing testing, an approach known as \"concurrency.\" The F-35 program has also been subjected to intense oversight in recent years, including a 2012 review by the Pentagon inspector general's office of program quality that found over 800 issues on each jet built. Lockheed and the government say they have made significant progress since then. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the program for the Defense Department, was sharply critical of the contractors when he first took over last year and later accused them of trying to \"squeeze every nickel\" out of the government. But in September he told an Air Force audience that while he wished the program was \"further along,\" relations with the contractors were improving. Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said it would be inappropriate for the company to comment on a government meeting it did not attend. But he said the company was committed to continuing to improve the production and quality of the jets. \"We are fully committed to cost effectively driving costs out of the program while improving efficiencies to deliver the F-35's capabilities to the warfighter, allowing the services to meet their (initial operational capability) dates,\" he said.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul threatened on Friday to put a 'hold' on the nomination of Janet Yellen to be chair of the Federal Reserve unless he gets a vote on a bill he has sponsored to put the central bank under more scrutiny. \n",
      " \"As part of Senate consideration of the Janet Yellen nomination to be chair of the Federal Reserve, I will request a vote on my bipartisan Federal Reserve Transparency Act,\" Paul said in a statement. \"The American people deserve transparency from the Federal Reserve and the federal government as a whole.\" An aide to Paul, however, said no final decision had been made on whether to place a hold on the nomination. If Paul did move forward, it would force Yellen's supporters to round up 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to confirm her. The White House was always expected to have to secure 60 votes for the nomination to clear procedural roadblocks, and Democrats have repeatedly expressed confidence in their ability to do so. The swearing-in of New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker next week will return the Senate effectively to a 55-45 Democratic majority, meaning that only five Republican votes would be needed to support Yellen. White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One that the paperwork for the nomination had been submitted to the Senate, paving the way for formal consideration. \"We look forward to the Senate confirming her swiftly and in a bipartisan fashion for this very important role,\" he said. A Senate Banking Committee aide separately said that some of her paperwork had been received from the White House and her hearing was expected to be scheduled for next month. The banking panel, on which Democrats have a four-vote advantage, needs to vet the nomination before it goes before the full Senate for a final vote. Although Yellen, currently the Fed's vice chair, is expected to win confirmation, the process is likely to be contentious. Many Republicans have criticized the central bank's aggressive easing of monetary policy as a dangerous courtship of inflation that also risks fueling asset bubbles. To lay groundwork ahead of her hearing, Yellen has been lining up meetings with key members of the banking panel. She plans to meet with Republican Senator Richard Shelby next week, while Senator Bob Corker, also a Republican, is in talks to set up a meeting. Both are expected to oppose her nomination. Paul's bill would open up the Fed's monetary policy decisions to congressional audit, a step Fed officials have argued would undercut the central bank's political independence. The bill is co-sponsored by 24 Republicans and one Democrat. (Reporting by  Tim Ahmann ,  David Lawder  and  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Vicki Allen  and  James Dalgleish )\n",

      " U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield denied ING's bid to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, ruling that Mashreq's breach of contract claim should stand. However, she dismissed the bank's breach of fiduciary duty and fraud claims as duplicative of the contract claim. As a result, she said, Mashreq cannot pursue punitive damages in addition to the $43 million it claims it is owed, as New York law does not generally allow for punitive damages on a breach of contract claim. \"Mashreq's claim for breach of contract is plausible based on the facts alleged, and there is nothing in the plain language of the agreement or the revised guidelines that negates this plausibility as a matter of law,\" Schofield wrote. A spokesman and a lawyer for Netherlands-based ING did not immediately respond to a call for comment on Friday evening. Mashreq's attorney, Azra Mehdi, said the bank was pleased that its \"primary claim\" was preserved. \"We're very happy that Judge Schofield felt that our claims were timely and meritorious,\" she said. \"We're looking forward to continuing on.\" The lawsuit alleged that ING put more than two-thirds of a $108 million investment into \"toxic, illiquid structured securities\" in 2007 and hid the move in part by mixing the loans in reports with more reputable securities. Mashreq said it had lost at least $60 million at one point before recouping some of it through its own efforts. The case is MashreqBank PSC v.

      "\n",
      " NEW YORK/SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - When Bunge Ltd ( BG.N ) bought five sugar mills in Brazil's Sao Paulo state four years ago for $1.5 billion, they were considered the crown jewels of a burgeoning biofuel industry. \n",
      " Now, they may be little more than millstones, hard-to-sell assets at a time of crushed margins and weak prices. In the industry's first major capitulation to depressed market conditions, Bunge's new chief executive announced on Thursday he will explore options, including a sale, for the loss-making business. The news came as the firm blamed a $137 million quarterly net loss on its sugar operations, which were roiled by poor crop weather and low global prices. As one of the last big merchants to get into the sugar market, it seems logical they should be the first to bail out. While rivals like Cargill Inc CARG.UL and Louis Dreyfus Corp LOUDR.UL have been mainstays of the global sweetener trade for decades, grains-focused Bunge only entered in 2006, and began buying up mills in Brazil a year later. But Bunge is not alone: the costs of doing business in Brazil have rocketed while the country's frenzy over biofuels has faded; weak prices and four straight years of oversupply have dented global margins, hurting even the most efficient mills. \"Mills are facing a difficult time. Bunge is one of the victims of this environment,\" said Bruno Lima, a senior risk management consultant at INTL FCStone in Brazil. More than 40 smaller mills in Brazil's center-south have already been sold or shuttered in the past few years due to chronic operating losses and rising debts, removing 30 million tonnes (1 tonne = 1.102 metric tons) out of Brazil's 690 million tonnes output. HESITANT BUYERS With little sign of a sustained improvement, Bunge's peers may be hesitant to take a bigger bet on a years-long bear sugar market or Brazil's struggling cane industry. \"There are no buyers right now, so you could see them simply shutter a mill,\" said the former director of Brazil's milling industry association Unica, Eduardo Carvalho, who now heads his own consulting firm for the sector Expressao Consultoria. Bunge, one of the world's biggest sugar traders, has not yet discussed a sale with any suitors, but it may look to offload individual mills separately, Carvalho said. That would follow Louis Dreyfus' local sugar and ethanol milling spinoff BioSev, which in December sold its Sao Carlos mill in Sao Paulo state for 200 million reais ($90 million) to rival milling group Sao Martinho. Another alternative if there are no takers for Bunge's operations would be to wind down capacity. NEWCOMERS' HURDLES Selling the assets would mark an exit for Bunge from milling sugar cane just six years after buying its first mill in 2007. Analysts have estimated it has since plowed more than $2 billion into scooping up assets in Brazil's interior of Sao Paulo state, some of the choicest cane growing area in the world. Bunge now operates eight mills which process cane into sugar and ethanol with capacity to produce 1.2 million tonnes of sugar, less than 1 percent of global output. It was not alone. Many foreign firms including oil major BP PLC ( BP.L ) and Singapore-listed Olam ( OLAM.SI ) bought up mills and farms in a bid to vertically integrate their businesses and bet that tight sugar supplies and a growing ethanol market would boost earnings. But market conditions have soured as costs have escalated and the Brazilian government has placed caps on domestic fuel prices, hurting returns on ethanol and leaving the industry \"rife with uncertainty\", said Cesar Maria Borges, director of sugar and ethanol analyst JOB Economia. \"Multinationals like Bunge are shy about uncertainties that rest on government involvement, as is the case with the price of fuels in Brazil,\" he said. Given the troubling outlook for ethanol and slim margins, it made sense for Bunge's new Chief Executive Soren Schroder to cast a deeper look over the assets when he took over the reins in June. Weeks later, global prices hit three-year lows below 16 cents. To the surprise of many traders and producers, prices have since staged an impressive recovery, rising 18 percent since mid-July, as refiners bought at prices they considered a bargain. Even so, it was not enough to return Bunge's sugar operations to profit. That may be a harbinger of more pain to come for the beleaguered industry. \"If prices don't improve or if gasoline is not priced higher to help ethanol, the sector will stagnate or even decline,\" a U.S. trader warned.

      " (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay $5.1 billion to settle claims that it and firms it bought misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the quality of mortgage securities and home loans it sold to them during the housing boom. \n",
      " The bank and the agencies' regulator said Friday evening that the settlement was expected to be part of a tentative $13 billion deal that JPMorgan is negotiating with federal and state agencies over its mortgage bond liabilities. But the unusually timed announcement, which appeared to catch other parties involved in the negotiations by surprise, covered not only $4 billion that was expected as part of the larger deal but also an additional $1.15 billion to cover separate issues over home loans. The $4 billion portion of the payment, which was agreed on several weeks ago according to people familiar with the negotiations, resolves a 2-year-old lawsuit in which the regulator accused JPMorgan of overstating the quality of loans in mortgage securities in sold to Fannie and Freddie. The agency became impatient waiting for the larger settlement and wanted to move on to resolving similar lawsuits it brought against other banks, one person said. The additional $1.1 million resolves claims that JPMorgan breached the representations it made about the quality of single-family mortgages it sold the government-sponsored entities, the regulator said. Negotiations on the final terms of the larger settlement are continuing, people familiar with discussions said on Friday. While the parties have agreed to the framework of the deal, talks have slowed over whether JPMorgan can shift onto the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp liabilities of Washington Mutual, a failed lender which JPMorgan took over during the financial crisis. The FHFA settlement leaves open the possibility for JPMorgan to recoup payments related to Washington Mutual. The Justice Department, which is leading the larger negotiations, is seeking a provision in the larger settlement that bars JPMorgan from seeking to push the claims onto FDIC, according to one of the people familiar with the talks. It is unclear if the FDIC will be part of the larger settlement. FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment. The $13 billion settlement is also expected to include a $2 billion enforcement penalty for JPMorgan's mortgage securities sales which are being investigated by federal prosecutors in California; $4 billion of consumer debt relief; and $3 billion of assorted payments and compensation sought by other government agencies. \"This is a significant step as the government and J.P. Morgan Chase move to address outstanding mortgage-related issues,\" FHFA Acting Director Edward DeMarco said in a statement. The bank, the largest in the United States, said the deal was \"an important step towards a broader resolution\" of the firms mortgage-related issues with government agencies.

A government shutdown that left hundreds of thousands of people out of work for weeks this month is expected to make the fourth quarter even weaker. Economists expect the pace of inventory accumulation to slow a bit in the July-September quarter after consumer spending moderated in the previous quarter. Wholesale inventories in August were boosted by increases in stocks of professional equipment and autos. Sales at wholesalers increased 0.6 percent, beating economists' expectations. At August's sales pace it would take 1.17 months to clear shelves. The inventories/sales ratio was unchanged from July.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A proposal that would require stock exchanges to be better equipped to handle market disruptions does not go far enough to hold senior officials accountable for failures, Securities and Exchange Commission member Luis Aguilar said on Friday. \n",
      " \"The final rule should require an entity's senior officers to certify in writing that the entity has processes in place and adequate resources and staffing to achieve compliance,\" Aguilar said. In prepared remarks for a speech to a securities conference in Atlanta, Georgia, Aguilar also reiterated his support for strict corporate penalties and the agency's new policy of seeking admissions in some settlements, rather than letting defendants settle without admitting or denying the charges. Aguilar said he also wants the final version of the market disruption rule to do away with a \"safe harbor\" provision that would shield exchanges and their employees from liability as long as they have policies that are reasonably designed to comply with the rules. \"Such a vague and unprecedented carve-out would water down the rule,\" he said. \"The commission must adopt a strong and enforceable final rule that allows us to hold firms and individuals accountable when they fail to take adequate steps to comply with the rule.\" The SEC proposed in March the \"Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity,\" or Reg SCI. It followed a series of major blunders in 2012, from Nasdaq's botched handling of Facebook's initial public offering to Knight Capital's near collapse following a $440 million software glitch. The proposal targets exchanges, clearing agencies, certain large \"dark pool\" trading platforms and other self-regulatory organizations. It calls for these entities to report major systems disruptions and conduct testing on an industry-wide basis to ensure they have backup systems that are functioning properly. The SEC delayed adopting the plan and reopened the public comment period after exchanges including the Nasdaq and rival NYSE Euronext, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, called for a major reworking of the proposal over concerns about its costs and an \"unduly broad\" requirement to disseminate information to member firms about certain incidents. Since then, SEC Chair Mary Jo White has vowed to press ahead to finish the rule quickly in the wake of more recent technology glitches, including a three-hour halt on the Nasdaq earlier this summer due to a problem with the system that receives all traffic on quotes and orders. It is unclear how the final rule may shape up. While Aguilar has been vocally in favor of a tougher version of the rule, Michael Piwowar, a Republican SEC commissioner, issued a statement following the Nasdaq outage that urged the SEC to conduct more study \"before moving forward with further rulemakings.\" (Reporting by Sarah N.

      " (Reuters) - The options market is reflecting a higher probability of large upside moves in Apple Inc and Facebook Inc stock when both companies report quarterly earnings next week. \n",
      " Stock of Apple - the largest U.S. company by market value - is down 1 percent since January 1 while Facebook shares are up 95 percent. Many investors appear to be speculating on a rally rather than a sell-off in both stocks and are turning to the options market, buying calls at strike prices that are far above the current share price - also known as \"out-of-the-money.\" These are relatively more expensive than out-of-the-money puts. The situation is unusual, because investors are typically more concerned about downside risk and are willing to buy \"disaster puts\" - far out-of-the-money puts - at a higher relative price. This is because they do not want to lose a lot of money if the stock gets hit, said Steve Place, a founder of options analytics firm investingwithoptions.com in Austin, Texas. \"When we think about risk in the stock market, it's normally about the downside,\" he said. \"People are scared about the downside risk.\" Call options are a contract that gives the right to buy a stock at a fixed price by a certain date, while a put gives investors the right to sell a stock at a preset price. \"Both (stocks) continue to have inverted skew, indicating options traders believe a sharp move higher is more likely than a sharp move lower,\" said Matt Franz, investment adviser representative at Stutland Volatility Group in Chicago. SMILE Normally, skew is an options metric that shows out-of-the-money calls being priced at lower levels of implied volatility than both at-the-money options and out-of-the-money puts. Implied volatility is a measure of perceived risk of future stock movement. The options of both Apple and Facebook are currently reflecting what traders call a \"smile,\" referring to a curve or skew on the implied volatility of strike prices when one looks at a chart. \"What we are seeing right now in these tech stocks is a 'U' shape or a smile with both out-of-the-money puts and calls priced at higher levels of implied volatility than at-the-money strikes,\" said Jared Woodard, a principal at options research firm Condor Options in Forest, Virginia. In Facebook, the 10 percent out-of-the-money $57.50 strike calls expiring November 16 were priced at an implied volatility of 79 percent and cost $2.20 apiece as of Friday morning. The 10 percent out-of-the-money November $47 strike puts on Facebook were priced at 77 percent implied volatility at $1.68 as of Friday morning, according to Woodard. Facebook shares closed down 0.9 percent at $51.95 on Friday. In Apple, the 10 percent out-of-the-money November $585 strike calls were priced at about 38 percent implied volatility and cost $3.80 and the 10 percent out-of-the-money November $480 strike puts were priced at 36 percent implied volatility and are at $3.35 on Friday morning, Woodard said. Apple shares closed down 1.1 percent at $525.96 on the Nasdaq on Friday. Not everyone agrees that Apple's options pricing reflects bigger upside risk for the shares. \"While I see the option market reflecting more upside potential for Facebook, I see elevated upside and downside risk for Apple shares in the options skew,\" said Ophir Gottlieb, managing director of options analytics firm Livevol. Apple is due to report quarterly results on Monday and Facebook will report on Wednesday. Over the past two years, the inverted skew was seen about 13 percent of the time in Apple, said Henry Schwartz, president of options analytics firm Trade Alert. For Facebook, this inverted skew has occurred 11.8 percent of the time, since the company became public in May 2012, Schwartz added. \"Demand for upside calls has outpaced that for puts, driving an inversion in the stocks' skew, which is fairly atypical,\" said Mandy Xu, Credit Suisse equity derivatives strategist. Jason Goepfert, president of SentimenTrader.com, says Apple is currently ranked 10th among 1,500 stocks he tracks in terms of optimistic sentiment. His data, which goes back about two years, is based on a combination of put-to-call ratios and open interest, short interest figures, analyst recommendations and recent price momentum.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Energy Future Holdings has stepped up talks with bondholders of its regulated unit, several people close to the talks said on Thursday, as it holds out hope of reaching the framework of a restructuring agreement before an expected bankruptcy. \n",
      " The Texas utility is seeking support for a deal proposed by bank lenders at its unregulated holding company to restructure the bulk of its $40 billion in debt. Within the last few weeks, it has ramped up efforts to get first- and second-lien bondholders of Energy Future Intermediate Holdings (EFIH), its regulated holding company, behind the deal as well, the people close to the talks said. They declined to be named because talks are not public. The first-lien bondholders are being advised by lawyers from Ropes & Gray and financial advisers from Capstone, said the people. Pimco and Blackrock are among the largest holders of those bonds. The talks with the bondholders underscore the complexity of EFH's capital structure and its efforts to achieve a path for its restructuring before it files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company will likely file for bankruptcy, according to analysts and people familiar with the company's thinking, but would prefer to garner as much support from creditors as possible to facilitate a much easier and cheaper bankruptcy. Time to reach such a framework is running out: EFH has about $270 million in interest payments due next Friday, November 1, and while EFH could make the payment and extend the runway for restructuring talks, people close to the matter told Reuters it is more likely the company will file for bankruptcy protection ahead of the payment date. The company declined to comment for this story. BONDHOLDERS IN THE LOOP EFH, formerly TXU Corp, was taken private in 2007 in a $45 billion buyout, the largest-ever leveraged buyout. The deal saddled the company with debt just before a sharp decline in natural gas prices and energy markets. The buyout consortium included private equity firms KKR & Co LP ( KKR.N ), TPG Capital Management LP TPG.UL and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's ( GS.N ) private equity arm. The first- and second-lien bondholders at EFIH were initially not a critical part of restructuring discussions because they are considered in the money. But a restructuring plan put forth by the lenders, disclosed by the company in a Securities & Exchange filing last week, carries implications for their payments. While the economics of the plan could change, it purports to give the lenders all of the company's equity plus $8 billion in two tranches of debt, with the buyout sponsors receiving $800 million to be split with other creditor classes. The plan would forgo certain 'make-whole' payments that the EFIH first- and second-lien bondholders claim they are owed. Make-whole payments are generally triggered when creditors are repaid early to compensate them for the present value of foregone interest. The EFIH first-lien bondholders are negotiating in hopes of enforcing the payment if the bonds are refinanced, said two of the people close to the matter. The likelihood of getting a deal done remains uncertain, with sides still far apart on key issues, the people said. And, to be sure, EFH does not need any creditor support to file for bankruptcy, though having it would reduce the uncertainty of what would be a large and complex case. Ideally, the company would also like the support of other bondholders at EFIH. But holders of EFIH payment-in-kind notes already walked away from talks, and the second-lien bondholders are currently not restricted from trading, which limits the substance of any discussions they may have, according to two of the people close to the matter.

      " NUUK  (Reuters) - Greenland's parliament voted on Thursday to end a decades-long prohibition on mining for radioactive materials like uranium, further opening up the country to investors from Australia to China eager to tap its vast mineral resources. \n",
      " The move will not only allow the mining of uranium deposits, but also of rare earths, minerals used in 21st century products from wind turbines to hybrid cars and smart phones and that are currently mostly extracted by China. With sea ice thawing and new Arctic shipping routes opening, the former Cold War ally of the West has emerged from isolation and gained geopolitical attention from the likes of Beijing and Brussels thanks to its untapped mineral wealth. \"We cannot live with unemployment and cost of living increases while our economy is at a standstill. It is therefore necessary that we eliminate zero tolerance towards uranium now,\" Greenland Prime Minister Aleqa Hammond was quoted as saying by local newspaper Sermitsiaq during the debate. Hammond's government won the heated debate by 15-14 votes. The possibility of uranium mining has been criticized by environmental groups. Earlier, a group of non-governmental organizations warned uranium mining in Greenland could threaten the Arctic region's pristine ecological system. While Greenland is self governing, it is still a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. The former colonial ruler still has a say in security and defense issues and the uranium decision may need to be approved by the Danish parliament - possibly putting the two nations on a diplomatic collision course. \"Concrete actions on the mining and export of uranium will potentially have far-reaching implications for foreign, defense and security policies and are as such a matter for the Kingdom,\" Denmark's Minister for Trade and European affairs said in a statement after the vote in Greenland's parliament. Greenland's \"zero tolerance\" policy on mining radioactive materials is inherited from Denmark, but the island is keen to develop mining to help pay for welfare and jobs in this country with a population of around 57,000 people, mostly Inuits. Since Greenland won self-government in 2009, most politicians have aimed for growing autonomy and eventual independence. The more revenues from mining or oil, the more Greenland weans itself off Denmark's annual grant that accounts for more than half the island's budget. One rare earth deposit being explored by Australian-owned Greenland Minerals and Energy ( GGG.AX ) could be one of the largest outside China, which accounts for more than 90 percent of global production. But still, mining production could be a long way off. \"I think the Danish government is prepared for the no-tolerance to be lifted\" said Cindy Vestergaard, senior researcher at Danish Institute for International Studies. \"After that the Greenlanders and the Danes are going to start hammering all the legal aspects. We will not be mining on Friday, nor next year, or 2015.\" Separately, iron ore producer London Mining said on Thursday it had received the go-ahead from the Greenland government for a 15 million tonne (1 tonne = 1.102 metric tons) a year mine in the country, paving the way to attract partners for the project. The Isua project which will cost an estimated $2.3 billion has been controversial in Greenland as fears its construction would attract a flood of Chinese workers into the country.

      " (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) is chugging along with its turnaround, posting a quarterly profit that met Wall Street's expectations and holding to its annual forecasts as the world's largest household products maker gets a lift from cost cuts and a lower tax rate. \n",
      " Shares of P&G fell nearly 1 percent to $79.93 in morning trading on Friday. The maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent is trying to reinvigorate itself under Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley, who returned in late May to replace Bob McDonald. Lafley, who did not speak on the company's conference call on Friday, has previously said the current fiscal 2014 would be a \"transition\" year, after the \"stepping stone\" year that ended in June. He has already split P&G into four businesses, hoping the new structure will boost efficiency. \"We continue to think the appointment of Lafley is more temporary in nature, until a permanent successor can be named,\" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. She said she was \"a bit perplexed\" by P&G's decision to have Lafley participate only on certain calls and at major industry conferences as the company works to \"instill confidence and reignite its momentum.\" P&G said it still expected 5 percent to 7 percent growth in earnings per share this fiscal year, excluding restructuring charges. The company abandoned quarterly forecasts earlier this year. It still expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency changes, acquisitions and divestitures, to rise 3 percent to 4 percent this fiscal year. Regarding Lafley's absence from the call, a P&G spokesman Paul Fox said: \"This change reflects our focus on annual results and trends rather than quarterly results and is consistent with our recent move to fiscal guidance.\" SHAMPOO SHOWDOWN P&G held or increased market share in businesses that represent about two-thirds of its sales during the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said. While he said he was \"reasonably happy\" with the results, he added: \"We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more reliably.\" P&G competes against a variety of companies, including Unilever Plc ( ULVR.L ) ( UNc.AS ). On Thursday, Unilever's results suggested that its North American market share in the high-margin personal care business suffered because of promotions that P&G ran on its hair care products such as Pantene shampoo. However, Moeller refuted such assertions, saying that P&G's hair care product promotions were down from a year earlier. The company's market share in the category was flat. Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) also discussed a more promotional U.S. market when it released its results on Thursday. \"We see a different reality,\" Moeller told reporters. \"Promotion is important, and we will be competitive in our promotional activities, but it is not an area where we seek to lead.\" In North America overall, P&G's share of the volume of goods that were sold on promotions was down 7 percent from a year earlier, Moeller said. P&G said it had earned $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter ended on September 30, up from $2.81 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. Core earnings per share, which exclude restructuring charges, fell 1 percent to $1.05 and met analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2.2 percent to $21.21 billion, topping Wall Street's forecast of $21.04 billion. Organic sales rose 4 percent. Such sales were up in every category except healthcare, where they were flat, due in part to a pet food recall. The beauty business was a disappointment, with organic sales growth of just 1 percent, analysts said. P&G blamed the sluggish growth on factors such as a decrease in skin care product sales. JPMorgan analyst John Faucher said he had expected 3 percent organic sales growth in the beauty division. (Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)\n",

      " TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese industrial output is expected to have rebounded in September, fuelled by strong domestic demand and business investment, a Reuters poll showed, highlighting the strength of the economy as government policies bolster growth. \n",
      " Indicators of Labor demand, consumer spending and real estate investment next week are also likely to come in strong, showing that Japan is making steady progress towards beating deflation. \"Companies are going to start building up inventories to meet demand brought forward before the sales tax hike in April,\" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \"They will also produce more capital goods as capital expenditure plans are strong,\" he said. Industrial production is forecast to have risen 1.8 percent in September, according to the Reuters poll, following a 0.9 percent decline in August. The data is due at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday in Tokyo (1950 ET Tuesday). Manufacturers, surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, will also give forecasts for production in October and November, which will help measure how quickly output will grow as the year-end approaches. The jobs-to-applicants ratio, a measure of Labor demand, is expected to have risen to a five-year high of 0.96 in September from 0.95 in the previous month, the survey also showed. Growing demand for workers is a positive sign in Japan's battle to end 15 years of deflation as this should push wages higher and spur consumption. Household spending in September likely rose 0.5 percent from a year earlier, recovering from a 1.6 percent slide in August, the poll showed. Retail sales are forecast to have risen 1.9 percent year-on-year in September, up for the second straight month in a sign of solid consumer sentiment. The employment, household spending and retail statistics are all scheduled for release on Tuesday morning in Tokyo. Japan's property market has been another bright spot as people rush to buy homes and apartments before an increase in the sales tax in April to 8 percent from 5 percent. Data due at 2 p.m. (0100 ET) on Thursday is expected to show that housing starts jumped an annual 12.2 percent in September after a 12.0 percent rise in August. Japan's economic growth has outpaced its Group of 7 rich-country peers so far this year as stock market gains stoked personal consumption, prompting some companies in the service sector to expand payrolls. There is also growing evidence that companies are more willing to raise wages and invest in factories and equipment, two steps that many government officials say are necessary for Japan to end deflation and shift its economy into a higher gear.

      " The airline was fined for tarmac delays that took place at Chicago-O'Hare International Airport on July 13, 2012, the DOT said. The DOT rule says U.S. airlines operating domestic flights cannot let an aircraft stay on a tarmac for more than three hours without letting passengers deplane. Exceptions are allowed only for safety and if the pilot is advised by air traffic control that returning to the terminal would disrupt airport operations. The DOT said the 13 tarmac delays exceeded the three-hour limit for the delays by two to 77 minutes for United and its United Express code-share affiliates. These delays were due to severe thunderstorms and lightning that caused several ramp closures and disrupted the movement of aircraft at O'Hare, the agency said. The government agency said the airline will pay the United States $475,000. The remaining $625,000 will cover mitigation measures for affected passengers, and significant corrective actions by United to enhance future compliance with tarmac delay rules. \"It is unacceptable for passengers to be stranded in planes on the tarmac for hours on end,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. United Continental ( UAL.N ), the parent of United Airlines, said it was \"committed to complying with the tarmac delay regulations and we continue to improve our procedures while maintaining the safety of our customers and co-workers.\" Although United had a contingency plan for tarmac delays, the airline did not implement the plan nor contact airport personnel or other airlines for assistance during the tarmac delays, the DOT said.

      " CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Soren Schroder is shaking up Bunge Ltd ( BG.N ) five months after taking the helm of the 195-year-old agricultural trading house. \n",
      " After vowing in February that he would make no major strategy changes when he became chief executive, the company's first new leader in 14 years has said that financial results must improve and chopped capital expenditure plans. On Thursday, Schroder told a quarterly earnings call that the status quo was unacceptable for Bunge's loss-making Brazilian sugar milling business and that he will explore options, including a sale, for the business. Schroder, 52, also has ramped up discussions about share repurchases to the delight of investors who have watched as Bunge shares have failed to keep pace with those of rival Archer Daniels Midland Co ( ADM.N ). Bunge shares are up 13 percent so far this year, compared to gains of nearly 46 percent for ADM. Analysts say the changes are promising signs for Bunge, one of the world's top oilseed processors and a major agricultural force in South America. Global grain companies need aggressive management amid intense competition to feed fast-developing countries like China, they said. Bunge has launched a \"strategic shift toward a focus on returns and returning capital to shareholders,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Ken Zaslow said on Friday. \"There are initial signs that new CEO Soren Schroder appears both more inclined and more capable of returning cash to shareholders,\" Zaslow said. Schroder, who studied economics at Connecticut College, took over from Alberto Weisser, 58, as CEO on June 1. Weisser transformed Bunge into one of the world's largest agricultural trading houses from a regional operator over 14 years as CEO and will serve as executive chairman through the end of the year. Schroder's annual base salary is $1 million, compared to $1.2 million for Weisser. Like Weisser, he is eligible for substantial bonuses. A former employee of rival Cargill, Schroder joined Bunge in 2000 and led the company's North America operations for three years before becoming CEO. TEAM EFFORT Schroder, in an interview after Bunge reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday, said the company was making a team effort to improve results. Bunge reported revenue during the quarter slipped to $14.7 billion from $16.5 billion a year earlier, and came in below analysts' average forecast of $16.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \"The team is looking at the business very seriously, is committed to driving returns,\" Schroder told Reuters. \"We're being very frank about what's working and what's not.\" Schroder cut capital expenditure plans for 2014 to $900 million after reducing plans for 2013 by 16 percent to $1 billion. He said the company would postpone projects, such as expanding oilseed processing in China, with the goal of \"buying time to grow into our own capacity.\" North America and Brazil remain two areas of focus for growth because acquisitions would be \"natural add-ons\" to Bunge's food and ingredients business in the regions, Schroder said. In North America, Bunge is open to adding rice, wheat and corn mills, he said. Bunge on Wednesday said it struck a deal to buy Grupo Altex wheat mills in Mexico for an undisclosed amount. MAKING HIS MARK Bunge Chief Financial Officer Drew Burke told analysts on Thursday that share repurchasing was \"very much on our agenda,\" although no specific new program has been announced. Bunge initiated a $700 million program to buy back shares in 2010. The company expanded the program to $950 million in 2012 and extended its duration indefinitely. It has used about $450 million of the $950 million so far. \"There's been a lot of talk about return of capital and probably more than the last several years combined,\" said Ari Gendason, managing principal for Arlon Group, a New York-based firm that invests in agricultural commodities and owns Bunge shares. Schroder \"has the benefit of knowing the culture and the people and the operations but also saying I'm going to put my own mark on this as CEO,\" Gendason said.

      " NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) breached a derivative agreement with a Black Diamond Capital Management unit and must return an estimated $297 million in collateral to the hedge fund, a divided New York state appeals court ruled on Thursday. \n",
      " Barclays said on Friday it disagreed with the decision and was considering an appeal against it. The Connecticut-based fund's BDC Finance LLC filed a lawsuit against Barclays in 2008, claiming it had defaulted on a $40 million collateral call made at the height of the financial crisis. Barclays disagreed with that amount, asserting it owed only $5 million, which it remitted to Black Diamond two days after the call was made. Black Diamond then declared Barclays in default. Last year, Justice Eileen Bransten in state Supreme Court in Manhattan dismissed a portion of Black Diamond's breach of contract claim while allowing the rest of the lawsuit to proceed. However, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, a mid-level appeals court, reversed that ruling in a 3-2 decision on Thursday. The court found Barclays breached the contract both by not making the $5 million payment on time and by failing to follow the contract's procedures for disputing a collateral call, which required the bank to pay the full $40 million amount before disputing it. \"The evidence in the record undeniably shows that Barclays failed to pay the undisputed amount by the deadline, and establishes as a matter of law that Barclays did not comply with the (contract's) dispute resolution process,\" the three-judge majority wrote. With Barclays in default, Black Diamond had the right to terminate the agreement and demand a return of its entire collateral, which the fund has estimated at $297 million, the court said. Two judges, however, dissented from the court's opinion, arguing that there were questions of fact over whether Barclays disputed the $40 million call in a timely fashion. \"We are disappointed with and disagree with the court's decision. We are evaluating our options with respect to an appeal,\" a spokesman for Barclays said. An appeal would be to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals. Craig Newman, a lawyer for Black Diamond, declined to comment. Barclays Chief Executive Antony Jenkins is trying to repair the bank's image after a string of scandals, but is being dogged by legacy issues as his bank remains embroiled in several legal disputes or regulatory investigations. It was the first bank to be fined for attempted manipulation of Libor interest rates, and Britain's financial regulator and fraud office are investigating the circumstances around a controversial fundraising from Qatari investors in 2008. The bank is also fighting a $453 million fine imposed by U.S. energy regulator FERC in July, relating to power trading in the western United States from 2006 to 2008. The Black Diamond deal was signed in 2005. The total return swap transferred the benefits and risks of an investment in a Barclays-held portfolio of corporate debt instruments to Black Diamond in exchange for financing fees paid to the bank. The contract allowed each side to make collateral demands on the other based on changes to the value of the underlying loans. The case is BDC Finance v. Barclays Bank, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, No. 9906. (The story corrects fifth paragraph to show that the lower court dismissed only a portion of Black Diamond's breach of contract claim.)

      "-- Fri Oct 25, 2013 5:22pm EDT\n",

      "\n",
      " BEIJING  (Reuters) - Sinopec Group wants to sell half of its two biggest shale gas fields in Canada to spread costs and accelerate their development as the Chinese energy company focuses increasingly on return of investment, an executive said. \n",
      " The sale of an overseas asset would be a rare move for one of China's state-owned energy companies, which have spent hundreds of billions of dollars investing in hydrocarbon resources from North America to Australia to secure China's energy supply, often to hostile reaction. Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver told Reuters in Ottawa that Sinopec's stance shows \"a state-owned enterprise that is acting like a commercial operation\": buying, selling or bringing in partners when appropriate. Sinopec would join a number of other companies seeking partners in the shale regions of Western Canada, in what has become a buyer's market, albeit a popular one because the high-value shale gas is likely to soon find a ready market in Asia. \"We are not only buyers, but also actively seek joint-venture partners to optimize assets,\" said Feng Zhiqiang, newly appointed chairman of North America operations at Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp, Sinopec Group's main acquisition vehicle. \"There is no such thing that a state-owned company's job is only to obtain resources. Scale is important, profitable scale is more so,\" Feng told Reuters in an interview. Sinopec Group, the parent of top Asian refiner Sinopec Corp, is looking for an equal equity partner for Montney and Duvernay, two Western Canadian shale gas plays totaling some 500,000 acres (2,000 sq. km). They are operated by Daylight Energy, which Sinopec acquired in 2011 for more than $2 billion and later expanded. A sale could be viewed positively in Canada, where a landmark $15.1 billion acquisition of domestic company Nexen by state-owned Chinese oil firm CNOOC Ltd generated intense political debate and a policy backlash that centered in part on whether state-owned firms would follow market signals like normal commercial companies. Oliver, who visited China earlier this month, said he got no sense of a diminished interest in Canada's resources. \"There was a lot interest and enthusiasm for our resources and investing in resource sectors in Canada at the very highest level in the government, right up to and including the president (Xi Jinping),\" Oliver said. \"The president commented (that) ...there is a real complementarity between our countries' strategic interests, particularly in the energy sector. We need to diversify our markets. It's a strategic imperative. And they want to diversify their sources of supply and want to make investments in that context as well.\" STEPPING UP EXPANSION Feng declined to give a price tag for the stakes in the acreage but said their combined recoverable reserves were in the range of tens of trillions cubic feet. Thanks to successful exploration and a low purchase price, Sinopec has boosted the value of Montney \"many times over\", but the cost of the drilling to monetize the unconventional resource is too heavy for Sinopec to handle alone, said Feng. Sinopec wants to remain the operator. Sinopec, which supplies nearly half of the Chinese oil market, has so far spent $10 billion in Canada, around 14 percent of its total overseas investments. It pumps an oil equivalent of 3.5 million tonnes a year, or 70,000 barrels per day, from its two main acquisitions there -shale gas-focused Daylight Energy, and a 9.03 percent stake in heavy oil producer Syncrude. That is a fraction of the nearly 5 million barrels a day Sinopec buys on the international market for Chinese refineries. As a result of very high development costs and weak gas prices following the U.S. shale boom, Sinopec's Syncrude operations have so far generated returns below expectations, and Daylight is still seeing negative cash flows, Feng said. Despite that, Sinopec wants to accelerate expansion over the next few years in Canada, potentially a major and stable supplier to China, which overtook the United States last month as the world's top net oil importer. Canada holds the world's third-largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Sinopec also hopes to be a sizeable gas player in Canada, building on the Daylight business and targeting annual capacity of 10 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas by around 2020 to help feed China's rapidly growing demand for the cleaner fuel. \"There are few other pairs of countries like Canada and China that best complement each other,\" Feng said. But regulatory hurdles and lack of key infrastructure may hinder the growth of the Canadian energy sector, he said. The Canadian government has raised the bar for future acquisitions of its vast oil sands reserves by state-owned enterprises, limiting them to being minority stake holders. Sinopec also holds a 5 percent stake in Enbridge Inc's planned $5.8 billion Northern Gateway pipeline, which would take oil sands crude from Edmonton, Alberta, to the Pacific Coast port of Kitimat, British Columbia. The line is awaiting a final decision from federal regulators, expected by yearend. But the provincial government of British Columbia is wary, and the project faces solid opposition from environmental groups and aboriginal communities. Changing market conditions have brought Sinopec many takeover targets, but it will be picky and aim for \"fair price\" deals, Feng said. \"Many companies are chasing us as a lot of oil sands and gas companies are in financial difficulties. But most of them still have very high expectations and believe that Chinese or Asian companies are ready to pay significant premiums,\" he said. Talisman Energy Inc, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, Athabasca Oil Corp and others are already looking partners for their holdings in the Montney and Duvernay shale gas regions. The two regions have become attractive to the oil industry despite low natural gas prices. Not only will the gas from the regions' fields find a ready market in Asia once planned LNG plants are completed on the British Columbia coast, but the regions also contain millions of barrels of high-value natural-gas liquids such as ethane and propane.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment dropped in October to its lowest level since the end of last year as consumers worried congressional dysfunction and the resulting partial shutdown of the federal government would hurt growth, a survey released on Friday showed. \n",
      " The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment fell to 73.2 in October from 77.5 in September and was the lowest final reading since December 2012. The October figure was lower than both the 75.0 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and the mid-month preliminary reading of 75.2. \"Not too pretty but not a disaster after all,\" said Yelena Shulyatyeva, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York. Fiscal fights in Congress \"took their toll,\" with a drumbeat of negative news eroding sentiment. The federal government shut down for 16 days in the first half of October as Republicans in Congress sought to undermine President Barack Obama's signature health care law as a condition of funding the government. The government also came close to breaching its borrowing limit, which compounded the crisis and could have pushed the country closer to a historic debt default. While a last-minute agreement averted that outcome by raising the debt ceiling until early next year, rating agency Fitch warned it could still cut the U.S. sovereign credit rating because of the political brinkmanship. \"When asked to describe in their own words what they had heard about recent economic developments, the number of consumers that negatively mentioned the federal government in October was the highest in the more than half-century history of the surveys,\" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. Other gauges also hit multi-month lows. The index of consumer expectations, at 62.5, hit its lowest since November 2011, and the index of current conditions, at 89.9, hit its lowest since April. The debt impasse likely affected economic growth in the quarter, with Standard & Poor's estimating the shutdown took $24 billion out of the world's biggest economy. The one-year inflation expectation fell to 3.0 percent from 3.3 percent while the five-to-10-year inflation outlook edged down to 2.8 percent from 3.0 percent. The sliding consumer confidence could in turn affect holiday spending - especially as the Congressional deal is only a temporary fix, which could see renewed fiscal debates toward year-end. \"I really hope the holiday season will be okay,\" Shulyatyeva said. \"This is really bad timing.\" (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and  Chizu Nomiyama )\n"

      " SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) has secured commitments for around 200 of its 737 Max aircraft, the upgraded variant of its best-selling short-haul planes, from multiple Chinese customers, said two sources familiar with the deals. \n",
      " The deals are worth a combined $20.7 billion at list prices and must be approved by the Chinese government, a usual practice for aircraft orders in the country, before the customers can be identified, the sources said. These are the first commitments for the 737 Max from China, the world's fastest-growing airline market. Officials from both Boeing and Airbus ( EAD.PA ), which makes the A320 that competes with the 737, have said China is likely to overtake the United States as the world's largest market over the next 20 years. The commitments come from a range of customers including state-owned airlines via the national procurement agency, China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, as well as leasing firms associated with the country's banks, the sources said. China Aviation Supplies could not be immediately reached for comment. Airlines such as Air China ( 601111.SS ), China Eastern Airlines ( 600115.SS ) and China Southern Airlines ( 600029.SS ) are all operators of the current models of the 737 in the country. Committing to the aircraft while waiting for the government to approve their fleet growth plans allow the airlines to secure some of the earlier delivery slots for the 737 Max, for which there have been 1,567 orders. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the deal, and would only say, \"discussions with customers are confidential.\" The 737 Max has been upgraded with new CFM Leap engines, and has several other enhancements that make it a more fuel-efficient aircraft than the existing models. CFM is a joint venture between GE Aviation ( GE.N ) and Snecma. Boeing said in a report in August that there are 1,650 single-aisle aircraft in China, with existing orders for another 700. These fly on domestic and regional routes of up to five hours. The planemaker also forecast that China will take delivery of 3,900 single-aisle aircraft over the next 20 years. The 737 Max competes with the Airbus A320 neo, the re-engined variant of the European planemaker's popular single-aisle aircraft. Airbus said last month it has commitments for 100 A320 neo, including 60 from flag carrier Air China and 20 from leasing firm ICBC Leasing. China is also developing its own single-aisle narrow-body aircraft, the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) C919, to compete with the A320 and 737. The first flight has been delayed to 2015, with the deliveries not expected to begin until a few years after that. (Editing by Ryan Woo)\n",

      " SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Twitter is preparing to sell 70 million shares to the public in an IPO that will value the company at $10.9 billion. Below is a list of the number of shares owned by some of the people and investment firms that will benefit most from the offering: \n",
      " Executive officers and directors: Evan Williams, 56,909,847 shares, or 12 percent. Williams was Twitter's CEO until 2010, when current chief Dick Costolo took the helm. He is now working on a publishing platform, Medium, dedicated to long-form content. Williams will have a 10.4 percent stake after selling shares in the IPO, according to the company's most recent prospectus. Jack Dorsey, 23,453,017 shares, or 4.9 percent. Dorsey co-founded Twitter and still serves as its chairman. In 2009, he founded payments service Square and serves as its CEO. Dorsey will have a 4.3 percent stake after the IPO. Dick Costolo, 7,675,239 shares, or 1.6 percent. A onetime improvisational comedian, Costolo took the helm of Twitter in 2010. He joined Twitter as COO the year before, after he and co-founders sold their web feed management provider FeedBurner to Google in 2007. Costolo will have a 1.4 percent stake after the offering. Adam Bain, 1,785,818 shares, or less than 1 percent. Bain is the president of global revenue at Twitter. He was formerly the president of audience network at News Corp's Fox Interactive Media. David Rosenblatt, 291,666 shares, or less than 1 percent. Rosenblatt is the CEO of luxury online retailer 1stdibs.com and is a member of Twitter's board of directors. The following groups own at least 5 percent: Rizvi Traverse Management and affiliates, 85,171,093 shares, or 17.9 percent. A closely held private-equity fund based in Michigan, Rizvi has made a name for itself by buying stakes in entertainment companies such as Playboy and movie producer Summit Entertainment. Last year, it led a $200 million funding round in Jack Dorsey's payments company, Square. The group will have a 15.6 percent stake in Twitter after the IPO. Spark Capital and affiliates, 32,414,224 shares, or 6.8 percent. Venture firm Spark started investing in Twitter in 2008. For a time, Spark partner Bijan Sabet served on Twitter's board. The group will have a 6 percent stake after the IPO. Benchmark, 31,567,052 shares, or 6.6 percent.

      " (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) said on Thursday that it was cutting up to 4,000 mortgage jobs as fewer borrowers refinance, and fewer home loans go bad. \n",
      " The layoffs are the latest round of job cuts at major banks as rising mortgage rates cut into demand for refinancing home loans. Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) have announced thousands of layoffs among them in recent months. At Bank of America, the third largest U.S. mortgage lender, about 1,200 employees were notified this week that they would be terminated. Most were full-time workers in the division that processes new mortgages, a spokesman said. Before the end of the year, the bank is looking to cut another 2,800 jobs in the division that collects payments from borrowers who are behind, a spokesperson added. Most of the layoffs in that division will affect contractors. Five years after the financial crisis, many of the loans that should never have been made have already gone bad, leaving banks with fewer troubled loans to manage. For Bank of America, mortgage loans that were delinquent by more than 60 days fell by 94,000 to 398,000 in the third quarter. The bank expects a further decline to below 375,000 by the end of 2013. Mortgage lending volume at Bank of America was down 11 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter. The number of applications the bank had received but not yet processed was down 60 percent in the end of September from the end of June. The bank expects to make fewer home loans in the fourth quarter and will look to cut more mortgage jobs, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said during an October 16 quarterly conference call with analysts. The job cuts at the bank follow another round of layoffs-- in the third quarter, the second-largest U.S. bank eliminated more than 9,000 full-time positions, or 3.6 percent of its total staff. Finance chief Bruce Thompson said on the October 16 call that the reductions were concentrated in the unit that collects payments on home loans, the unit that makes new home loans, and in many of the bank's branches. A majority of the latest cuts will affect employees based in California, Texas and Florida. News of the layoffs was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. HIGHER RATES SLOW REFINANCING Rising interest rates have weighed on mortgage refinancing at banks since the spring. The average interest rate on a prime 30-year mortgage stood at 4.39 percent in the week that ended Friday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), down from a high of 4.80 percent in September but above the 3.59 percent rate in early May. With rates having recently come down from their September highs, demand for refinancing has increased by one third, and overall mortgage applications are up by 18 percent, according to MBA data. But even with that pick-up, applications are down by 52 percent from their level in early May. With these declines, Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said on October 17 that it was cutting 925 mortgage jobs. That is in addition to the 5,300 Wells Fargo mortgage employees who were notified that they would be laid off in the third quarter. Bank of America was the third-largest U.S. mortgage lender in the first six months of 2013, making 5.2 percent of all U.S. home loans, following JPMorgan Chase, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended at another record high on Friday, boosted by gains in technology shares after strong results from Microsoft and Amazon.com. \n",
      " They were the latest to offer some upbeat news on the earnings season, which has been mixed overall, especially on the revenue side where the percentage of companies beating analysts' expectations has been below the long-term average. Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) gave the biggest boost to all three major indexes, while Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) also helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Microsoft shares jumped 6 percent at $35.73, a day after it reported profit and revenue above analysts' expectations. Amazon.com shares rose as high as $368.40, a record, after the online retailer reported stronger-than-expected sales growth. Shares ended up 9.4 percent at $363.39. The S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT rose 0.4 percent. The market has risen following last week's legislation to avoid a U.S. debt default and end a partial government shutdown, as well as increased speculation the Federal Reserve will delay scaling back its stimulus for several months. The S&P 500 had hit record finishes for four sessions until Wednesday. \"It seems like good news is being responded to very well and bad news is just seen as more evidence the Fed won't be able to tighten anytime soon,\" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The S&P 500 is up 23.4 percent so far this year, just shy of the 23.5 percent gain it posted in 2009. Surpassing the 2009 record would give the index its biggest annual gain in a decade. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 61.07 points, or 0.39 percent, at 15,570.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  ended up 7.7 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,759.77, and hit an intraday record high of 1,759.82 late in the session. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 14.40 points, or 0.37 percent, at 3,943.36. Indexes also posted gains for the week. The Dow rose 1.1 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent and Nasdaq 0.7 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks .TOY registered its eighth week of gains, its longest streak since 2003. Based on results so far and estimates for companies still to report, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have risen just 3.4 percent in the third quarter, with 69 percent of companies reporting earnings above analysts' expectations. Revenue growth is seen at 2.2 percent for the quarter, with just 54.2 percent beating sales estimates, below the long-term average of 61 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed. Among other earnings, United Parcel Service's ( UPS.N ) stock hit a record at $96.94 after the company posted a bigger quarterly profit and said it expects online sales to boost holiday volume. Shares ended up 1.2 percent at $95.61. Also, Zynga ( ZNGA.O ) late Thursday said it expects a full-year profit after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results. Shares jumped 5.5 percent to $3.729. Dow component DuPont ( DD.N ) jumped to the highest in more than 13 years, a day after announcing it will spin off its titanium dioxide unit within 18 months. Shares rose 0.8 percent to $61.90. The day's economic data overall pointed to more signs that the recent budget battle in Washington has held back the economy. New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods outside of transportation equipment fell in September, possibly due to uncertainty over government spending. U.S. consumer sentiment dropped in October to its lowest level since the end of last year as consumers worried congressional dysfunction. (Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n",

      " FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ) could seek a partner to set up steel processing in Brazil if it fails to sell its steel mill in the Latin American country, the Wall Street Journal Deutschland reported, citing sources. \n",
      " ThyssenKrupp has for more than a year been trying to offload its Steel Americas business, comprising the steel slab-producing mill in Brazil and a rolling mill in Alabama. The Brazil plant has the capacity to produce up to 5 million tonnes of slab a year, part of which is sold to the Alabama mill for processing into flat products shipped mostly to carmakers. A new processing plant in Brazil could take up the output of slabs that ThyssenKrupp can no longer ship to its plant in Alabama if it finds a buyer for only the U.S. plant, the WSJ Deutschland said. ThyssenKrupp reiterated that it was in \"far advanced\" talks with one bidder over the sale of both Steel Americas plants and aimed to strike a deal soon. It is also in talks with other interested parties, it said, without providing details. ThyssenKrupp owns 73 percent of the plant in Brazil, called CSA, while the rest belongs to Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ). A source familiar with the situation told Reuters last month that ThyssenKrupp could give up trying to sell the plant in Brazil, having made no progress in sales negotiations with Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) ( CSNA3.SA ). A move to process CSA's slabs in Brazil rather than in the United States may also have further financial implications as Brasilia passed a series of tax breaks in 2005 that benefited companies exporting at least 80 percent of their output.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve meeting next week is not on the minds of as many people as when it met in September, but its decision to do nothing last month is providing the fuel for more share gains in Apple and Facebook, which report results next week. \n",
      " Facebook is only slightly off an all-time high, and Apple has recovered somewhat from losses earlier in the year after investors have poured money back into stocks, bringing the S&P to successive records that some say may not be supported by corporate results. The numbers from Facebook ( FB.O ) and Apple ( AAPL.O ) are among those that will be closely watched - and investors say at their current levels, the margin for error is slim. Nearly half of the S&P 500 companies have reported their third-quarter results so far, and 69 percent have beaten Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. The technology sector has led the way, beating expectations 84 percent of the time. The most recent companies to do so were Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ), whose results led the S&P to close at an all-time high of 1,759.79 on Friday. Companies already stretched to high price-to-earnings multiples, like Facebook, will have to outpace expectations to keep investors buying. \"There is not a lot of room for error, especially with these names with a lot of momentum behind them. You have to beat the numbers pretty handily,\" said Daniel Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, who focuses on tech stocks. That's where the Fed comes in. Some of the riskier names and high-dividend payers had pulled back in the late summer, anticipating the Fed would begin reducing monthly bond purchases beginning at its September meeting. But that didn't happen - and since then, stocks have been unimpeded, save for the 16-day government shutdown that didn't scare too many people. The Federal Reserve will hold its October meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. But earnings will overshadow the central bank, as it is expected to maintain its current policy, in part because of the economic hit that resulted from the shutdown. \"So far, this earnings season has been pretty balanced and on the positive side,\" said Paul Mangus, head of equity strategy and research for Wells Fargo Private Bank in Charlotte, N.C. \"If that continues into next week, and we're not expecting anything surprising out of the Fed, it could continue to support markets on current levels.\" Mangus noted that expectations for the third quarter were low, so beating earnings estimates is not a particularly bold sign of strength. Many companies were able to create earnings without actual revenue growth, so 46 percent of results so far revealed lower-than-expected revenue growth. \"The sales numbers have been anemic. We're pretty flat in terms of across the board revenue,\" Mangus said. For the past week, the Dow was up 1.1 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.7 percent. TECH: A BIG ACT TO FOLLOW About 24 percent of S&P 500 companies will report their third-quarter earnings next week, among them heavy hitters such as General Motors ( GM.N ) and Visa ( V.N ). But Apple, reporting on Monday, and Facebook, on Wednesday, are likely to be the most-watched names. \"These are big names that people like to look at and they create a feeling about the market,\" said Synovus Trust's Morgan. He said he will be looking to see if Apple has reversed the negative trend in iPad sales of the second quarter. But, he noted, Apple's multiple is low, at a 12.25 price-to-earnings forward ratio, compared with Facebook, which has a 55.45 P/E multiple. Right now, the market is optimistic, particularly for Facebook options. That market is pricing in more upside risk than downside risk for Facebook shares heading into earnings next week. A metric known as skew, which measures the perceived volatility priced into out-of-the-money puts versus out-of-the-money calls on a stock, is inverted - meaning it costs more for options that anticipate upside rather than downside. \"This is the opposite of what we typically see in the stock market, since most investors are long stocks and therefore more concerned about downside risk,\" said Matt Franz, at Stutland Volatility Group in Chicago. ENERGY TURNS UP THE HEAT Second only to technology, the energy sector of the S&P 500 has beaten analysts' earnings expectations in 73 percent of the results reported so far. The focus will stay on the group next week, with results from Exxon ( XOM.N ) , Chevron ( CVX.N ) and Valero ( VLO.N ). As a cyclical sector tied to the pace of economic growth, \"better earnings and especially better guidance ... are going to say good things about the economy going forward,\" said Tom Schrader, managing director of U.S. trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets, who focuses on energy stocks. Forward guidance from refiners may be positive if companies price in news that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is considering lowering the required amount of ethanol to be blended into engine fuels, said Schrader. If the government's September jobs number was any indication, economic data that is relatively within expectations, even if weak, will fuel investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep stimulating the economy at current levels. ADP's national employment report, due on Wednesday, will show the number of non-farm private sector jobs added to payrolls in October. Unlike the Department of Labor's October jobs report, ADP will not account for public sector jobs that were temporarily lost during the partial government shutdown. If it did, that might present a clearer picture of the nation's employment rate. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, to be released on Tuesday, will account for the government shutdown and reveal how big a hit U.S. spending habits took as a result.

      " TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank less than initially estimated in the fourth quarter as companies ramped up capital expenditure, but the current account swung to a record deficit in January as a shift away from nuclear power pushes up fossil fuel imports. \n",
      " The revision to GDP showed a 0.2 percent contraction, bang in line with the median market forecast as companies look to an increase in demand due to reconstruction of the country's tsunami-battered northeast coast. The current account balance also took a hit in January because Chinese Lunar New Year holiday weighed on exports, but economists see the result as a one-off and expect annual current account to remain in surplus for the next few years. The figures on GDP could be a welcome sign for Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda as he tries to muster support for next fiscal year's budget and a controversial plan to double the 5 percent sales tax. \"The economy will resume growing in the first quarter as exports increase and as rebuilding after the earthquake proceeds. The economic recovery will continue into the new fiscal year starting from April,\" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, chief economist at Shinkin Asset Management Co in Tokyo. \"There are a lot of risk factors, such as a strong yen and Europe's debt crisis, but these risks have been receding.\" <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ GDP in Japan, U.S., Europe  link.reuters.com/tys56s Current account, exports  link.reuters.com/cec56s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> On an annualized basis, the economy shrank 0.7 percent, also in line with forecasts, and less than a preliminary 2.3 percent annualized contraction, the Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday. JPGDR1=ECI Capital expenditure, the main driver of the upward revisions, rose 4.8 percent, slightly less than a 5.0 percent rise expected by economists, but well ahead of a preliminary reading of a 1.9 percent rise. Larger-than-expected gains in industrial production and bullish output forecasts for the first quarter have raised hopes that Japan's economy will gather momentum this year. Japan's current account balance swung to a record deficit of 437.3 billion yen ($5.41 billion)in January, deeper than the median estimate for a 317.8 billion yen deficit. Japan logged its first shortfall since January 2009 due to a gaping trade deficit as exports plunged on holiday-thinned Chinese demand while higher fuel costs and nuclear plant shutdowns after last year's earthquake pushed up energy imports. The yen slipped to trade at 81.26 per dollar as a current account deficit raises doubts about how long Japan will be able to fund its large public debt domestically. Economists say it may be some time before Japan consistently runs a deficit in its current account given the income generated on investments overseas. \"The trade balance is likely to stay in deficit this year as we import more energy to offset the declining use of nuclear power,\" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities Research & Consulting. \"The current account should swing back to a surplus as we still have a surplus in the income account. Japan should be able to finance its debt for the time being. But if it is a question of what happens five to 10 years from now, we cannot be so certain.\" The Bank of Japan is likely to leave monetary policy unchanged at its next meeting on March 12-13. The BOJ surprised markets on February 14 by easing monetary policy with a 10 trillion yen ($123.86 billion) increase in government bond purchases and set an inflation goal of 1 percent, signaling more vigorous efforts to end deflation.

      " TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank less than initially estimated in the fourth quarter as companies ramped up capital expenditure in response to an increase in demand spurred by reconstruction of the country's earthquake-battered northeast coast. \n",
      " The current account balance swung to a record deficit in January as the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays weighed on exports, but economists see the result as a one-off and expect the current account to remain in surplus for the next few years. ************************************************************* KEY POINTS: -- Gross domestic product (GDP) fell a revised 0.2 percent in October-December from the previous quarter, exactly in line with economists' median forecast and revised from the government's preliminary estimate of a 0.6 percent contraction, according to Cabinet Office data on Thursday. -- On an annualized basis, the economy shrank 0.7 percent, matching a 0.7 percent annualized decline expected by economists and revised from a preliminary 2.3 percent annualized contraction. JPGDR1=ECI -- Capital expenditure rose a revised 4.8 percent, compared with a 5.0 percent rise expected by economists and a preliminary reading of a 1.9 percent rise. -- Japan's current account balance swung to a deficit of 437.3 billion yen ($5.41 billion) in January, more than the median estimate for a record 317.8 billion yen deficit as exports sank at the start of the year. JPCURA=ECI COMMENTARY: NORIO MIYAGAWA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES RESEARCH & CONSULTING, TOKYO \"The upward revision in capital expenditure explains the revision to GDP. From here on, exports won't be too strong because overseas economies are slowing. \"Factory output will rebound, however, as the impact from floods in Thailand is receding and domestic subsidies for energy-efficient goods will help the economy. Reconstruction-related demand will also play a part. \"The trade balance is likely to stay in deficit this year as we import more energy to offset the declining use of nuclear power. \"The current account should swing back to a surplus as we still have a surplus in the income account. Japan should be able to finance its debt for the time being. But if it is a question of what happens five to 10 years from now, we cannot be so certain.\" TAKESHI MINAMI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NORINCHUKIN RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO \"Capital expenditure growth is accelerating, but overall, the revised GDP figures were within expectations. \"We cannot count on any strong growth in exports, but as a whole, we'll probably see positive economic growth in the first quarter of this year. Public expenditure growth will also support the economy in April-June, so the economy will likely expand solidly in the new business year from April, once exports bottom out. \"The Bank of Japan acted boldly last month, so it will probably stand pat next week.\" HIROSHI MIYAZAKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SHINKIN ASSET MANAGEMENT CO, TOKYO \"The economy will resume growing in the first quarter as exports increase and as rebuilding proceeds after the earthquake. The economic recovery will continue into the new fiscal year starting from April. \"There are a lot of risk factors, such as a strong yen and Europe's debt crisis, but these risks have been receding. \"A weakening yen will help corporate earnings. Consumption is likely to improve. Companies will also think twice about delaying domestic capital expenditure.\" BACKGROUND: -- The Bank of Japan is likely to leave monetary policy unchanged at its next meeting on March 12-13. The BOJ surprised markets on February 14 by easing monetary policy with a 10 trillion yen ($123.86 billion) increase in government bond purchases and set an inflation goal of 1 percent, signaling a more aggressive stance to end deflation. -- The yen has since slipped and is now trading near a nine-month low versus the dollar, going some way to easing concerns that a strong currency could weigh on exports and delay Japan's economic recovery. -- Larger-than-expected gains in industrial production and bullish output forecasts for the first quarter have raised hopes that Japan's economy will gather momentum this year.

      " ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece secured an overwhelming acceptance of a bond swap offer to private creditors and beat its own most optimistic forecasts, a senior official said on Thursday after the deadline expired on a deal needed to avoid a chaotic debt default. \n",
      " A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said take-up on the offer was around 95 percent an hour before the offer closed at 2000 GMT with responses still coming in. The biggest sovereign debt restructuring in history will see bond holders accept losses of some 74 percent on the value of their investments in a deal that will cut more than 100 billion euros from Greece's crippling public debt. Preliminary results from the offer are expected to be announced officially at 0600 GMT on Friday and Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos will hold a news conference before a call with euro zone finance ministers in the afternoon. After initial fears that the deal could fail altogether, pitching Greece and the euro zone into fresh crisis, the unexpectedly strong result may mean that Athens can avoid enforcing the exchange on recalcitrant holdouts. The government had been expected to activate so-called collective action clauses (CACs) on all 177 billion euros worth of bonds regulated under Greek law. That would potentially trigger payouts on the credit default swaps (CDS) that some investors held on the bonds, an event which would have unknown consequences for the market. The private sector involvement (PSI) deal is a key element in a broader international bailout aimed at averting a chaotic default by Greece and a potentially disastrous banking crisis across the euro zone. The European Union and International Monetary Fund have made a successful bond swap a pre-condition for final approval of the 130 billion euros ($170 billion) bailout agreed last month. \"If all goes well, tomorrow we will be able to announce that a debt burden of 105 billion euros has been lifted from the Greek people,\" Venizelos told parliament earlier in the day. \"For the first time we are cutting debt instead of adding to it.\" OPTIMISM Despite the apparent success, the deal will not solve Greece's deep-seated problems and at best it may buy time for a country facing its biggest economic crisis since World War Two and staggering under debt equal to 160 percent of its gross domestic product. However financial markets rose strongly as the threat of an immediate and uncontrolled default receded. Bank stocks rose sharply and the risk premium on Italian and Spanish government bonds fell as investors hoped a Greek deal would curb the likelihood of any contagion spreading to other weaker euro zone economies. Euro zone ministers could decide whether to clear the overall bailout package in their conference call on Friday afternoon, although they may leave the final decision until a face-to-face meeting on Monday. Athens must have the funds in place by March 20 when some 14.5 billion euros of bonds are due, which it cannot hope to repay alone. Greece has staggered from deadline to deadline since the crisis broke two years ago and several of its international partners have expressed open doubts about whether its second major bailout in two years will be the last. Underlining the severe problems facing Greece after five years of deep recession, data on Thursday showed unemployment running at a record 21 percent in December, twice the euro zone average, with 51 percent of young people without a job. There has been growing resentment over the austerity medicine ordered by international creditors which has compounded the pain from a slump which has seen the economy shrink by a fifth since 2008. But Greece, totally reliant on international support to stave off bankruptcy, has also infuriated both the European Union and the International Monetary Fund with its repeated failure to push through promised reforms. \"We have shown a lot of solidarity with Greece,\" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said late on Wednesday. \"Everyone knows that the real problems of Greek society are in Greece and not abroad.\" ($1 = 0.7625 euros) (Additional reporting by Harry Papachristou and Angeliki Koutantou and Aloisio Alves in Rio di Janaeiro; writing by  James Mackenzie ; editing by  Jon Boyle )\n",

      " (Reuters) - Suntech Power Holdings STP.N and JinkoSolar Holding Co ( JKS.N ) became the latest solar companies to record big impairment charges, as losses mount on weak demand and a steep fall in prices. \n",
      " The solar industry was hit hard last year as prices for the equipment that turns sunlight into electricity halved, pushing many companies into losses and forcing the likes of First Solar ( FSLR.O ), SolarWorld AG ( SWVG.DE ), MEMC Electronic Materials WFR.N and Yingli Green Energy ( YGE.N ) to incur huge charges. Suntech, the world's biggest producer of photovoltaic solar panels, said on Thursday its operating expenses in the third quarter included non-cash, impairment charges of $482.9 million, while JinkoSolar took a $7.3 million hit in the fourth quarter. \"Due to the challenging solar market conditions and the significant reduction in the company's market capitalization in the third quarter of 2011, Suntech initiated an assessment of its goodwill, intangibles, and certain investments,\" the company said in a statement. Given the reduced profitability of solar companies, more writedowns could be expected this year, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jeff Osborne said. Suntech shares have lost 69 percent of their value in the last one year, while JinkoSolar shares have shed about three-quarters of their value. This compares with a 66 percent decline in the broader MAC Global Solar Energy Index .SUNIDX. JinkoSolar shares fell as much as 12 percent on Thursday morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Suntech shares fell 4 percent. \"I don't expect to see a broad recovery by the end of this year, even if the end market grows significantly,\" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Ben Schuman said. TRADE WAR To add to Chinese solar companies' growing worries is a trade war that could see the United States imposing tariffs on imports from the Asian country. Germany's SolarWorld's U.S. subsidiary and six anonymous peers filed a trade complaint in October, contending that China's support of its solar companies breached global trade rules and that those companies were dumping equipment in the U.S. market below the cost of production. The Chinese manufacturers have denied the charges, but many are preparing for Washington to impose tariffs. \"Our market size of course has the potential to be impacted by the outcome of the petition to impose tariffs on China-made solar cells,\" Suntech Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Beebe said on a conference call with analysts. \"Ironically this case was entered by SolarWorld, a German company who has avoided providing any information on the extraordinary amount of subsidies from Germany, U.S. and governments in the Middle East,\" Beebe said. PROFITLESS GROWTH? Suntech forecast full-year shipments of 2.1 GW to 2.5 GW, marginally higher than the 2.09 GW it shipped last year. For 2012, JinkoSolar expects total solar module shipments of 800 megawatt (MW) to 1,000 MW, higher than last year's 760.8 MW. Suntech's Beebe said the company expects growth from the United States, China, India and Japan to roughly offset decline in the European market. \"These markets are intensely competitive. So you could have a spinning wheel of volume growth for the industry offset by profitless prosperity,\" Stifel's Osborne said. However, Suntech expects first-quarter shipments to decline by about 30 percent from the fourth. \"This could be the first year that Suntech does not gain market share in the five years we've covered it,\" Raymond James analysts Pavel Molchanov and Alex Morris wrote in a note. Suntech, however, said it had seen stronger-than-expected demand from Germany as customers rushed to stock up before the world's No. 2 solar market cut its renewable energy subsidies. Germany plans to advance cuts in solar power subsidies of up to 30 percent by almost a month to March 9. Record solar installations in Germany in December surprised most in the industry, with an estimated 3 gigawatt of panels added in the world's biggest solar market. On Thursday, Suntech and JinkoSolar posted a quarterly loss. (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath and Divya Lad in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Don Sebastian)\n"

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Bankers' salaries will likely grow at the fastest rate in Asia Pacific this year, rising by twice as much in the United States, according to an industry survey, cementing the region's reputation as one of the hottest but costliest markets to hire in. \n",
      " Elsewhere, including in Europe, salaries across the financial sector are also likely to rise in 2012 but at much slower rate than in Asia and not for bank chief executives, a survey by human resources consultancy Mercer forecast. Banks with an Asian focus, such as HSBC and Standard Chartered, were hit by rising wages bills last year from expanding in the region, though strong growth there did boost revenues. Standard Chartered registered a 15 percent rise in staff costs as it competed to hire and retain executives. Mercer found that in Asia, financial services salaries were set to rise 5 percent on average in 2012, while in the United States the pay hikes would likely reach 2.5 percent and in EMEA 2 percent. The group surveyed 63 firms in December 2011, the bulk of which were banks. A quarter were insurance companies. Most of the firms it contacted in Asia Pacific were based in Hong Kong, Australia and China. Base salaries were historically never a big part of investment bankers' compensation packages, but after a post-financial crisis crackdown by regulators in Europe on bonus structures, base pay has risen dramatically. At many top investment banks, salaries doubled after 2009, with senior executives getting up to 300,000 pounds ($471,200) in base pay, according to headhunters and bankers. This has made salaries a much more important factor when it comes to retaining and recruiting staff, and international banks in Asia for instance compete with local firms on this basis. FEW BONUS CHANGES Still, bonuses remain a big focus for regulators, politicians and the media, with banks in the UK still under intense pressure to rein in rewards after several lenders were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. Bonus structures have been overhauled, with big chunks deferred and paid in shares rather than in cash upfront. Half of the firms surveyed by Mercer said they did not plan to change bonus designs in 2012. Those that do said they would review the performance measures awards are based on or introduce conditions upon which bonus can be clawed back - a feature banks are only just starting to use. Britain's Lloyds and HSBC were among those that clawed back bonuses this year in connection with mis-selling incidents. But although payout structures have changed, the size of rewards is still a contentious point, particularly in Europe, even if most investment banks, hit by turmoil in the euro zone last year, slashed bonus pools for 2011. According to Mercer, only 10 percent of firms looking at bonus changes said they were considering reducing the maximum payouts in their annual bonus plans. Banks can sometimes restrict how big a bonus is versus base pay, and tighten the criteria. But the ratio of bonuses to revenues and bonuses to pre-tax profits did fall from 2010 to 2011 at the banks that responded to Mercer's survey. The majority of financial services firms also do not plan to change their long-term incentive plans, Mercer said. Staff in so-called control roles - such as in risk management, audit and compliance - are likely to receive the biggest average pay rises in 2012, the report added. These staff could get pay rises of more than 3 percent. These roles have gained prominence as regulators have cracked down on banks and scrutinized rewards for key risk-takers.

      " DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group LLC's top executive declined a salary and bonus for a second straight year in 2011, when the Detroit automaker repaid more than $7 billion in government loans from its bankruptcy restructuring nearly three years ago. \n",
      " Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne is still compensated as CEO of Italian automaker Fiat SpA, which owns 58.5 percent of Chrysler and paid him 3.5 million euros ($4.5 million) in 2010. Chrysler did reimburse Marchionne, however, for cleaning, security and other costs at his condominium in Michigan, according to an annual regulatory filing released late Tuesday. Marchionne has been CEO of both automakers since Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy in June 2009. His hard-charging style has been credited with bringing the U.S. automaker back from the brink of collapse and reviving Wall Street's interest. Chrysler's improved financial performance pushed its value to $7.5 billion at the end of 2011, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, a 56 percent gain from its 2010 value of $4.8 billion. \"(The increase is) primarily attributable to continued improvement in our performance and achievement of the objectives outlined in our business plan,\" Chrysler said. Chrysler reported a 2011 profit of $183 million after a $652 million loss in 2010. Its U.S. auto sales jumped 24.3 percent, outpacing the industry's 10.3 percent rise, helped by the launch of 16 new and improved models. In May, Chrysler refinanced $7.6 billion of high-interest loans from the United States and Canada that were extended as part of the company's 2009 bailout. Fiat later bought the equity stakes held by the U.S. and Canadian governments. FROM DETROIT TO TURIN Chrysler, which is not public, calculated the valuation to set compensation for some of its top executives, including Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer and General Counsel Holly Leese, the annual filing said. Chrysler said the value of each \"unit\" of the company, calculated from a four-year projection of cash flows and other metrics, was $7.63 as of December 31. Chrysler estimated that it is made up of 980 million units on a fully diluted basis. Marchionne has shuttled between Auburn Hills, Michigan, and Fiat's headquarters in Turin, Italy, since 2009, when Fiat took management control and a one-fifth stake in Chrysler as part of the terms of the U.S. automaker's bankruptcy. Chrysler said costs on his condominium were on par with or less than what it would have cost for him to stay at hotels in the area. His 2011 pay package from Fiat has not yet been disclosed. Chrysler is now Fiat's chief source of financial strength, exceeding many analysts' expectations. Over the course of 2011 and early 2012, Fiat increased its stake in Chrysler to 58.5 percent from 20 percent. Sales to fleet customers such as rental car companies made up 27.6 percent of Chrysler's overall U.S. sales last year, down from 36.1 percent in 2010, according to the filing. Fleet sales are less profitable than retail sales to consumers. But Chrysler has also made missteps, including dull sales of the Fiat 500 small car that fell far short of U.S. targets. Chrysler's pension shortfall widened to $6.5 billion in 2011, just $1 billion less than its overall market value, due to falling interest rates. Improvements in workers' life expectancy increased the size of Chrysler's liability. Chrysler's larger rivals Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co are both exploring ways to soften their respective pension risks, which analysts say have taken a toll on their stock price.

      " HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Proview Technology, which is battling Apple over the iPad trademark in China, has asked Chinese distributors to stop selling the popular tablet PC after the U.S. technology giant launched the latest version of its iPad. \n",
      " The move is the latest twist in a long-running lawsuit between the world's most valuable technology company and the Chinese firm, a unit of near-bankrupt Proview International Holdings Ltd, but was expected to have little impact on the case. Proview Technology (Shenzhen), in an open letter to China's suppliers and resellers, urged them to immediately stop selling, storing and shipping the iPad as of Thursday, citing trademark infringement issues. \"Anybody who continues to do so will be seen as intentionally infringing rights and the company will adopt the most severe measures by taking legal action,\" Proview Technology said in the letter to iPad suppliers and resellers in China. The dispute has dented sales of the iPad in China, Apple's second largest market by revenue, and the two sides are now awaiting a key ruling by the high court in Guangzhou after a lower court ruled in favor of the Chinese firm last year. \"This is Proview's strategy to give Apple more pressure in the Chinese market, to try and add another blow to its iPad sales there,\" said Rachel He, a lawyer with the firm Guangdong Sun-Kindle. \"However, I don't think it will affect the decision of the Guangzhou high court because that ruling will be based more on the new evidence presented last week,\" she said. The Higher People's Court in Guangzhou heard Apple's appeal on February 29 and is expected to make a decision in coming weeks or months. Proview released its latest statement after Apple on Wednesday released a faster 4G version of its iPad, offering a better screen and other new features. Chinese media have reported that Proview is seeking up to 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in compensation for trade mark infringement. Proview has said it favors an out-of-court settlement, which usually involves the payment of compensation, which analysts have said the company needs to repay its creditors. Hejun Vanguard Group, a consulting company representing Proview creditors, said in a statement late on Wednesday that the iPad trademark in China belonged to them. Proview's main creditors are Bank of China Ltd, China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd, China Development Bank, China Guangfa Bank, Bank of Communications Co Ltd, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co Ltd, Hua Xia Bank Co Ltd and Shenzhen Pingan Bank.

A fourth year of interest rates at 0.50 percent looks highly probable and a fifth is far from impossible given the still difficult domestic and international conditions that the economy face. \"Our current view is that interest rates will not rise before late-2013 and the Bank of England could very well delay acting until 2014 given likely extended muted economic activity and the need to offset tight fiscal policy. \"While it is a stone dead certainty that interest rates are going nowhere for some considerable time to come, the outlook for quantitative easing is far less clear - although it is odds-on that the Bank of England will now sit tight until at least May. \"While we expect a final 25 billion pound dosage of QE to be enacted later this year (most probably in May) in response to likely ongoing fragile economic activity, it is very possible that the Bank of England could be done on the QE front barring a renewed serious downturn in economic activity.\" IAN MCCAFFERTY, CBI CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER: \"This decision was expected as the current round of asset purchases is set to run until May. \"Since the MPC has been signaling that the current policy stance is broadly appropriate, it appears that the economic climate would have to deteriorate to prompt a further extension of QE. \"Nevertheless, with economic conditions fragile and the level of uncertainty high, monetary policy decisions are still likely to be finely-balanced.\" (Reporting by UK Economics Desk)\n",

      " (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Philip Falcone started 2012 with a series of setbacks, but there is one thing he can still count on this year: membership in the hyper-exclusive club of the world's richest people. \n",
      " The 49-year-old investor clocked in at No. 1,075 on Forbes' 2012 list of the world's billionaires with a net worth of $1.1 billion, the magazine reported this week. For Falcone, who is betting his career on bringing wireless service to rural America, that should be reason to celebrate. He still made the list even though he has fallen hard in the rankings from last year's Number 540 spot when he had $2.2 billion to his name. A spokesman for the New York-based manager did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month U.S. regulators dealt a severe blow to LightSquared Inc, the startup telecommunications company Falcone's Harbinger Capital Partners is bankrolling, when it said the proposed satellite system should not be allowed to operate because it interferes with GPS technology used by the military and commercial airliners. Since then LightSquared has had to lay off nearly half of its staff and find other ways to conserve cash. Tough financial conditions forced Falcone to lock up his investors' money after the fund lost 47 percent last year, making some already irritated investors even angrier at him, several investors who did not want to be named publicly have said. A few weeks ago, a client filed a lawsuit charging Falcone with making \"deceptive and misleading statements\" while raising money for the Harbinger fund. Despite his troubles, the former Harvard hockey star who made $1.7 billion by betting against overheated mortgages is still part of the exclusive circle that counts some of his industry's most vaunted players. Hedge fund superstars George Soros, Carl Icahn, John Paulson, Ray Dalio, Steven Cohen and David Tepper all rank above him on the Forbes list. And some newcomers are fast nipping at Falcone's heels for a spot on the list. Chase Coleman, a 30-something investor who got his start with industry titan Julian Robertson and now runs his own Tiger Global Management, made the Forbes list for the first time this year with a net worth of $1 billion.

      " (Reuters) - Apple Inc will continue to retain the lion's share of the tablet market as its new 4G-enabled iPad readies for competition from Windows 8-based products, and a cheaper iPad 2 takes on Amazon's popular Kindle Fire, analysts said. \n",
      " Shares of Apple inched up a percent to as much as $535.89 in morning trade on Thursday, after the company unveiled an upgraded version of its popular iPad tablet, featuring a more powerful chip, high-definition screen, sharper camera and access to new high-speed wireless networks. \"Apple's ability to increase the screen resolution, graphics capabilities, and integrate 4G LTE without compromising battery life on the new iPad will be a key differentiator versus the competition and a tough act to follow,\" J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note. Last month, Microsoft released an incomplete version of Windows 8. It is the first Microsoft operating system compatible with low-power microprocessors designed by ARM Holdings Plc and will run on tablets as well as desktops and laptops, in an effort to counter the runaway success of iPad. But Apple's latest iPad will allow the company to sustain its competitive advantage and drive a dominant position in the fast-growing tablet market, said analysts. According to Credit Suisse, Apple will command 66 percent share of the tablet market in 2012, thanks to its brand, hardware offering and superior ecosystem. The global tablet user base already reached 67 million in 2011, according to researcher Strategy Analytics. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook introduced the highly anticipated third iteration of the tablet, but broke away from the tradition of calling the third-generation tablet the iPad 3, as some had expected, referring to it simply as the \"new iPad.\" Still, analysts say the company \"is just getting started,\" and that it will have more to offer, including a full-fledged TV offering and a thinner iPhone 5 that may be capable of operating on the \"LTE,\" or Long-Term Evolution, network. At speeds roughly 10 times faster than current 3G technology, that may help banish the sometimes shaky video quality of older devices. \"We expect the company to have several other strong new product cycles over the next 1-2 years, including the iPhone 5 (LTE-enabled) and the iTV,\" said FBN Securities' analyst Shebly Seyrafi said. FBN raised its price target to $730 from $650. CHEAPER IPAD 2 The company said it will continue to sell the iPad 2 but dropped its price by $100. The older tablet now starts at $399 while the new third-generation wi-fi only iPad starts at $499. Morgan Stanley analysts said the cheaper iPad 2 will have a minimal impact on gross margins, and expect the drop in price of the device to drive incremental demand of 15 million to 20 million in the United States and 38 million worldwide. Following the cut in the price of iPad 2, Apple is now well positioned to counter competition from products at the lower end of the market like Amazon.com Inc's Kindle Fire given the device's superior hardware features, say analysts. \"We believe the new iPad and the lower price point for the iPad 2 will enable Apple to continue its momentum and tablet market dominance, and we continue to expect rapid installed base growth in 2012 and beyond,\" Goldman Sachs analysts, including Bill Shope, wrote in a note to clients. Analysts at Goldman raised their price target on Apple stock to $660 from $600. ThinkEquity analysts lifted their share-price target by $50 to $600. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, 25 analysts rate Apple at \"strong buy,\" another 25 at \"buy,\" while three have a \"hold\" rating. Two analysts rate the stock at \"sell\" or its equivalent rating. The 55 analysts covering Apple have a mean price target of $575.23 on the stock, which closed at $530.69 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq. Apple shares were up $3 to $533.69 in early trade. They have fallen 3 percent since touching a year-high on March 1, a day after the company's market value topped the $500 billion mark.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury Department said on Wednesday it will sell $6 billion worth of American International Group stock and struck another deal for the insurer to pay down $8.5 billion more in obligations, taking a major step forward in an election year to unwind the unpopular crisis-era bailout. \n",
      " AIG said the agreement with the government would allow it to pay down what it owed in a special purpose vehicle, AIA Aurora, and free up the company's collateral against that, including interests in aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp and Asian insurer AIA Group Ltd. The special purpose vehicle was set up in December 2009 in exchange for a reduction in the debt that AIG owed the New York Federal Reserve at the time. The Treasury's original interest in the vehicle was $16 billion. The stake sale is expected reduce the U.S. government's ownership in AIG to about 70 percent from 77 percent, a source with knowledge of the situation said. Once the company repays Treasury for the special vehicle interest, the value of the government's stake would total about $41.8 billion. The announcements come as President Barack Obama, a Democrat, fights to win a second term in office and withstands attacks from Republicans for wasting taxpayer money. \"The bottom line is this: the people of AIG have achieved another significant milestone in our progress toward our goal that American taxpayers recoup their entire investment in AIG at a profit,\" AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said in a statement. Earlier this week, AIG sold part of its stake in AIA to raise about $6 billion to repay the government. Following the share sale, AIG holds about 19 percent of AIA. STOCK PRICE RUN-UP AIG had to be rescued during the financial crisis of 2008 through multiple bailouts, under both the Obama and Bush administrations, with the U.S. government at one point pledging some $182 billion to keep the insurer afloat. In the last few years, Benmosche has been trying to steady the ship and selling off non-core assets to pay back the government. Last month the company reported a net profit of nearly $20 billion for the fourth quarter. While the outsized profit was a one-time event linked to a tax accounting change, underlying it was a long-term assumption that the company has stopped its multibillion dollar crisis-era losses. The share sale plan comes as AIG's stock price has run up some 27 percent this year, possibly giving the government an opportunity to offload some of its stake without having to take a loss. For the government to break-even on its investment in AIG, it needs to sell shares at about $29. The stock closed up 1.4 percent on Wednesday at $29.45, although it fell about 1.9 percent in aftermarket trading following the announcements. The source said the shares have not been priced yet. Treasury declined to comment on the pricing. PLAN DETAILS Under the latest plan, AIG intends to repurchase up to $3 billion of its stock in the Treasury's offering once it is priced. The Treasury will also grant an option to the underwriters for the offering to purchase an additional $900 million worth of stock. The U.S. government hired Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley to coordinate the offering, choosing a different set of bankers than AIG had when it first sold stock early last year. The choice is a reversal in fortunes for the two U.S. investment banks. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley had played key roles in the insurer's restructuring but were left out of the coveted lead bookrunner roles in the offering last year. AIG is expected to repay the $8.5 billion owed under the AIA vehicle with proceeds from several sources, the Treasury said. The company expects to pay $5.6 billion from the sale of the AIA stake. It expects to get $1.6 billion in escrowed cash proceeds from an earlier sale of its life insurance unit, American Life Insurance Co, to MetLife Inc. AIG also expects to get $1.6 billion as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sells off the last of the securities held in Maiden Lane II LLC, a vehicle that was created to buy mortgage backed securities from AIG during the financial crisis as part of its bailout.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Families took on more debt in late 2011 for the first time in 3-1/2 years but a rise in after-tax incomes left consumers in better shape to spend. \n",
      " Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits rose last week, but not enough to change perceptions the labor market was strengthening. The economy is still limping back from a financial crisis that wreaked havoc on household finances and put millions of people out of work. However, rising incomes eased the pinch in the fourth quarter. The ratio of household liabilities to after-tax income - a broad measure of the debt burden - fell to 117.5 percent, its lowest level since 2004. Economists are unsure how much more that debt burden must decline for consumers to feel normal again, but Thursday's data pointed to progress. \"Any little inroads we make bring us that much closer to getting back to a normal rate of consumer spending,\" said Ellen Zentner, an economist at Nomura in New York. In a separate report, Labor Department data showed initial claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week to 362,000. Still, new claims remained near the four-year low reached last month. \"You are bound to get some uptick even when the overall trend is downward. The labor market is improving, but it's still quite impaired,\" said Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. A closely watched report on employment on Friday is expected to show solid job growth in February and could reduce chances of more monetary stimulus from the Fed, which meets on Tuesday. The government is expected to report the economy added 210,000 new jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey. THE WEALTH EFFECT U.S. financial markets largely ignored Thursday's data, with traders taking their cue from developments on Greece's efforts to get private creditors to join a bond-swap deal. With labor market conditions improving, Americans appear more willing and more able to take on debt. Consumer credit swelled by 6.9 percent during last three months of 2011, the Fed said. It was the biggest gain since the same period in 2001 when credit was surging in the wake of the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington. Other reports have shown that much of the recent surge in borrowing has been to buy cars and pay for college. In the fourth quarter, the Fed's report showed households continued to shed mortgage debt, which declined at a 1.5 percent annual rate. That was the smallest drop in two years, suggesting Americans were closer to recovering from the debt hangover left by a burst housing bubble. It also showed household wealth increased by $1.2 trillion, with a drop in the value of real estate tempering gains from stocks. The extra wealth could lead consumers to spend more, especially if home prices bottom out, as some analysts expect. \"The combined wealth effects from financial and housing assets (will likely) begin lending increasing support to consumption growth as the year progresses,\" Troy Davig, an economist at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients. Still, families have struggled to rebuild their net wealth after the country's housing bubble popped and triggered the last recession. Household net wealth in the fourth quarter was still about 13 percent below its peak in the second quarter of 2007. (Editing by  Neil Stempleman )\n"

      " BEIJING/SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Beijing and the influential U.S. agriculture department may have overstated China's corn crop by as much as 14 percent, pointing to higher imports from the world's second-largest consumer of the grain that could squeeze already tightening global supplies. \n",
      " If China plugs the gap between projected and actual domestic supply with additional corn imports, it would drive up international prices already near four-month highs. Wheat markets could feel the impact too if Beijing snaps up the grain as a substitute to corn for animal feed. \"Many are skeptical over the corn output figure,\" said Li Qiang, a senior analyst with JC Intelligence (JCI), an influential consultancy. \"The industry expected an output increase, but not by as much as the bureau says.\" China's National Bureau of Statistics said that farms produced a record corn crop in 2011 of 191.8 million tonnes. But enthusiastic local officials often overstate the size of crops in China to impress central authorities and win bigger subsidies. A Reuters investigation based on assessments from some cooperatives, key trading houses and JCI suggests that Beijing has overstated the crop size by between 6.8 million tonnes and 24 million tonnes, the equivalent of between 12 days and 44 days of consumption. The impact of tighter-than-expected supplies is already being felt in the domestic market. Competition between local industry processors and state-owned procurement agencies for supplies is pushing domestic prices higher. State grain buyers are struggling to replenish depleted national stocks, raising the risk the government will limit purchases by processors, whose rapid expansion has been blamed by Beijing for threatening the country's grains supply. Strategic stocks are well below the government's comfort level after three years in which Beijing has drawn them down to boost domestic supply and dampen food prices driven higher by growing demand for meat from an increasingly affluent population. Low stockpiles give Beijing little wriggle room before it has to import. The United States Department of Agriculture, whose figures international traders rely on to gauge global demand and supply, estimates the record crop plus imports of four million tonnes will meet China's demand this year. But it may need much more to plug the supply shortfall caused by the crop overestimate, bolstering a global corn market already being hampered by a severe drought in agriculture powerhouses Brazil and Argentina. Just two weeks ago, China bought 120,000 tonnes, it's first purchase since the harvest was completed late last year. Chicago Board of Trade benchmark corn prices hit their highest levels since January this week as drought in agricultural powerhouses Brazil and Argentina worried buyers, although the price is well off the highs of 2010 and 2011. U.S. corn stocks are forecast by the U.S. agriculture department to shrink this year to their smallest level in 16 years, reducing U.S. export potential to meet China's needs. Still, global wheat supplies are in a better position to take up some of the slack. Major producer Australia is expecting record-high wheat output this year, adding to bumper supplies from the Black Sea region. World wheat stocks at the end of the 2011/12 season look set to eclipse the previous record set more than a decade ago, according to the International Grains Council (IGC), which raised its forecast for production to an all-time high. That will encourage China to buy more wheat and only take corn when prices dip or look relatively cheap. \"They are smart buyers so they will be very opportunistic, choosing the right time to buy,\" said Adam Davis, a senior commodity analyst at Merricks Capital in Melbourne. \"We see year-on-year increase in corn imports, just as we did with soybean imports.\" <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ China corn yields, acreage:  link.reuters.com/tet76s Corn versus soy imports:  link.reuters.com/xet76s China pork production:  link.reuters.com/set76s Top corn importers, exporters:  r.reuters.com/cav42s China-Argentina pact to heat up competition for U.S. corn: Daily grain market wrap: <GRA/> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> HOW MUCH LESS? The government's subsidy policy has led farmers to increase acreage dedicated to corn and grow less soybeans, so a rise in output could be expected. But JCI estimates China's corn crop at 168 million tonnes, close to 24 million tonnes lower than the official data. JCI was the first to challenge the high official corn crop estimates in 2009, and the consultancy's skepticism was borne out by China's 2010 imports. Official think-tank China National Grain and Oils Information Centre puts the harvest at 185 million tonnes, more than 6 million tonnes below the official estimate. Some traders from state-owned grains trading houses pegged output at about 180 million tonnes. China's officials say it has enough corn reserves and will not need to import large quantities this year. But traders are skeptical, arguing the officials are trying to talk prices down ahead of a shopping spree. The growing realization that domestic corn supplies are tighter than previously thought is driving prices higher. Farmers have held on to their grain in expectation prices will rise more. Physical corn prices at Dalian, China's largest grains port, have risen to 2,400 yuan a tonne, the highest since October and edging towards the record of 2,480 a tonne reached before the harvest started in October. \"Corn processors have been raising their purchase prices because farmers are not selling,\" said Zheng Guichen, deputy general manager with Dacheng Group, the country's top corn processor based in Jilin province in the northeast corn belt. \"We believe farmers are holding more than half of their harvest here in Jilin as they are in no rush to sell.\" GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION? China does not publish its inventory figures. But traders estimate that it has 10 million tonnes of stocks, which is less than a month of consumption and far less than the three months of consumption Beijing considers ideal. Sinograin, which manages the state grains reserves, has offered to buy grain at about 10 percent to 20 percent below market to replenish stocks. Official data shows the government has sold about 55 million tonnes of reserves since 2009 to damp down local prices. With farmers holding out for higher prices, sources said Sinograin has fallen well short of its plan to buy 10-12 million tonnes of corn by the end of January. They estimate it has not managed to secure any significant volume since the stockpiling campaign started in mid-December. The risk for industrial processors is that the government will step in, like it did in 2011, and order them to stop buying to make way for state reserve purchases. Aware of its longer-term import needs, China is increasing its supply sources, having relied on U.S. corn imports so far. It signed a trade pact earlier this month with Argentina, the world's second-largest exporter, and suppliers in the Black Sea grain belt are looking at sales to China for the first time. \"China is a tough market, we have not sold anything to it as yet, but there may be opportunity in the future,\" said Andrew Druzyaka, an official of the State Food and Grain Corp of Ukraine, at a conference in Singapore last month. APPETITE China is widely expected to dominate the global corn trade in the years ahead after becoming a net importer just three years ago. Many analysts see the rise in corn imports mirroring the quick rise in soy imports that have made China the top soy importer. Imports of 3.77 million tonnes of corn in 2011 were the highest since 1993-1994. China will quadruple its purchases of corn, the U.S. agriculture department said in a 10-year outlook. China's grain output is failing to keep pace with demand because of the rapid expansion of its livestock industry, which is quickly turning from backyard farms to an organized industry of large modern complexes that require more corn to ensure steady supplies. To keep pace, the country's largest corn consumer, New Hope Group, says Beijing should free up imports of grain for animals and redefine the country's grain security policy by only placing restrictions on imports for human consumption.

      " Cano said it would ask the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division to approve a marketing process in which NBI Services Inc would be appointed as a \"stalking horse\" bidder. A \"stalking horse\" is a bidder chosen by a bankrupt company from a pool of potential suitors to make the first bid for its assets, which is used as the base for a sales process. In the absence of a higher bid, NBI would pay $47.5 million for the reorganized Cano and the amount would then be distributed to creditors, the company said. The company said it would continue to manage its properties and operate its businesses while it seeks confirmation of its joint plan of reorganization.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The new iPad's faster data speeds will likely impress consumers, right up until they get a nasty surprise in the form of increased wireless service fees. \n",
      " To counter the shock, analysts say AT&T Inc and Verizon Wireless need to get creative with their data pricing. Apple Inc's U.S. iPad partners AT&T and Verizon Wireless base their mobile Web access fees on customer usage, unlike Sprint Nextel, which does not sell the iPad but still offers unlimited data use for a flat fee. Buyers of the new iPad who use it a lot on the go may end up paying more than the typical monthly fees, which start at $15 at AT&T and $20 at Verizon Wireless. Some may opt for a Wi-Fi only iPad in order to avoid service provider fees entirely. But if operators adjust their data plans, they could avoid upsetting existing subscribers and maybe even attract new ones who might have been leaning toward Wi-Fi only, according to analysts. \"In our view, current tablet data plans offered by AT&T and Verizon seem ill-matched for the new LTE iPad, which has the potential to consume a lot of data,\" Guggenheim Partners analyst Sing Yin said in a research note. \"However, a multi-device data plan could make the LTE option more attractive.\" Telecom executives have realized for some time that their pricing models for tablets are unattractive. A vast majority of consumers have voted with their wallets by opting for Wi-Fi only versions of previous iPad models over the tablets with connections to the carriers' networks. As early as May 2011, Verizon Wireless told Reuters it was looking at data service plan changes. Verizon Communications Inc Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo told an investor conference last month that his company would come out with some form of account-based billing by the middle of this year: People in family plans or corporate accounts would be able to share a single bucket of minutes. This would not eliminate usage-based billing but would give customers with multiple devices more flexibility. \"You have enterprise customers. You have family (customers) who have a number of devices in their portfolio where they would just want to pay a price and share the data instead of buying an individual data plan for each phone,\" Shammo said. Such changes could go a long way toward encouraging use of the iPad on the cellular network, UBS analyst John Hodulik said in an interview ahead of Wednesday's launch of the new iPad. \"That will promote people to buy more devices that are connected to the cellular network,\" Hodulik said. \"People are very focused on how much data they use.\" Verizon Wireless is a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America NA prevented homeowners from receiving mortgage-loan modifications under a federal program in order to avoid millions of dollars in losses while benefitting from financial incentives for participating in the program, according to a complaint unsealed in federal court Wednesday. \n",
      " The suit is the second whistleblower complaint unsealed so far with apparent ties to the $1 billion False Claims Act settlement announced by Bank of America and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York on February 9. The Bank of America settlement is also part of the sweeping $25 billion agreement reached between state and federal authorities. Final settlement documents have yet to be filed in the BoA settlement, which the U.S. Attorney's Office said was the largest ever False Claims Act payout related to mortgage fraud. The settlement resolved claims that Bank of America's Countywide Financial subsidiaries defrauded the Federal Housing Administration by inflating appraisals used for government-insured home loans, as well as claims involving the Home Affordable Modification Program, a federal program to help American homeowners facing foreclosure. The complaint unsealed Wednesday was filed by whistleblower Gregory Mackler, a Colorado resident who said he worked alongside Bank of America executives while an employee at Urban Lending Solutions, a company to which Bank of America contracted some of its HAMP work. While working at Urban Lending, Mackler said he saw BofA and its loan servicing subsidiary, BAC Homes Loans Servicing LP, implement \"business practices designed to intentionally prevent scores of eligible homeowners from becoming eligible or staying eligible for permanent HAMP modification.\" The bank and its agents routinely pretended to have lost homeowners' documents, failed to credit payments during trial modifications and intentionally misled homeowners about their eligibility for the program, the complaint alleged. BoA let through just enough HAMP modifications to avert suspicion and allay congressional critics, while not enough to incur any substantial losses to its own bottom line, according to the complaint. \"In other words, BoA has had it both ways. BoA has continued to maximize the value of its mortgage portfolio with anti-HAMP modification practices and managed to make money by committing fraud on homeowner,\" the lawsuit said. A lawyer for Mackler could neither confirm nor deny that the complaint was tied to the settlement. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office and a representative for Bank of America declined to comment. In February, a whistleblower complaint was unsealed from Kyle Lagow, a former employee in a Countrywide appraisal unit which detailed allegations of Countrywide's \"corrupt underwriting and appraisal process.\" Bank of America purchased Countywide in June 2008. Under the False Claims Act, successful whistleblower complaints can earn that whistleblower up to 25 percent of the settlement amount. According to the docket, the U.S. Department of Justice has until March 16 to decide whether to intervene in both the Mackler and Lagow case. The case is United States of America v. Bank of America NA et al., in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, no. 11-3270. (Reporting by Jessica Dye)\n",

Still, February's job cuts were up 2 percent from the same time a year ago when 50,702 cuts were announced. For the first two months of 2012 there have been 105,214 layoffs, about an 18-percent jump from 89,221 at the start of last year. Transportation and consumer product companies announced the most cuts last month with 14,065 and 13,856 layoffs, respectively. \"Both sectors are undoubtedly feeling the impact of rising fuel prices as heavy users of fuel, but also from their dependency on consumers, who are being forced to spend more on gasoline and less on the products and services provided by these firms,\" John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. However, far fewer jobs have been cut in the government sector this year, with layoffs sliding to 3,654 for January and February from 22,830 the same time last year. Meanwhile, planned hiring announcements jumped 42 percent to 10,720 in February from 7,568 in January. But that level dropped off 85.2 percent from 72,581 in February 2011.

      " PARIS  (Reuters) - Franco-Dutch airline Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) warned that a soaring fuel bill would hit profits this year after it swung to a loss in 2011 and scrapped its dividend. \n",
      " With fuel costs expected to increase by 1.1 billion euros ($1.44 billion) in 2012, Air France-KLM said operating profit in the first half of the year would be below that of the year-earlier period. \"The economic outlook remains uncertain while the fuel price remains at a record level in euros,\" the company said on Thursday. But results in the second half of 2012 should benefit from the first effects of its three-year turnaround plan, it added, without giving a specific forecast. Air France-KLM pledged in January to cut debt by 2 billion euros by the end of 2014 and said it would shrink its fleet by shedding more than a billion euros from a planned expansion project. Air France-KLM's European rivals are also feeling the pinch from higher fuel costs and the effects of the euro zone debt crisis on passenger and cargo demand. British Airways owner IAG ( ICAG.L ) said last week underperforming Spanish unit Iberia and high fuel costs would dent earnings this year, though it reported a forecast-beating rise in 2011 profit. Irish airline Aer Lingus ( AERL.I ) warned profit would fall this year due to higher fuel costs, while Finnish national carrier Finnair ( FIA1S.HE ) last month reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss due to higher fuel costs and a weaker economy. German rival Deutsche Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) posted a surprise full-year loss on Wednesday, though it attributed this to a larger-than-expected charge on the sale of its British Midland unit to IAG. As part of its transformation plan, Air France-KLM, in which the French government holds 15.84 percent, has scaled down plans to grow capacity by 2014 in an effort to improve the demand per available seat, a method of pushing up average revenue. TOUGH YEAR It is also deferring deliveries of several Airbus ( EAD.PA ) and Boeing ( BA.N ) aircraft. Air France-KLM posted an operating loss of 353 million euros for 2011, compared with a profit of 28 million euros in the previous year, reflecting a 904 million euro hike in its fuel bill, the airline said. No dividend will be paid for 2011, it said. \"2011 was a tough year for the group, due to the uncertain operating environment and the high fuel price,\" Chief Executive Jean-Cyril Spinetta said in a statement. Oddo analysts said the loss was in line with its forecasts. Shares in Air France-KLM, which have lost around 65 percent of their value in the last 12 months, were trading 2 percent higher at 4.27 euros at 1123 GMT, in line with the SBF120 index  .SBF120 , up 2.1 percent. Spinetta was recalled as chief executive in addition to his chairman role last November, following months of underperformance at the airline compared with rivals. Spinetta said all the restructuring plan's measures were underway, including a wage freeze for 2012 and 2013.

      " HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Tough operating conditions and heightened refinancing risks in China's property market are pushing more developers closer to their downgrade thresholds, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said in a report on Thursday. \n",
      " In the report titled \"The Worst Is Yet To Come For Chinese Developers In Asia's Shaky Property Sector,\" S&P warned that more credit downgrades are likely in the next six months. \"Many developers in China may be at increased risk of refinancing due to weaker property sales, high funding costs, and tightened liquidity. And that will increase the pressure on ratings,\" S&P credit analyst Bei Fu said in a news release. The company in the past month downgraded Yanlord Land Group, Coastal Greenland, Yuzhou Properties and Zhong An Real Estate. The rating agency says small developers that are highly concentrated in certain cities and projects are vulnerable to policy risk while bigger, diversified developers stand to benefit. \"Some small and mid-sized companies may find it increasingly hard to maintain their competitive positions when lenders and investors turn cautious on higher-risk credits,\" the agency stated. \"But large and well-capitalized developers will continue to grow by acquiring land at now deflated land prices and accessing funding.\" Standard & Poor's predicts that China's home prices could drop 10 percent between June 2011 and June 2012. Sales volume is likely to be flat at best or slip this year, the agency said. That poses a problem for cash-strapped developers that have found their access to bank loans curtailed. Many have turned to expensive short-term credit such as trust loans. S&P said refinancing risks for developers are rising thanks to higher bank borrowing costs and high yields in the bond market. Although sales for larger developers are generally strong in February, analysts say they have yet to see clear signs of improvement in the industry [ID:nL4E8E80PR]. Home prices in China fell in February for the sixth straight month, according to a private survey, as two years of government measures to curb property speculation hit home [nL4E8E13JJ].

      " (Reuters) - The Justice Department has warned Apple and five major U.S. publishers that it plans to sue them, accusing them of colluding to raise the prices of electronic books, a person familiar with the probe said on Thursday. \n",
      " Several parties have held talks to settle the potential antitrust case, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The five publishers facing possible Justice Department action are Simon & Schuster Inc, a unit of CBS Corp; Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group; Pearson Plc's Penguin Group (USA); Macmillan, a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH; and HarperCollins Publishers Inc, a unit of News Corp. U.S. and European officials have been investigating whether e-book publishers and Apple fixed prices in the growing electronic book industry, blocking rivals and hurting consumers. Publishers adopted an \"agency model\" in 2010, around the time that Apple launched the iPad, allowing publishers to set the price of e-books. In turn, Apple would take a 30 percent cut. The Wall Street Journal first reported the Justice Department's lawsuit warning to Apple and the publishers. The European Commission said in December that it was looking at the same five publishers for potential violations of antitrust law in how e-books were priced. The escalation in the antitrust probe comes as publishers battle Amazon, which had previously set its own, discounted prices for electronic books in order to sell its Kindle electronic reader. In a parallel class action lawsuit now in a Manhattan court, Apple is accused of working with publishers just before its iPad was launched in 2010. The suit brought on behalf of e-book customers, alleges Apple and the publishers colluded to shift e-book pricing from a wholesale method, where retailers pay for the product and charge what they like, to agency pricing, where publishers would tell retailers what they can charge. The class action lawsuit, filed by law firm Hagens, Berman, Sobol, Shapiro, LLP, accuses Apple of being a \"hub\" for collusion. Apple's push for agency pricing was detailed in Walter Isaacson's biography of Apple founder Steve Jobs. The book says that Jobs, who died in October, was aware of publishers' frustration with Amazon. It quotes Jobs as saying: \"So we told the publishers, 'We'll go to the agency model, where you set the price, and we get our 30 percent and yes, the customer pays a little more but that's what you want anyway.' ... So they went to Amazon and said, 'You're going to sign an agency contract or we're not going to give you the books.'\" An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a Justice Department spokeswoman. HarperCollins could not immediately be reached for a comment. Penguin, Hachette and Simon & Schuster declined to comment.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A group of investors is suing to block a proposed initial public offering by the owner of the 102-storey Empire State Building in at least the second lawsuit of its kind, on grounds that it unfairly undervalues their interests. \n",
      " The Malkin family, which controls the company that owns the skyscraper, is trying to engineer a \"self-interested and one-sided\" transaction that leaves smaller investors in the dark about whether the possible $1 billion IPO is fair, according to a complaint filed on Wednesday with the New York state court in Manhattan. The putative class-action lawsuit follows a similar investor lawsuit filed March 1. Plaintiffs include investors in companies whose equity could be converted into stock of the Malkins' proposed new company, Empire State Realty Trust. That company would be a real estate investment trust whose holdings would include 12 office buildings, six retail properties and land in New York and Connecticut. Last month, the Malkins filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the IPO, which would consolidate several privately held companies. The shares would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"ESB\". But the plaintiffs said the offering awards too much of the value of the underlying properties to the Malkins, and improperly gives the Malkins effective voting control. Empire State Realty would have two classes of stock, with the Malkins primarily getting Class B shares that carry 50 votes per share. \"The Malkin defendants availed themselves of every opportunity to benefit from the proposed transaction at the direct expense\" of the smaller investors,\" the complaint said. In the proposed transaction, the Malkins have also allocated themselves more than $328 million in \"excess\" management fees, according to the lawsuit. SKYSCRAPER OWNER: SUIT IS \"BASELESS\" The IPO documents are subject to SEC review. \"This is a baseless lawsuit, and it goes without saying that we will vigorously oppose it,\" said a spokesman for the Malkins. Other defendants include the estate of Leona Helmsley, whose late husband Harry helped form the company now overseen by the Malkins that operates the 81-year-old Empire State Building. Following the IPO, Anthony Malkin would become chairman, chief executive and president of Empire State Realty. Malkin's family has controlled and managed the Empire State Building since 1961 and the land beneath it since 2002. The building alone was recently appraised at $2.52 billion. Among its tenants are the fragrance company Coty Inc, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and career networking website operator LinkedIn Corp ( LNKD.N ). In the nine months ended September 30, the proposed Empire State Realty Trust generated $71 million of profit on revenue of $382.2 million, with more than 40 percent of revenue coming from the Empire State Building. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are listed as lead underwriters for the proposed IPO. The case is Laurence Reinlieb v.

      " Earlier in the week, the S&P 500 posted its first big loss for the year on fears of a disorderly default in Greece. Now it is down just 0.3 percent for the week, and Thursday's advance was led by shares in the materials and industrial sectors. Greece was able to convince enough private bondholders to accept a restructuring on Thursday, moving it closer to unlocking aid needed to avoid a disruptive default. \"Today's move is based on the assumption that the Greek deal is resolved. But this is an important week, as we still have the jobs report due tomorrow,\" said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Expectation for Friday's U.S. jobs data are for a net gain of 210,000 jobs in February. An unexpected rise in new U.S. weekly jobless claims on Thursday was not enough to change perceptions that the labor market was strengthening - a major catalyst in the current rally. \"As long as it comes in line with forecast, or even a little bit lower, it will strengthen the current upward trend,\" DeGan said. Apple shares ( AAPL.O ) jumped 2.1 percent to $541.99. Analysts said Apple will continue to retain the lion's share of the tablet market as its new 4G-enabled iPad readies for competition from Windows 8-based products, and a cheaper iPad 2 takes on Amazon's popular Kindle Fire. An S&P index of basic materials stocks .GSPM shot up 1.6 percent, leading the S&P 500's advance. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodities index .CRB rose 0.6 percent, shifting into positive mode after four straight down sessions. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 70.61 points, or 0.55 percent, to 12,907.94 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 13.28 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,365.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  advanced 34.73 points, or 1.18 percent, to close at 2,970.42. Coach Inc ( COH.N ), the luxury leather goods retailer, hit a record high of $78.22 after the overall positive tone of a presentation at a Bank of America conference. The stock later eased, but it still ended up 4.6 percent at $76.79. American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) fell 3.9 percent to $28.31 after the U.S. Treasury priced its $6 billion offering of AIG stock at $29 a share. That would allow the Obama administration to break even on its investment in the insurer as it winds down bailout programs from the financial crisis. The S&P financial sector .GSPF gained 1 percent while the KBW insurance index .KIX climbed 0.7 percent. The Dow was pressured by McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ). The stock fell 3.2 percent to $96.96 after the world's largest hamburger chain reported a smaller-than-expected rise in February sales. Hovnanian Enterprises ( HOV.N ) shares jumped 13.4 percent to $2.79, pushing the PHLX housing sector index .HGX up 3 percent. Volume was light, with about 6.1 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, below the daily average of 6.9 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, about 18 stocks rose for nearly every seven that fell.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England left its monetary policy unchanged on Thursday, deciding that February's extra 50 billion pounds ($79 billion) of quantitative easing was enough for now to support the economy through a period of fitful recovery. \n",
      " None of the economists polled by Reuters last week had expected the BoE to deviate from the latest three-month program of gilt purchases with new money, announced last month, and the debate is increasingly shifting to whether there will be more QE in May. February's meeting showed growing divisions on the Monetary Policy Committee, despite the majority vote to raise the QE total by 50 billion pounds to 325 billion. Two MPC members wanted a 75 billion pound increase, while others saw a case for no QE at all. There was little market reaction to Thursday's decision, and most economists now doubt that there will be further QE in May unless there is a sharp worsening in the euro zone debt crisis. \"We expect the BoE to refrain from further asset purchases and to shift into a wait-and-see mode ... based on our view that the economic recovery should have gained some traction by May,\" said ABN Amro economist Joost Beaumont. How the MPC's debate panned out this month will become clear on March 21, when the BoE releases minutes of their two-day meeting. Finance minister George Osborne will present his 2012 budget, in which he is under pressure to find ways to boost sluggish growth, the same day. However, Britain's coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats cannot engage in any significant spending measures due to a commitment to largely eliminate the country's hefty budget deficit before a national election in May 2015. Part of Osborne's plans involve 'credit easing' measures to boost the flow of lending to smaller firms. BoE Governor Mervyn King has strongly resisted expanding the central bank's remit beyond buying gilts and a token sum of corporate bonds, saying it is the job of government and commercial banks to make more fine-grained decisions about which sectors firms should get scarce credit. The BoE has forecast a choppy recovery this year, with growth likely to be distorted by an extra public holiday to mark Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee as well as an influx of tourists for the London Olympics. Business activity surveys have softened slightly from January's relatively strong readings, and oil prices have surged - a double-edged sword that may push up inflation in the short-term, but weaken medium-term growth. With inflation still well above target at 3.6 percent, the record high just hit by British petrol prices may make more hawkish policymakers nervous about the central bank's forecast that inflation will be below 2 percent by the end of the year. March's policy decision marks the third anniversary of the BoE's decision at the depths of the financial crisis in 2009 to cut interest rates to a record-low 0.5 percent and start buying financial market assets with newly created money. QE has generally enjoyed support from Britain's politicians and public, though there have been concerns that it has hurt pensioners' retirement income. Earlier on Thursday, the National Association of Pension Funds said the 125 billion pounds of QE sanctioned since October may have cost them 90 billion pounds.

      " SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - General Motors Co chief executive Dan Akerson said it may be two years before its European division is back in profit as the continent sheds over-capacity the same way the U.S. industry had to over the past half decade. \n",
      " The world's largest automaker has lost money in Europe for the last 12 years. \"I think it'll be a good year or two before we can achieve profitability in Europe again,\" Akerson said at an on-stage interview conducted in San Francisco on Wednesday night. European sales had been recovering before the continent became gripped by fears of debt defaults in the middle of last year, Akerson said at the Commonwealth Club of California, a non-profit public affairs forum. \"People stopped buying. I can see it every day in the sales reports,\" said Akerson, who was born in California and studied at the London School of Economics. Industry-wide, Akerson believed there were between seven and 10 excess car plants in Europe and other executives estimate there is 20 percent over-capacity there. He emphasized that a deal with France's PSA Peugeot Citroen announced last week was merely an alliance and that each carmaker had its own problems to solve. GM announced last week that it would halt production of the Chevy Volt plug-in electric car for five weeks and temporarily lay off 1,300 U.S. workers. But Akerson, arguing that a two-week production shutdown last year for its popular Cruze compact car did not generate as much concern, dismissed the worries surrounding the Volt as political. \"Sometimes I feel bad for President Obama,\" Akerson told reporters, saying the Volt was in the works long before Obama's election, yet it was seen as his car due to the government's 27 percent stake in GM after its bailout. \"It's not the Obama car.\" Akerson had said earlier that, while it was not up to him, his ideal outcome would be for the government to, for example, sell off the stake steadily over 10 quarters because he believed uncertainty about it was weighing on GM's share price. Obama's re-election campaign often touts the auto sector bailout as one of the Democrat's major accomplishments as president, seeking to draw a contrast with Republican White House contender Mitt Romney, who opposed it. The Obama administration has backed more than $2 billion to support the development of battery systems designed for electric cars including the $40,000 Volt. Volt owners are also eligible for a $7,500 tax credit for buying the fuel-efficient vehicle. GM is adjusting the Volt to meet strict California requirements for a further $1,500 state rebate and allow drivers to use special carpool lanes in the state, where a fourth of the 7,671 Volts GM sold in 2011 were purchased.

      " BERLIN  (Reuters) - Athens' failure to accept Germany's help on reducing bureaucracy and boosting private investment is disappointing, German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler was cited as saying by a newspaper on Thursday. \n",
      " Germany pledged last October to advise Greece on cutting red tape and attracting investment to help its economy get back on its feet and have a fighting chance to cope with its debt. The agreement was struck during Roesler's visit to Greece as head of a 70-strong delegation of German industry representatives seeking business in the country. \"The aid has hardly been accepted, a lot has been in vain so far, it is very disillusioning,\" Roesler told the Saarbruecker Zeitung. The newspaper quoted a ministry progress report on the deal, which read: \"The implementation clearly is not a priority on the Greek side.\" Companies wanting to invest in Greece have met with hurdles such as a multitude of approval procedures and unclear responsibility, according to the ministry. \"It is not failing due to a lack of will, the fundamental problem are the structures,\" Roesler told the paper. Roesler said he was also disappointed that some German companies which had previously done business with Greece had still not been paid. \"The Greek side said during my visit that it would soon resolve the old cases,\" he said. \"Unfortunately there has been hardly any progress on this.\" Germany has a big stake in the debt-stricken Greek economy. Athens has been one of the biggest buyers of German armaments over the past decade and German companies manage some of Greece's largest firms, including Athens International Airport, managed by engineering firm Hochtief. Greece's cash-strapped hospitals owe dozens of millions of euros in arrears to German drugmakers and health equipment providers, such as Bayer. Roesler urged the Greek government to do what was necessary to ensure it could return to growth. Athens needed to create the necessary conditions for growth, by modernizing the administration, opening up its markets and implementing its privatization programme, he said. \"Only when these steps have been seriously implemented will the willingness to invest increase,\" he said. Greece, unable to borrow normally on the bond markets, urgently needs a bailout agreed last month to keep paying its bills while it attempts to make deep structural reforms to its shattered economy, now in the fifth year of deep recession. Euro zone finance ministers are due to decide whether to release the 130 billion euros ($170.57 billion) package during a conference call on Friday but they have already approved the bailout, subject to a private sector creditor agreement slated to go through later on Thursday.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc, the biggest U.S. company by market value, was told it cannot now pursue ongoing patent infringement litigation against bankrupt photography giant Eastman Kodak Co. \n",
      " U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper, who oversees Kodak's Chapter 11 case, said at a Thursday hearing it would be an \"inappropriate way forward\" to allow Apple to continue pursuing claims against Kodak while the company is in bankruptcy. The infringement claims center on a Kodak patent that lets consumers preview digital photographs on LCD screens. Judge Gropper also denied Apple's request to file a new patent infringement lawsuit against Kodak over printer and digital camera patents. A Kodak spokeswoman said the company was \"pleased\" with the judge's ruling. Apple in February had asked the court for permission to lift a stay freezing a patent lawsuit pending in a federal court in Kodak's hometown of Rochester, New York. Apple had hoped to move the case to Manhattan for a jury trial. But while Gropper denied that request, he agreed that the case needs to be resolved sooner rather than later, and in a way that does not interfere with Kodak's ongoing plans to sell its patent portfolio and emerge from bankruptcy. \"I would request that the parties report to me on their efforts to come up with a procedure that truly works,\" he said. Kodak had accused Apple of trying to slow the patent sale process, which it must undertake by the end of June under the terms of a $950 million loan keeping it afloat through bankruptcy. Apple had also sought to bring new patent infringement claims against Kodak, but Gropper nixed that effort under a federal rule designed to shield bankrupt entities from litigation that might constitute \"creditor harassment.\" Apple had argued that patent litigation has been a major part of Kodak's strategy. \"I'm sure they have no problem moving ahead with the lawsuits where they're the complainants,\" Apple lawyer David Seligman told the judge.

      " The data released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve also showed household wealth increasing by $1.2 trillion, which could also support spending. The report showed the ratio of U.S. household debt to after-tax income fell in the fourth quarter to the lowest level since 2004. Total household liabilities were 117.5 percent of disposable income during the October-December period, down from 118.2 percent in the previous quarter, according to Reuters' calculations based on the Fed's \"Flow of Funds\" report. Consumer credit swelled by 6.9 percent during the October-December period. Households continued to shed mortgage debt, which makes up the majority of their liabilities and declined at a 1.5 percent annual rate. The pace of the decline in mortgage debt was the slowest in two years. A jump in the value of financial assets pushed household net worth higher to $58.455 trillion, even though a fall in the value of real estate tempered the gains. Households have struggled to rebuild their net worth after the country's housing bubble popped and triggered the 2007-2009 recession. Non-financial corporate businesses held $2.233 trillion in liquid assets, such as cash, in the fourth quarter, up from $2.120 trillion in the previous quarter, the data showed. The growing mountain of cash suggests companies are still leery about investing. (Reporting by  Jason Lange ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )\n",

      " HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Convicted swindler Allen Stanford should forfeit some $330 million stashed in foreign bank accounts, a jury found on Thursday. \n",
      " The verdict clears the way for the U.S. government to try to seize the funds and return them to investors. Stanford was convicted on Tuesday in federal court in Houston of running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. During a six-week trial, prosecutors said Stanford stole the deposits of investors in Stanford International Bank in Antigua to fund a lavish lifestyle of girlfriends, mansions, private jets and yachts. The same court then considered whether funds held in 29 accounts in Canada, Switzerland, Britain and other countries should be forfeited. The accounts are mainly in the name of Stanford International Bank, which Stanford owned, and in the name of Stanford himself. One of the accounts, called \"Baby Mama,\" was in the name of Rebecca Reeves-Stanford, the mother of two of Stanford's children. During the forfeiture proceedings, prosecutors said they traced the money in the accounts back to deposits in Stanford International Bank. But Stanford's defense lawyers said the former financier's business was viable until the government shut it down and seized its U.S. assets in February of 2009. SOMBER Stanford looked somber as the jury delivered its forfeiture verdict. He shook his head repeatedly as U.S. District Judge David Hittner thanked the attorneys for presenting what he called an academically rigorous case over the past six weeks. Robert Scardino, one of Stanford's lawyers, said afterward that he would consider appealing a ruling by Hittner in December that Stanford was competent to be tried. \"Our client spent almost nine months in a mental facility in North Carolina before trial,\" he said. \"We had 30 days with a competent client.\" While awaiting trial, Stanford suffered a brain injury in a fight with another inmate. He then became addicted to an anti-anxiety medication. The combination left him without memory of events before the fight, making him unable to help with his defense, his lawyers said Thursday's verdict kicks off what is likely to be a long process for investors hoping to recover lost money. Receiver Ralph Janvey is pursuing funds for investors in the United States. There are also two receivers in Antigua who are pursuing the same foreign bank accounts that the U.S. government would like to seize. Janvey has just $113 million cash on hand, so the $330 million in foreign accounts could be the largest pool available to Stanford investors. \"We're all pretty devastated as a family,\" Stanford's mother, Sammie Stanford, told reporters on Thursday. She and one of Stanford's daughters later left the court, carrying the suits and shirts Stanford wore during the trial. The case is USA v. Stanford et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, No. 09r-00342. (Reporting by Anna Driver,  Erwin Seba  and  Chris Baltimore ; Editing by  Matthew Lewis )\n",

After converting existing accounts in 24 Western states last year, the San Francisco-based bank is working on accounts in Eastern states, where it gained its first branches through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia Corp. Accounts in its remaining East coast states will eventually be converted, spokeswoman Richele Messick said. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, began notifying customers in the six states of the change this week. The fee will appear in June bank statements. Customers can get a $2 discount by eschewing paper statements. In recent years, banks have been doing away with free checking accounts as new regulations curb fees on overdrafts and other charges. Banks typically charge customers monthly fees, unless they choose to do more business with the bank. Wells Fargo ended free checking for new customers in July 2010. It expects 80 percent of its customers to waive monthly maintenance fees by keeping minimum balances and taking other actions. The Essential account is not available to new customers, who must pay $5 per month for a basic account, unless they keep a $1,500 minimum daily balance or have a direct monthly deposit of at least $250 in one lump sum. This year, Wells Fargo also eliminated one of the ways customers could avoid monthly maintenance fees on its premium $10- and $15-per month accounts. Customers can no longer waive this fee by setting up a monthly automatic transfer to a savings account. Messick, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said the bank wants customers to contact it. \"We can talk to them about their needs and make sure they are in the right accounts,\" she said.

      " FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank signaled its policy course was slowly turning on Thursday, delivering a surprise warning on inflation and calling governments and banks to build on its recent blitz of radical support measures to foster a full crisis recovery. \n",
      " The ECB kept interest rates at a record of low of 1 percent for a third month running as expected, after completing two monster injections of cheap cash which have flushed over a trillion euros of three-year money into the euro zone. Despite lowering its euro zone growth forecasts, it strengthened its rhetoric about a euro zone recovery, saying there were signs of a pick up, rather than the phrase \"tentative signs\" it has used since the start of the year. The central bank also raised its forecasts for inflation this year, partly because of climbing oil prices. \"At least for the time being, a rate cut is clearly off the table ... they took away the easing bias,\" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. \"They sounded a bit more positive but staff projections were worse ... at least the chance of the euro zone falling off the cliff is very low right now.\" ECB President Mario Draghi left little doubt that unless there was a relapse in the debt crisis, the bank had now done all it planned to in terms of extraordinary measures and that governments and banks needed to take up the baton. \"Both LTROs (3-year loan injections) have had such a powerful effect ... we have to see exactly how the financial landscape has changed as a result,\" Draghi told the post meeting news conference. \"I think the ball is in the governments' and the other actors' - especially banks - court to continue their reforms, to repair their balance sheets so that they can actually support the - especially banks now - support the recovery.\" MIXED FORECASTS The ECB's staff forecasts showed the euro zone economy could shrink by 0.5 percent this year and at best grow by a meager 0.3 percent, a slight downgrade of its previous estimate but more upbeat than most private sector forecasts. \"Available survey indicators confirm signs of a stabilization in the euro area economy. However, the economic outlook is still subject to downside risks,\" Draghi said. Meanwhile, a recent 20 percent rise in oil prices is rekindling inflation to some extent. It is now forecast to be higher, at between 2.1 and 2.7 percent this year, well above the ECB's target of close to but below two percent. \"Owing to rises in energy prices and indirect taxes, inflation rates are now likely to stay above 2 percent in 2012, with upside risks prevailing,\" Draghi said, the first words of warning on inflation for well over half a year. The latest Reuters poll of 74 economists taken before the meeting showed the general view was that the ECB will hold rates at 1.0 percent until well into 2013. The euro spiked after the warning on inflation although it settled lower again after the bank cut its growth forecasts. SWEETNESS AND LIGHT Draghi was in no doubt that the ECB's twin three-year funding operations, which pumped over 1 trillion euros into the euro zone banking system, had saved the currency bloc from a serious crisis. Borrowing costs for debt strugglers such as Italy and Spain have tumbled as a result and Draghi said markets, including the interbank lending market, had reopened and \"real money\" investors were returning to euro assets. \"All in all, we see that great progress has been achieved,\" he said. \"Simply compare what the situation was in November last year and what it is today.\" While the euro zone economy has stabilized over recent months, in part thanks to the ECB's back-to-back rate cuts in November and December and the twin funding operations, there are growing signs of disquiet among some at the bank. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann aired his concerns in a letter to Draghi last month. Juergen Stark, the ECB's influential former head of economics, added his criticism by telling a German newspaper on Thursday that the quality of the central bank's balance sheet was now \"shocking\". Stark was one of two German members of the ECB policymaking fraternity who quit last year in protest at policies they felt overstepped the central bank's remit. Draghi denied there was any split this time, singling out Weidmann. \"My personal relationship with Jens is excellent ... Nobody is isolated in the Governing Council and especially the Bundesbank is not isolated,\" he said. \"I really cherish the culture and the tradition of the Bundesbank.\" In his letter, which was leaked on the day of the ECB's second dose of three-year funds, Weidmann wrote about the imbalances in the euro zone's payment system, TARGET2, and the resulting risks for the Bundesbank, which would be exposed in the unlikely event of the euro zone breaking up. Draghi played down those concerns. \"The balance sheets of the other major central banks have expanded in a short period of time much more than the ECB's,\" he said. \"So at the present time, to say that the risks for the ECB balance sheet are now higher than what they are in the Fed and in Bank of England is not correct.\" (Writing by  Marc Jones  and Mike Peacock.

      " (Reuters) - The man who has paid out billions of dollars to victims of the massive 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill has been formally relieved of his duties, and a federal judge has set up a new process to let more people and businesses collect some of their money immediately. \n",
      " Thursday's order by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans follows a March 2 agreement in principle for BP Plc ( BP.L ) to pay claims by a group of plaintiffs estimated to total more than 100,000, at a cost of about $7.8 billion. The order calls for a new administrator to handle claims from the $20 billion Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF), replacing the lawyer Kenneth Feinberg. That fund had been set up to compensate fishermen, hotel owners, property owners and others for losses from the April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and subsequent oil spill. The disaster killed 11 people and unleashed an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Feinberg, who oversaw a compensation fund for victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, has received about 1.06 million claims from roughly 574,000 claimants under the GCCF, and paid out about $6.1 billion to roughly 221,000 claimants. He could not immediately be reached for comment. According to Thursday's order, claimants with final offers from Feinberg can recover 60 percent of their money immediately. If they are deemed eligible under the new program, then they may receive the remaining 40 percent or wait for new awards, which may be higher but take months to determine. Until the new program is set up, claims will be reviewed during a transition period, and successful claimants can also get 60 percent of their money. Remaining claims would be determined entirely under the new program. Lawyers on the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee, which negotiated the settlement with BP, have said the new program will be fair and transparent, although some lawyers outside that process have questioned whether it will be an improvement. \"In the new deal, God knows when you're going to get your money,\" said Daniel Becnel, a Louisiana lawyer who has many clients that have been processing claims through the GCCF. \"You don't know what to tell your client.\" A spokesman for the PSC declined to comment. Lynn Greer, a Richmond, Virginia, lawyer, will coordinate claims during the transition period. Patrick Juneau, a lawyer in Lafayette, Louisiana, will administer claims during that period and would continue in that role under the proposed court-supervised program. Through March 7, about 41 percent of the $6.1 billion GCCF payout has gone to people and businesses in Florida. Another 29 percent has gone to Louisiana, 16 percent to Alabama, 7 percent to Mississippi, 4 percent to Texas and the remainder elsewhere. By industry, retail and other services; food, beverages and lodging; and fishing and seafood processing have comprised the bulk of the allowed claims. BP said it has already paid out more than $8 billion to claimants. It still faces claims by the U.S. Department of Justice, Gulf Coast states, and its drilling partners Transocean Ltd ( RIGN.VX ) and Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) over the spill. Federal claims alone for Clean Water Act and other violations could exceed sums paid to individuals and businesses. The case is In re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig \"Deepwater Horizon\" in the Gulf of Mexico, on April 20, 2010, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, No. 10-md-02179.

      " BOSTON  (Reuters) - The deadly start to the 2012 tornado season is forcing insurers to reconsider the risks of coverage in the most storm-prone parts of the United States and industry insiders say they may have to rethink how they handle the underwriting of the reoccurring natural disasters. \n",
      " Unfortunately, homeowners may find themselves either paying substantially higher rates or not having insurance at all, as insurers try to manage their exposure to what is clearly a growing concern by diversifying geographically and tightening their standards. The U.S. insurance industry lost nearly $26 billion on tornadoes and related storms in 2011, higher than the previous record, and insurers have already lost as much as $2 billion this year. But that total is still 50 percent less than what Hurricane Katrina cost the industry in 2005. Still, more bad news could be on the horizon as the bulk of last year's losses came in April and May, and the peak of tornado season runs through July. Disaster modeler Eqecat said the total number of tornadoes recorded this year to date is more than twice the seven-year average. It was Eqecat that estimated industry losses from last week's storms at $1 billion to $2 billion. \"While it's not to the same scale as what a major hurricane could do to a Florida or the Eastern coastal states, I think the risk of severe thunderstorms is growing and awareness is growing,\" said Brad Lemons, vice president of product and pricing at Nationwide Mutual NMUIC.UL, the eighth-largest property insurer in the country. Nationwide Insurance, as with others in the industry, is trying a mix of different things like diversifying geographically to moderate its exposure to the most risky locations, tightening underwriting standards and charging more where it can. PAYING THE COST Homeowners in hard-hit states are already paying the cost this year. For example, State Farm, the country's largest home and auto insurer, received approval from regulators for a 5 percent hike in owner-occupied homeowners insurance rates in Alabama as of last November. In Mississippi, it sought a 15.8 percent rate hike for its manufactured housing coverage. Those rate rises are small in comparison to what people in Louisiana and Florida experienced post-Katrina where many people were paying double within three years. The tornadoes on Friday generated another 6,300 claims for State Farm in just the first day after impact. In a statement, State Farm said its response to risk is considered over time and not based on any one event, much like other insurers who say recent rate hikes are more about planning for the future than recovering past losses. \"While recent claims experience is often an indicator of future claims experience, catastrophe claims experience tends to be aberrational. We evaluate catastrophe claims experience over longer periods of time than we do other types of claims experience,\" the company said. The Consumer Federation of America, in a February study written by a former Texas insurance commissioner, claimed homeowners were paying 10 times more out of pocket for damage after Katrina than after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and rates have rose further since that time. It is not just homeowners, though; car owners are also feeling the pain. In tornado-hit states, new research suggests catastrophe losses are contributing directly to higher costs, even in the highly competitive world of auto insurance. \"The more we've seen tornadoes hit the Midwest, it would be a factor there,\" said Amy Danise, editorial director of Insure.com, which does comparisons on state-by-state auto insurance rates. \"When you're seeing these storms sweep through multiple times in one season, that's where you'll definitely see a correlation.\" Insure.com's survey, looking at rates from six of the largest carriers in the country, found that storm-prone states like Louisiana and Oklahoma top the list, while rates in places like Wisconsin and Maine can be as much as two-thirds less. CHANGING STANDARDS The phrase \"perfect storm\" is overused, but in last Friday's case, it might well be true. \"Nearly every factor meteorologists look for when forecasting severe thunderstorms and tornadoes was in place,\" AccuWeather said in a report Monday. Given how frequent twisters have become in the last year or so, one solution for the industry is to simply get out of the storms' way. While it is rare for an insurer to go out of business or fail outright -- 23 property and casualty insurers failed from 2008 to 2011, according to the National Conference of Insurance Guaranty Funds. Last May, Alfa Mutual stopped writing policies on older Alabama homes in the face of tornado losses. For larger insurers wary of a similar fate, that means not putting all of their eggs in one regional basket. \"As the severity of a tornado increases, as you get up to an F5, it's less about the quality of risk actually and more about the quantity of risk,\" said Erik Nikodem, a senior vice president of the AIG ( AIG.N ) unit Lexington Insurance. \"We're paying a lot of attention to the amount of the risk that we have and the aggregation of the risk in a geographic concentration.\" It also means making changes in how risks are assessed and how policies are written. Travelers ( TRV.N ), a top-10 property insurer, said in late January it is continuing to push underwriting changes to improve its profitability. \"(We) are underwriting for age and quality of roof, reassessing how we factor in the number and type of previous claims, and implementing higher minimum deductibles for weather and non-weather claims,\" CEO Jay Fishman said on a conference call with analysts.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) said it has placed broker David S. Walker on leave, after prosecutors said a 44-year-old mother of four accused of running a brothel had visited the firm to discuss an online prostitution venture. \n",
      " Manhattan prosecutors arrested Anna Gristina of Monroe, New York, on February 22 on charges of promoting prostitution. She pleaded not guilty. During her February 23 arraignment, prosecutors said she was arrested after meeting a Morgan Stanley employee at one of the firm's Manhattan offices to discuss an online venture for matching male clients with female prostitutes. Walker, a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney broker, is that employee, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that he had been placed on administrative leave until an investigation was completed. Morgan Stanley declined further comment. The source familiar with the matter said on Thursday that Walker has denied any involvement in any illegal activity. An internal Morgan Stanley probe has so far found no evidence to the contrary, nor has the firm found any evidence of involvement by other employees, the source said. Walker has not been charged with any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, Walker told a local news website, DNAinfo.com, that Gristina had \"many other connections\" at Morgan Stanley. Walker could not be reached for comment at his Morgan Stanley office. Gristina's lawyer, Peter Gleason, could not be reached for comment. During Gristina's arraignment, New York Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan told a Manhattan Criminal Court judge that \"she had been at the Morgan Stanley banker's office for a meeting in which she was trying to solicit money to fund what we believe is another illicit venture on the Internet that involves matching male clients with female prostitutes.\" Morgan Stanley searched its visitor records looking for the employee who had met with Gristina. The source said the investment bank learned of Walker's involvement with Gristina on Wednesday. Prosecutor Linehan said at the arraignment that Gristina's indictment stemmed from a five-year investigation involving hundreds of hours of surveillance of her and her associates and 50 to 100 hours of audio and video recordings. Gristina was charged with third-degree promotion of prostitution. She is due back in court May 3 and could face up to seven years in prison if convicted. The news came a week after another Morgan Stanley employee, investment banker William Bryan Jennings, was arrested by police in Darien, Connecticut, on charges he stabbed a New York taxi driver on December 22. Police said Jennings made racial slurs against the Egyptian-born driver. Regulatory records show that Walker has been a broker since 1988 and that he was an employee of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney or its predecessor firms since 1999. Walker spent the early part of his career at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney before joining Merrill Lynch in 1994, according to Walker's FINRA records. He jumped to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in 1999, joined Citigroup's ( C.N ) Smith Barney in 2005, but ended up back at Morgan Stanley when the investment bank acquired control of Smith Barney in 2009. The FINRA records show he was involved in one customer dispute, a 2004 \"account mismanagement\" complaint with no specified damages that was denied by arbitrators. (Reporting By Joseph A.

      " (Reuters) - Facebook Inc added several women- and minority-owned investment banks to the roster of underwriters for its initial public offering, following in the footsteps of General Motors Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which did the same during their own offerings. \n",
      " The No. 1 online social media network, which filed an amended IPO registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, has hired 31 banks as underwriters for its $5 billion IPO, expected to value the company at up to $100 billion Among the women- and minority-owned firms included in the deal are New York-based banks CastleOak Securities, Williams Capital Group and M.R. Beal & Co, and Chicago-based Loop Capital Markets. \"Wall Street tries to do what looks good on high-profile IPOs, and it will not go unnoticed that Facebook has chosen to bring in minority underwriters,\" said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique. \"It's not going to make or break the deal, but it will show that they're not nonchalant about the opportunities that smaller firms can offer distribution-wise.\" Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. The addition of these firms comes after Facebook was criticized by the California State Teachers' Retirement System for not including women on its board of directors. CalSTRS, the second largest pension fund in the United States, holds some ownership in Facebook and expects to be a public shareholder. In Facebook and other IPOs, these firms are only getting joint bookrunner positions, with the large Wall Street banks taking the lead spots. Women- and minority-owned investment banks have been underwriting more equity deals in recent years. They helped underwrite 20 IPOs in 2011 that raised $1.5 billion, almost double the amount raised in 2007, according to data from Thomson Reuters. In 2010 Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, spoke out against General Motors' decision not to include any underwriters from minority- or women-owned financial institutions. The Detroit automaker eventually added a handful of these banks as underwriters. Goldman Sachs also gave boutique firms Utendahl Capital Partners and Muriel Siebert & Co a more lucrative position in its IPO after discussions with civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson, according to a 1999 report from the Associated Press. Jackson had been pushing for minority businesses to have more of a presence on Wall Street. Goldman declined to comment.

      " (Reuters) - Fender Musical Instruments Corp, whose guitars have been used by music legends Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, filed with U.S. regulators on Thursday to raise up to $200 million in an initial public offering. \n",
      " Formed in the 1940s by Leo Fender, Fender was the first to mass-produce solid-body Spanish-style electric guitars, including the iconic Stratocaster. It was sold to television network CBS in 1965. When CBS started selling off its non-media businesses, then Fender Chief Executive William Schultz teamed up with some of the company's international distributors and bought out Fender in 1984. Schultz and his family trust still own about 6 percent of Scottsdale, Arizona-based Fender, according to the company's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Private equity firm Weston Presidio owns a 43 percent stake. \"Fender is using a window of opportunity here to get into portfolios of funds that look for strong brands,\" Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based IPO investment firm IPOX Schuster, told Reuters. \"It is a leader in its field. I think there will be demand for its stock.\" J.P. Morgan, Baird, Stifel Nicolaus Weisel and Wells Fargo Securities would be underwriting the offering, Fender said in the filing. The company plans to use about $100 million of the proceeds to pay off debt. Since part of the debt repayment will be made to some of the banks underwriting the offering, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulations require the offering to have a qualified independent underwriter, the filing said. William Blair & Company would act as the independent underwriter in the offering. The number of shares to be offered -- a portion of which will be sold by some stockholders -- and the price range for the offering have not yet been determined, Fender said. The company, which had net sales of $700.6 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, said it plans to apply to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"FNDR.\" The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees.

      " For the deal to progress, Athens needs to secure at least a 50 percent response rate from its creditors and for two-thirds of those to accept the deal.

Greek social security funds and other state organizations - holding about 23 billion euros of the bonds, most managed by the country's central bank -- have signed up. German banks, who hold at least 8 billion euros of Greek bonds, will accept the deal, sources said. The same goes for Portuguese and Austrian banks holding a little more than 1 billion euros. CREDITORS WHO MAY HOLD OUT: While most Greek pension funds holding Greek sovereign debt have agreed to take part, six have refused to do so having come under pressure from workers' unions worried the writedown on Greek debt holdings will affect the viability of their funds.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities, the brokerage arm of banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), is trying to lure advisers from Wall Street rivals with an unlikely pitch: \"We're actually a small boutique.\" \n",
      " Advising individual investors with stock brokers is a new addition to the wealth management business of JPMorgan, already one of the world's largest private bankers to the ultra-rich. The push makes the company a big competitor for the same top advisers coveted by Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) Merrill Lynch and UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ). About 200 brokers from those firms, as well as Barclays Plc's ( BARC.L ) Barclays Wealth, Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and others, have joined JPMorgan Securities in the three years since JPMorgan took over Bear Stearns and inherited a private-client business catering to well-heeled clients. The unit ended 2011 with 439 advisers. It expects to add up to 75 this year and reach 650 over the next four years, Chief Executive Officer Greg Quental said in an interview. \"We're seeing interest from advisers across a range of organizations,\" said Quental, noting that recent struggles at rival firms have created an opportunity to recruit and expand. BOUTIQUE PITCH Competition for top brokers is fiercer than ever, as almost every large bank wants to attract wealthy American customers. As a newcomer to this corner of the market, JPMorgan is selling itself as the best of both worlds. \"We're a boutique plugged into a massive financial institution,\" said Quental, a former Bear Stearns strategy executive who became JPMorgan Securities' CEO in August 2010. Claiming to be small may seem quite a stretch for a bank that is the largest in the United States by assets and employs 260,000 people -- roughly the population of Buffalo, New York. JPMorgan is also one of the country's largest mortgage, credit card and consumer lenders. But when it comes to the brokerage, Quental says JPMorgan Securities has just three layers: brokers, branch managers and himself. Rivals may have division, regional and branch-complex managers between brokers and the top boss. And even if it reaches its long-term goal of 1,000 brokers, JPMorgan Securities would still be tiny compared with Merrill's 16,100 advisers and Morgan Stanley's 17,600. The unit's finances have not been disclosed since 2009, when 376 brokers generated $419 million in revenue. Assuming no change in average production, JPMorgan brokers last year would have generated revenue of $490 million -- a rounding error at a bank that generated $100 billion. JPMorgan brokers are among the most productive on Wall Street, Quental said, generating revenue at an average of more than $1.1 million each last year. By comparison, UBS advisers averaged $870,000, the highest among the largest U.S. brokerage firms. Recruiters, citing advisers they have placed, say JPMorgan Securities has maintained Bear's high-end strategy and small-firm intimacy. Of course, emphasizing \"small\" is popular in the wealth management business these days. That appeals not only to advisers, but also to investors who want personalized service. Other big finance companies have created small, specialized units when they set out to attract elite investors. Merrill Lynch has its Private Banking and Investment Group, while UBS and Morgan Stanley have formed \"private wealth management\" arms. THREE WEALTH UNITS But with the brokerage, JPMorgan now has three businesses selling wealth management services: Its private bank caters to families with more than $25 million to invest, while JPMorgan Private Wealth Management requires at least $5 million. Private banks typically provide estate and tax planning, loans and a range of traditional and alternative investments. They deploy teams of specialists led by an account manager. In contrast, JPMorgan Securities is a traditional brokerage that trades stocks, bonds and other investments on commission, although it also manages portfolios for a fee. There is no minimum account size. Clients choose which unit of the bank they want to do business with, Quental said, and there is no requirement within JPMorgan Securities to ship accounts up to the private bank. \"We recognize there are clients who prefer to work with a private bank or have financial needs that are most appropriately served by a private banking model,\" he said. JPMorgan Securities has had losses, to be sure: About 100 brokers retired or moved to other firms since 2008. The biggest departure was New York broker Richard Saperstein, who in 2009 took a $10 billion book of business to HighTower Advisors. BROKER MOVEMENT The small-firm pitch will appeal to brokers at big banks, many of whom are reassessing which company they want on their business cards, Quental said. For example, the 2009 merger of Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney continues to generate integration problems and a clash of cultures, and advisers at Merrill Lynch have been vexed by management changes and Bank of America's credit woes. While Merrill brokers also say they feel pressured to sell Bank of America loans and banking products, JPMorgan Securities advisers appear to have few complaints about interaction with the parent's myriad businesses, according to recruiters. \"The question is always: 'Where does the bank end and the brokerage begin?'\" said veteran New York broker recruiter Michael Kelly. \"We're told (JPMorgan Chase CEO) Jamie Dimon is very supportive of the division and gives it lots of flexibility.\" Recruiters say a significant number of brokers tied down by crisis-era retention packages will be considering a move as those binds start to loosen this year. JPMorgan Securities generally pays recruits a bonus of about double their trailing-year fees and commissions, a veteran recruiter said, compared with 330 percent top-of-the-market deals dangled by the big Wall Street houses. That means a broker generating $2 million in revenue could leave $2.6 million on the table by choosing JPMorgan. Quental says recruits will accept less money up front in exchange for the stability and reputation of the company, as well as the opportunity to build up their practices. Scale and the capabilities it brings are an equally important part of the pitch. Over the past year, the company has upgraded technology and forged closer ties with the rest of its investment banking and consumer businesses. The unit plans to install $250 million worth of adviser workstations and build a $40 million online services platform, he said. JPMorgan Securities also offers some of the hedge funds and specialized loans available though JPMorgan Private Bank. \"Boutiques don't have those kinds of capabilities,\" Quental said. Broker Mark Glasser, who joined JPMorgan Securities in New York in September from Barclays Wealth, said his new employer gives him access to global investment research that he finds invaluable as he advises 15 families whose assets range from $10 million to \"several hundred million\" dollars. The former Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley adviser also values the financial strength of parent bank JPMorgan, as well as his access to senior management. \"It's easy to get lost in a firm with thousands and thousands of brokers,\" Glasser said.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Leading software and technology companies on Wednesday pressed President Barack Obama's administration for quick action on a new Indian government policy that they said threatens exports to the fast-growing economy. \n",
      " The Business Software Alliance, Telecommunications Industry Association and other groups said in a letter to Trade Representative Ron Kirk that they were \"deeply concerned\" by a plan that would require the Indian government to give domestic electronic goods preferential treatment in its purchases. The plan by India's Department of Information Technology's also covers \"products that have undefined 'security implications'\" and potentially software, the groups said. \"Most troubling, however, are the (Indian government's) plans to use its regulatory power to force government licensees to purchase domestic electronic products in a manner clearly inconsistent with the letter and spirit of India's WTO (World Trade Organization) commitments,\" they said in the letter. They appealed for Kirk's urgent assistance in addressing a development that could have a \"devastating\" impact on U.S. companies' competitive stance in a key market in India and damage U.S.-India trade. A copy was also sent to Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and Commerce Secretary John Bryson, who is leading a trade mission to India later this month to explore opportunities for U.S. companies to take part in infrastructure projects. The United States has run increasingly large trade deficits in advanced technology products in recent years, unlike the surpluses that were typical in the 1990s. Last year, the advanced technology trade gap was $99.3 billion. While India is a growing market for variety of U.S. exports, imports from the sub-continent have grown even faster. The U.S. trade deficit with India hit $14.54 billion in 2011, as exports rose to $21.63 billion and imports to $36.17 billion. The coalition released the letter a day after the Obama administration filed a WTO case against India for its ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat, eggs and other farm products. The United States says the ban, which India says is needed to stop the spread of bird flu, is not based on sound science. More than 100 countries currently import U.S. poultry. The White House has made enforcement a major part of its overall trade agenda. Obama, who is running for reelection this year, recently created a new interagency trade enforcement unit to crack down on unfair foreign trade practices.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Thursday defeated a Republican proposal to take quick action on the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, in a vote that will give Republicans more ammunition to criticize President Barack Obama's energy policies on the campaign trail. \n",
      " TransCanada's $7 billion project has been supported by some Democrats in the past, but Obama took the unusual step of calling some senators personally and asking them to vote against the proposal, drawing immediate fire from Republican leaders. The measure needed 60 votes to pass, but fell four short. Obama put the project on hold earlier this year pending further environmental review. Republicans argue the pipeline, which would ship oil from Canada and northern U.S. states to Texas, would create jobs and improve energy security at a time of surging gasoline prices. The project will take more than two years to build after winning all approvals. By proposing the amendment, Republicans sought to wrest the approval process from Obama's control. They have also used the proposal to highlight his decision ahead of November presidential and congressional elections, linking his delaying of the pipeline project to rising gasoline prices. \"At a moment when millions are out of work, gas prices are sky-rocketing and the Middle East is in turmoil, we've got a president who's up making phone calls trying to block a pipeline here at home. It's unbelievable,\" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Obama has supported construction of the southern leg of the pipeline, and his administration will assess a new route around an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska once it has been identified, White House spokesman Clark Stevens said. \"Once again, Republicans are trying to play politics with a pipeline project whose route has yet to be proposed,\" Stevens said. The Keystone amendment was among 30 measures - many of them energy-related - being voted on as the Senate pushes in coming days to renew funding for highways and other infrastructure projects, slated to run out at the end of March. Earlier, the Senate also defeated proposals to expand the area available for offshore oil drilling and extend the time for manufacturers to phase in new pollution regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency for industrial boilers. But the Keystone amendment attracted the most attention. The pipeline would carry crude from Canadian oil sands to Texas refineries and would also pick up U.S. crude from North Dakota and Montana along the way. With a 34-64 vote, senators also defeated a proposal from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden that would have blocked exports of oil from the pipeline, as well as refined products made from the oil. Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota, who had championed the Republican plan to advance the pipeline, said the restrictions in the Democratic alternative would have blocked the project.

      " Broadening the $18 billion-a-year deduction for American manufacturing is a cornerstone of Obama's plan to revamp corporate taxes. Under the plan, all corporations would be subject to much lower tax rates, with even bigger breaks for manufacturers. A Reuters analysis of company filings and government data shows how broadly the deduction is now used, suggesting it may be nearly impossible to keep it focused on manufacturing. Corporate America's army of tax lawyers will be at the ready. From Starbucks Corp to Time Warner Cable Inc, businesses far beyond traditional manufacturers use the benefit, Reuters found. \"If you are in the Dow Jones industrial (average), and you are not taking this deduction, there must be something wrong,\" said John Harrington, a former U.S. tax official now at law firm SNR Denton. \"It has always applied to a motley crew of activities.\" The deduction has become so deeply embedded in the economy that one-third of corporate activity qualifies for it, the Congressional Research Service said in a report last month. Obama wants to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent, with a special 25 percent rate for manufacturing. At the same time, he wants to double the deduction for \"advanced\" manufacturing, which he has not defined, and cut the break for oil and gas companies. Obama has traveled to Iowa, Wisconsin and other states to tout the tax break, which is known as Section 199. \"In America, there's always something we can do to create new jobs and new manufacturing and new security for the middle class,\" the president said in February. Critics say the manufacturing focus is in large part politics as Obama faces a potentially tough re-election fight in battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, where manufacturing is important. Meanwhile, Congress is unlikely to take any action on the tax breaks until after, perhaps long after, the November 6 vote. STARBUCKS FOOTNOTE Enacted by Congress in 2004 amid concerns about jobs leaving the United States, the tax break began as a 3 percent deduction from income derived from property manufactured, produced, grown or extracted there. Since 2010, most companies have gotten a 9 percent deduction. Pointing to the complexity, a congressional report on the law includes what is known as the \"Starbucks Footnote,\" which states that food processing qualifies, but not retail activities. That said, lawmakers made an exception that allows establishments to allocate a section of gross receipts for the break to the extent that roasted beans are used to brew the coffee. Starbucks, the eponymous coffee giant with nearly $12 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year, takes the deduction. The company said it had helped trim its tax rate by 0.8 percentage point in fiscal year 2011 and cut its 2009 rate by more than 2 points, according to a regulatory filing. Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said the deductions reflected the income from work at the company's four U.S. roasting plants, which employ 800 people, not from brewing espresso at retail stores. Time Warner Cable, with $20 billion in revenue in 2011, reaped a $14 million benefit from the break in 2011, filings at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed. A spokesman declined to comment. Filings show other users of the deduction include satellite TV provider DirecTV, which said the break helped cut its 2011 tax rate, and sports, media and entertainment company Madison Square Garden Co, which said the deduction helped defray fourth-quarter expenses. HAMBURGERS TO MINING Companies classified as manufacturers claimed $12 billion of the $18 billion in Section 199 tax deductions in 2008, the latest year that government data is available. Some critics argue that, on a relative basis, other industries benefit more. The tax break accounts for 0.2 percent of all manufacturing deductions, but it comprises about 0.5 percent of all deductions used by mining companies and 0.7 percent of those used by publishers, according to the data. \"What happens is people game the system,\" said Will McBride, an economist with the conservative Tax Foundation think tank. Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Information Foundation, a think tank funded in part by technology companies, said that even though hamburger makers might benefit, cutting the deduction would harm manufacturers. \"Many of the models that economists use still think we are a closed economy where we don't really compete with other countries,\" he said at a Senate hearing this week. CARVE OUT? It may be impossible to tell how much the benefit preserves U.S. jobs, especially as manufacturing continues to ebb. It will probably drop to 7 percent of the labor market by 2020, down from about a third in the 1950s, according to government forecasts. Obama's Simpson-Bowles commission on cutting the U.S. deficit recommended killing Section 199, the part of the IRS tax code that provides for the tax break. It proposed removing tax breaks while simultaneously lowering rates for all companies. Many tax experts contend that Obama's bid for a special manufacturing carve-out moves in the opposite direction. Lawmakers in Congress now are laying the groundwork for a revamp of the entire tax code, a process expected to take years. (Editing by  Kevin Drawbaugh ,  Howard Goller  and Lisa Von Ahn)\n"

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Corporate audit giant Ernst & Young <ERNY.UL} operates a lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., that has been hired in recent years by several corporations that were at the same time E&Y audit clients, prompting two senior lawmakers to demand closer regulatory scrutiny. \n",
      " Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ), CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) have ongoing lobbying contracts with Washington Council Ernst & Young, an E&Y unit, while also using the audit firm to review the corporations' books, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The same arrangement occurred in the past with E&Y, its lobbying unit and AT&T Inc ( T.N ), Fortress Investment Group LLC ( FIG.N ) and Transocean Ltd ( RIG.N ), records show. Those lobbying contracts ended between 2006 and 2011. U.S. rules on \"auditor independence\" include one that bars auditors from serving in an \"advocacy role\" for audit clients. The rule is focused on legal advocacy, such as providing expert witness testimony, but several accountants said the general prohibition on advocacy may cover lobbying, as well. The rules, which were beefed up nearly a decade ago after the Enron-era accounting scandals, are designed to ensure auditors are impartial when they review clients' books. Ernst & Young said Washington Council's work complied with independence rules. It was pre-approved by clients' audit committees and it was limited to tax-related issues, E&Y spokesman Charles Perkins said in an e-mailed statement. The firm does not solicit votes on legislation for E&Y audit clients, Perkins said. \"We assist clients in monitoring public policy, analyzing legislation and educating Treasury officials, the IRS, legislators, other policy makers and their staffs about the potential consequences of legislation,\" Perkins said. Accounting experts said the issue may turn on the type of work lobbyists do and whether it crosses a line into advocacy. The market-regulating U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not definitively said when lobbying could compromise an auditor's independence. \"Lobbying members of Congress on behalf of audit clients would make the auditor an advocate for the client,\" said Douglas Carmichael, former chief auditor for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a watchdog panel that regulates the auditing industry. Washington Council Ernst & Young reported taking in $12.2 million in fees from 72 lobbying clients in 2011. The unit's annual fee income has held steady since E&Y acquired the unit in 2000. Its revenue is a tiny fraction of the audit firm's global revenue of $22.9 billion for the year ending June 30, 2011. SENATORS URGE SCRUTINY Democratic Senator Carl Levin, a supporter of stricter auditor independence rules, called for scrutiny by the PCAOB in a statement sent in response to questions from Reuters. \"The PCAOB should look into whether lobbying by an accounting firm -- either directly or through a related entity on behalf of an audit client -- is the type of service that is or should be banned under the auditor independence law,\" he said. Spokespersons for the PCAOB and the SEC, which oversees the PCAOB and appoints its members, both declined to comment on whether the two organizations are looking into the matter. Ernst & Young is one of the Big Four of the global corporate audit industry. The others are Deloitte [DLTE.UL>, KPMG KPMG.UL and PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL}. All monitor legislation for clients, but E&Y alone says that its work includes educating policy-makers on behalf of audit clients. To determine whether E&Y's work counts as \"advocacy,\" the SEC could draw on two definitions of lobbying elsewhere in U.S. law. The Lobbying Disclosure Act says that making contact with government officials counts as lobbying, with some exceptions. It makes no exception for education. The tax code says that activity is not lobbying unless it has the purpose of influencing legislation. Clarification is needed from the SEC, which interprets and enforces the rules, Democratic Senator Jack Reed told Reuters. \"You will get people who will argue that lobbying does involve a degree of advocacy ... and others will say it is just simply factual education,\" Reed, the chairman of a subcommittee with jurisdiction over auditors, said in an interview. \"What is the scope of this advocacy prohibition? ... The only definitive answer will come from the SEC.\" The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires a lobbying firm to notify Congress when a new client hires the firm, if the firm expects to make more than one contact on the client's behalf and to spend 20 percent or more of its time for the client on lobbying activities. Then, a lobbying firm must file disclosure reports every calendar quarter. Those reports detail how much money the firm collected in fees, the issues it worked on, the lobbyists involved and the agencies it contacted. The reports do not say when and where lobbying meetings took place, or the lawmakers or government staff members who attended. AT&T, FORTRESS WERE CLIENTS In 2006, Ernst & Young was registered as a lobbyist for AT&T on corporate and international tax issues. The same year, E&Y audited the giant telecommunications company's books, SEC filings show. An AT&T spokeswoman defended the relationship, saying that Ernst & Young did not act as a lobbyist for the company. The lobbying disclosure reports were \"not actually necessary given the scope of services,\" AT&T spokeswoman McCall Butler said in an e-mailed response to questions. The services were \"limited to information and advisory services regarding legislative and tax issues,\" and AT&T's audit committee approved them, she said. She did not say why E&Y filed the reports if they were unnecessary. Donley Ritchey, who was AT&T's audit committee chairman in 2006, declined to comment and referred questions to AT&T. Lobbying disclosure reports say without elaboration that the AT&T-E&Y relationship ended in October 2006. Ernst & Young was auditor to private-equity firm and asset manager Fortress Investment Group in 2007. In that same year, Fortress paid $340,000 to Washington Council Ernst & Young for tax-related work, according to lobbying disclosure reports. Fortress board member Douglas Jacobs, chairman of the group's audit committee, said the committee approved the hiring of Ernst & Young to monitor developments in Washington. The committee acted appropriately, he said. He said he could not answer questions about the day-to-day details of the Fortress-E&Y relationship. He referred those to Fortress management. A Fortress spokesman declined to comment. Transocean spokesman Guy Cantwell said E&Y monitored tax issues for the offshore drilling rig operator. \"Monitoring and reporting on tax matters are permitted services under the independence rules,\" he said, adding that he did not know whether E&Y was engaged in educating lawmakers. Drugmaker Amgen, pharmacy firm CVS Caremark and phone company Verizon declined to comment. Audit committee chairmen for those companies and Transocean could not be reached. RULES SHIELD INDEPENDENCE Auditor independence rules are meant to prevent auditors from getting too cozy with the management of an audit client. The rules are based on the idea that auditors are watchdogs for investors and should not be promoting management's interests. The SEC has long held that the appearance of independence is as important as being independent in fact. \"The rules say you cannot act as an advocate for an audit client, and what constitutes advocacy really depends on specific facts and circumstances,\" SEC Chief Accountant Jim Kroeker said. \"There are certain types of lobbying that would clearly be advocacy,\" he told Reuters. The SEC requires board audit committees to review non-audit services provided by an auditor to ensure independence is protected. Companies in the past have sought guidance from the SEC to be sure certain activities would not violate the rules. Ernst & Young declined to comment on whether it consulted the SEC before registering as a lobbyist for audit clients, but said it took \"appropriate steps\" to be sure it complied with independence rules. Auditor independence has been under renewed scrutiny since the 2007-2009 credit crisis, when auditors were widely criticized for not flagging risks at major banks and financial firms that failed or had to be propped up with government funds. U.S. and EU regulators are considering sweeping changes designed to ensure auditors are more skeptical. E&Y SUSPENDED IN 2004 Independence is an especially sensitive issue for Ernst & Young, which was suspended in 2004 from accepting new public company audit clients for six months because of alleged violations of independence rules. The suspension stemmed from a joint venture Ernst had in the 1990s with business software provider PeopleSoft, now part of Oracle Corp ORCL.O, when Ernst was also auditing PeopleSoft's books. An SEC administrative law judge ordered Ernst & Young to disgorge $1.7 million in audit fees and issued a cease-and-desist order against future independence violations. Independent lobbying firms that hire out lobbyists to clients are commonplace in Washington, D.C. In 2000, Ernst & Young bought one of them, then known as Washington Counsel, and changed its name to Washington Council Ernst & Young. Deloitte has a legislative affairs group that monitors tax proposals in Washington, but it does not offer lobbying services of any kind, said Deloitte spokeswoman Kathryn Metcalfe. It has no registered lobbying clients. KPMG advertises legislative services such as analysis and briefings on pending bills. The firm has one registered lobbying client, a coalition related to fisheries issues. \"We do only a small amount of tax lobbying for firm clients and it is always disclosed in full compliance with the law,\" KPMG spokesman Jim McGann said. Compared with E&Y, PricewaterhouseCoopers sells lobbying services on a smaller scale. It cut back on the business line in 2002, selling its lobbying arm, Federal Policy Group, as audit firms came under scrutiny for non-audit work. PwC collected $1.8 million from 11 lobbying clients in 2011. Most of them were trade associations and industry coalitions. \"As a matter of firm policy and, in part, due to auditor independence requirements, PwC does not lobby for audit clients,\" said Laura Cox Kaplan, head of government, regulatory affairs and public policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers.

      " ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek unemployment hit another record high in December and for the first time the number of young people without a job outnumbered those in work. \n",
      " Statistics service ELSTAT said on Thursday that the overall jobless rate rose to 21 percent from 20.9 percent in November, twice the euro zone rate. The average unemployment rate for 2011 jumped to 17.3 percent from 12.5 percent in the previous year, according to the figures, which are not adjusted for seasonal factors. Youth were particularly hit. For the first time on record, more people between 15-24 years were without a job than with one. Unemployment in that age group rose to 51.1 percent, twice as high as three years ago. Budget cuts imposed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund as a condition for saving the debt-laden country from a chaotic default have caused a wave of corporate closures and bankruptcies. Greece's economy is estimated to have shrunk by a about a fifth since 2008, when it plunged into its deepest and longest post-war recession. About 600,000 jobs, more than one in ten, have been destroyed in the process. Things will get worse before they get better, according to analysts. \"Despite some emergency government measures to boost employment in early 2012, it is hard to see how the upward unemployment trend can be stabilized in the first half of the year,\" said Nikos Magginas, an economist at National Bank of Greece. A record 1,033,507 people were without work in December, 41 percent more than in the same month last year. The number in work dropped to a record low of 3,899,319, down 7.9 percent year-on-year. Pressured by its international backers under the terms of a planned European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout, the country's second since 2010, Greece last month slashed its minimum monthly wage by about a fifth to about 580 euros ($760), gross, to encourage hirings. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, however, said on Wednesday this was still higher than other debt-laden countries such as Spain. The average jobless rate in the 17 countries sharing the euro rose slightly in December to a seasonally adjusted 10.6 percent, from 10.5 percent in November.

      " The California State Teachers Retirement System said it would vote its approximately 2.8 million shares of El Paso stock against the merger. El Paso has about 773 million shares outstanding, according to Thomson Reuters data. \"We have concerns with the lack of transparency and the apparent conflicts of interest that have surrounded the share appraisal process and we believe that shareholders may not receive full value for their shares should this transaction, as currently structured, be consummated,\" a CalSTRS spokesman said. A shareholder group sued in January to stop the deal, arguing that El Paso adviser Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and El Paso Chief Executive Douglas Foshee had vested interests in holding down the price for the company. Goldman Sachs advised El Paso on the deal but also owns a sizable stake in acquirer Kinder Morgan through its private equity arm. A Delaware judge called the negotiating process \"disturbing\" in a ruling last week, but refused to block the acquisition, saying shareholders should decide for themselves if they want to accept the deal. El Paso delayed a planned vote on the deal after the ruling, moving the meeting at which shareholders will vote on the deal to Friday from Tuesday. While shareholders can still change their votes before the meeting, the company said on Monday that about 70 percent of its outstanding shares had already been voted as of March 2. More than 98.5 percent of those shares were voted in favor of the deal, El Paso said. The company needs a majority of the votes cast in order to receive shareholder approval of the sale. The deal was worth around $21 billion at the time it was announced in October, but the value of the proposed tie-up has risen, along with Kinder Morgan's stock price, since then. El Paso shares closed up 1.2 percent at $28.42 and Kinder Morgan closed up 2.7 percent at $36.30, both on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

      " DALLAS  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday that he saw no risk to the dollar from China's efforts to encourage other emerging market economies to use the yuan more in international trade. \n",
      " \"What you're seeing China do is gradually dismantle what were a comprehensive set of very, very tight controls on the ability of countries to use their (the Chinese) currency,\" Geithner told an event at the Dallas Regional Chamber. \"Over time that will mean - and this is a good thing for the United States - more use of that currency and it will mean the currency will have to reflect market forces ... So, I see no risk to the dollar in those reforms,\" he said. China is planning to extend renminbi-denominated loans to its fellow BRICS countries - a grouping that includes China, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and India - in an attempt to boost trade between the leading emerging market nations and promote the use of the yuan, according to the Financial Times. Geithner said he was skeptical the yuan, or renminbi, would soon become a world currency. \"I don't think so. I don't know, maybe in some long time after we're all gone, it would be possible,\" Geithner said after he toured a railcar facility here. However, China's transition from an economy fueled by exports to one driven more by domestic demand is partly why the value of China's currency \"is moving up against the dollar,\" he added. In Dallas to meet with regional business leaders and promote the Obama administration's economic policies, Geithner also said the United States' government could afford to extend tax breaks for middle-class Americans beyond the end of the year. Individual tax cuts enacted under the Bush administration expire December 31 and the Obama administration wants to allow tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans expire. On Thursday, Geithner repeated that the tax burden on the top 2 percent of Americans had to go up again \"as part of a balanced plan to bring down our fiscal deficits down to a sustainable level.\" \"There is no real alternative to doing that,\" the U.S. Treasury secretary added. \"Those should be allowed to expire, but the middle-class tax cuts we think we can afford to extend.\" (Recasts headline) (Reporting by Jon Nielsen,  Doug Palmer ,  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by Gary Crosse)\n",

      " The markets, however, is likely to remain volatile ahead of a deadline this evening on the Greek bond swap offer to private creditors, and also ahead of Friday's keenly-watched U.S. jobs report. \"This has been the game of anticipation. I think it's likely to remain volatile but overall ... we would be expecting more upside potential moving into next week,\" Luca Solca, global head of European research at CA Cheuvreux, said. \"I think the rally would take shape expanding into higher beta names, we have been expanding into stocks like Commerzbank.\" Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ), whose beta of 1.8 suggests it is 80 percent more volatile than the broader market, added 2.3 percent. The banking sector as a whole, whose sovereign debt holdings make it highly sensitive to the fresh twists and turns of the Greek debt saga, added 2 percent .SX7P. The Euro STOXX 50 index of euro zone blue chips rose 1 percent to 2,469.34 points  .STOXX50E , extending gains partly on speculation that China could loosen monetary policy to stimulate economic growth. After finding support at the 50-day moving average around 2,444 on Wednesday, the Euro STOXX 50 still has around 50 points to climb to reverse a steep sell off seen on Tuesday. According to technical analysts at Day By Day, the index remains in a correction phase from this year's rally - which has taken it up 8.7 percent in 2-1/2 months - between 2,398 and 2,495 points. For some, though, the more upbeat market mood is a reason to start selling. BNP Paribas' European Love-Panic indicator, designed to track price action attributed to investor sentiment rather than fundamentals, has moved into convincingly positive territory, which the bank interprets as a signal to buy protection against possible weakness. It recommends a September 2012 options trade known as a \"put ladder\" on the Euro STOXX 50 at 2,540, 2,200 and 1,950 for a 1.9 percent premium. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Asset returns in 2012: link.reuters.com/nyw85s Euro zone debt crisis in graphics: r.reuters.com/hyb65p ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> The broader FTSE Eurofirst 300  .FTEU3  added 1.2 percent to 1,063.87. Among individual stocks, companies with global exposure performed strongly, while those relying on domestic consumers suffered as high unemployment led people to tighten their belts, hurting profits. Belgian supermarket group Delhaize ( DELB.BR ) and German consumer goods group Henkel ( HNKG_p.DE ) fell after posting weaker than expected results. Enel ( ENEI.MI ), Europe's most indebted utility, lost 6.3 percent on its plans to cut its dividend and investments over the next five years. But AB InBev ( ABI.BR ), the world's largest brewer, added 3 percent after painting an upbeat outlook for this year as it looks to drinkers outside Europe - in the United States and Brazil - to drive profits. EADS ( EAD.PA ), who sells jets to clients as far afield as Middle East and China, added 9 percent to lead the FTSE Eurofirst leader board after predicting a \"significant\" improvement in operating profit for 2012 and posting forecast-beating earnings for 2011. Few surprises are expected from Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings on Thursday. Both banks are seen leaving interest rates on hold. The ECB is likely to give markets time to absorb last month's liquidity injections before considering any more such measures. The next big catalyst for markets is likely to be the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday. Wednesday's private sector employment data boosted expectations of a strong number, with the next clue coming from the weekly jobs numbers at 1330 GMT. Consensus is for 210,000 new jobs to have been added in February. If the actual number is 100,000 higher, the Euro STOXX 50 index could add 0.7 percent shortly after publication of the report, according to Societe Generale research. However, based on long-term fair value, the bank also says that the consensus reading for the jobs number is in-line with a Euro STOXX 50 value of around 2,400 points, a bit below current levels.

      " The 2011 payout included salary of $1.7 million and cash supplemented by a cash bonus of $5.3 million and options valued at $7.8 million. In 2010, Pandit's total pay package was $128,751. The pay recognizes Pandit's shepherding of the company to profitability after the bank was bailed out by the government in 2008. Citi, which had net income of $11.1 billion in 2011, has had eight consecutive quarters of profitability, Citigroup's compensation committee said in the company's annual proxy statement. \"The committee awarded annual incentive compensation, in addition to salary, to Mr. Pandit for the first time in four years in a manner commensurate with his responsibilities and the success of his implementation of Citi's long term strategies,\" the proxy statement said. About $8 million of Pandit's 2011 pay is split between deferred stock and deferred cash. The awards, meant to retain the executive, vests in four annual installments beginning January 2012, the proxy said.

      " BERLIN  (Reuters) - The head of Qatar Airways, usually one of the aircraft industry's fiercest critics, expressed confidence that Airbus and Boeing would resolve a series of high-profile glitches but warned against further production delays. \n",
      " The endorsements from a top industry figure best known for lambasting manufacturers over delays will come as a relief to both planemakers as they count the cost of recent mishaps. Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said it was normal for new aircraft such as the Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A380 superjumbo and the Boeing ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner to have teething problems and stressed safety was not an issue. He also seemed satisfied with Boeing's production plans for its new 787 Dreamliner, although many analysts have described the company's plans to boost production to 10 aircraft a month by end-2013 from 2.5 now as optimistic. \"The 787 will be a very good airplane. I am confident,\" Al Baker told Reuters at a trade show on Wednesday. \"I cannot discuss the details, but I can tell you that they have a very achievable ramp-up strategy,\" he said after being briefed on the plans for record wide-body aircraft production. Boeing is grappling with a problem of delamination or the separation of bonded layers in part of the composite structure of its lightweight Dreamliner, while Airbus is wrestling with a series of cracks on components inside the wings of its A380 superjumbo. \"I think they will solve the problems with the A380. It is not a big issue...it is an aircraft that is in its infancy,\" said Al Baker. Analysts say Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) may take a charge of some 100 million euros for the cost of repairing the cracks and Airbus CEO Tom Enders has told staff the A380's reputation is at stake and that no costs will be spared to resolve this. EADS will report 2011 earnings on Thursday. Al Baker's remarks at a major travel industry event in Berlin contrast with his comments during the Dubai air show in November when he questioned whether Airbus was \"still learning how to build aircraft\". He has also recently criticized the Boeing 747-8 for being overweight and burning too much fuel. 777 PLANS Qatar is due to receive its first of 30 787s in June and its first A380 in 2013. With plans to unveil the 787 at the Farnborough air show in July, including lavish seats and entertainment consoles previewed on Wednesday, Al Baker said he would not accept any more delays to the 787, which is about 3 years late. He also warned Airbus against extending a six-month delay for the first variant of its future A350, the European company's answer to the Dreamliner. Qatar now expects to receive the first of 80 planes in mid-2014 instead of late 2013. He repeated criticism of Airbus designs for the largest type of A350 -- the 370-passenger A350-1000 due in 2017, which has also failed to impress other Gulf carriers -- but said the designers had time to come up with improvements. Airbus and Boeing are involved in a tug of war over the direction of the lucrative 'mini-jumbo' market, which is so far dominated by the still fast-selling Boeing 777. Airbus says its plane will replace the 777-300ER but Al Baker rejected this. He said he was \"satisfied\" with proposals for a new 777 presented in confidential briefings. Boeing has said it will decide what to do in this part of the market later this year. In a boost for Airbus, however, Qatar threw its weight behind the planemaker's latest project by expressing interest in converting up to 20 of its A330 passenger jets into freighters. Al Baker had previously threatened to buy converted Boeing 767 aircraft because of a gap in Airbus's cargo strategy. The plans would involve giving a second life hauling cargo to mid-sized passenger jets. Qatar operates six freighters but is not interested in buying new ones because the economics are not right, so it prefers to convert jetliners, Al Baker said. Some in the $100 billion annual aircraft industry dismiss Al Baker's headline-grabbing criticisms as a negotiating ploy, but he insists he is defending the interests of an airline which is in the throes of dramatic expansion alongside others in the Gulf. \"When I need to criticize them (Airbus and Boeing) to wake them up I will and when they are doing things correctly, I should also give them credit,\" he told a news conference. \"I am known to be outspoken but I am also known to be fair. I am not on anyone's payroll and I am looking at everything from the point of view of Qatar Airways.\" He also played down speculation that Qatar Airways would buy airlines in financial difficulties in Europe and said it had shelved plans to buy the new CSeries being developed by Canada's Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ), but had \"not written the CSeries off\".

      " PARIS  (Reuters) - The International Energy Agency said on Thursday it was closely monitoring a pipeline outage that has halted a fifth of U.S. crude imports and added over $3 to oil prices. \n",
      "\n",
      " The IEA, which advises 26 industrialized nations, can tap its members' emergency reserves to prevent a global energy crisis. Lawrence Eagles, head of the IEA's oil and industry markets division, said it was too early to say how much of an impact the incident will have on the market. An explosion hit a main pipeline that supplies Canadian crude to U.S. Midwest refineries on Wednesday, forcing operator Enbridge Inc to shut down four of its main pipelines. \"With any supply issue, we always monitor what is going on,\" But we have to have a better understanding of what the issue is at this point in time before making any comment,\" he said. \"You have to look at whether there are opportunities for re-routing supplies...and how long it's going to take for repairs,\" he added. The pipeline carries an estimated 1.9 million barrels per day of Canadian crude to the United States, equivalent to about 9 percent of total U.S. oil demand. STANDS READY The last time the IEA released some of its emergency reserves was at the end of 2005 in the wake of Hurricane Katrina which devastated U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production. That release included refined oil products. A need for crude oil alone would most likely be met from U.S. strategic stocks. The IEA, created after the 1973-74 oil crisis, requires member countries to hold stocks of at least 90 days of net imports. But a continued rise in oil demand, an increased concentration of the remaining oil reserves in fewer countries, and a lack of upstream and downstream capacity additions are forcing the IEA to mount its preparedness in case of a crisis. In a report released before the pipeline explosion, the IEA said it stood ready for the growing risk of oil supply disruptions. \"The risk of oil supply disruptions has grown in recent years and will grow in the near future,\" it said in a new publication on oil supply security. \"But the IEA stands prepared.\" Oil stocks in member countries have grown by 14 percent since 2000 to 4.1 billion barrels at the end of 2006, when total stocks covered 122 days of net imports against an all-time low of 108 days in 2000.

      " CHICAGO  (Reuters) - H.J. Heinz Co HNZ.N posted an 18 percent jump in quarterly profit on Thursday as the weak U.S. dollar improved results in Europe and emerging markets, and price increases helped offset rising ingredient costs. \n",
      "\n",
      " The maker of Heinz ketchup, Ore-Ida potatoes and Smart Ones frozen meals also raised the top end of its fiscal 2008 earnings forecast as new products and a 23 percent increase in marketing lifted sales. Profit rose to $227 million, or 71 cents a share, in the company's fiscal second quarter, ended October 31, from $191.6 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 67 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 13 percent to $2.52 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 8.1 percent . Like most U.S. food companies, Heinz has been facing higher costs for corn-based sweetener, dairy products and other ingredients. The company has raised prices and improved productivity to offset these higher expenses. Heinz said it now expects commodity costs to be up more than 7 percent this year, higher than the  5.5 percent the company forecast three months ago. With about 60 percent of Heinz's sales coming from outside the United States, sales made in euros and other strong currencies have in part offset rising commodity costs, Chief Financial Officer Art Winkleblack said during a conference call with analysts. \"Our plan is to continue pricing up and aggressively drive productivity initiatives to offset the escalating commodity cost in the industry,\" Winkleblack said. Sales in the North American consumer products business rose 9.7 percent and profit in that business was up about 7 percent. Heinz Europe sales climbed 18 percent and profit rose 14.8 percent. Asia/Pacific sales rose 16.8 percent and profit increased 21.8 percent. But profit in the U.S. food service fell 13.5 percent, hurt by rising dairy costs and a 1.7 percent decrease in volume, a measure of products shipped that factors out price and currency fluctuations. Heinz said it now expects to earn $2.54 to $2.62 per share for the full fiscal year. It previously forecast $2.54 to $2.60. Analysts' average estimate is $2.61, according to Reuters Estimates. Heinz shares rose 26 cents to $47.45 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up about 5 percent this year, compared with a 3 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's U.S. packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD. (Reporting by Brad Dorfman; editing by Steve Orlofsky)\n"

      "\n",
      " The $1.2 million campaign in partnership with community groups and nonprofit housing counselors comes as California suffers steep jumps in foreclosure rates in some of its housing markets, threatening to roil the finances of local governments there and slow the economy of the most populous U.S. state. Schwarzenegger, at a press conference in Riverside County, whose housing market has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation, said the effort aims to prevent more than 100,000 California families from losing their homes. The effort will be aimed at educating borrowers whose mortgages have or will become too expensive after low initial interest rates reset at higher levels, telling them how to contact their lenders and on the perils of avoiding them. \"It's a two-way street that got us into this mess,\" Schwarzenegger said at the press conference, aired on his Web site, adding it is imperative for borrowers and lenders to work together to strike deals to prevent foreclosures. Schwarzenegger also said he would press more lenders to join the four -- Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, GMAC GMA.N, Litton Loan Servicing LP and HomeEq Servicing Corp -- who signed on last week to a loan modification program negotiated by his office and based on a proposal by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Sheila Bair. The four lenders agreed to allow many potentially distressed borrowers in California to keep low rates on their home loans.

      " BEIJING  (Reuters) - China has published a blacklist of substandard toy jugs and children's shoes sold at Wal-Mart stores and drawing pens from French retailer Carrefour in a quality sweep on children's goods sold at Beijing supermarkets. \n",
      "\n",
      " China has been buffeted by food, drug and other product safety scares in past months. More than 20 million toys made there have been recalled worldwide over the past four months. In response, Beijing has promised to crack down on faulty manufacturers and suppliers, but also said much responsibility lies with foreign regulators and buyers. It has also made a point of naming foreign companies it claims also have problem products. A Wal-Mart Stores Inc spokesman, Jonathan Dong, said the blacklist -- which appeared on an official Web site on Thursday -- was more than two months old and the products, made in China, had long been cleared from the shelves. Inspectors had also blacklisted children's toys at Wal-Mart stores in Beijing for problems regarding parts that could come off and cause harm if swallowed, the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce said on its Web site (www.hd315.gov.cn). The 54-item blacklist also included substandard children's glasses, toothbrushes, building blocks and bikes with shoddy brakes and handlebars, at a number of Chinese retailers. \"If consumers have bought the substandard goods, with proof of purchase they can request the vendor to recall the goods,\" the notice said. Six children's products stocked at Wal-Mart branches in Beijing had failed to meet standards, the notice said. Wal-Mart's \"Bo bo\" brand of \"water jugs\" had failed plastic integrity standards, according to the notice. \"Over a long period of use, toxins could accumulate in the body and cause harm,\" the notice said. Wal-Mart spokesman Dong confirmed the blacklist and said the retailer had been notified of the quality results. He said he was not sure why the notice had appeared on the Web site on Thursday. \"I guess they just wanted to be transparent about it,\" he said. Dong said any versions of the products now on sale had been deemed safe, but customers with doubts could nonetheless return them. Last week, Wal-Mart was one of 20 companies sued by the California attorney general and Los Angeles city attorney for manufacturing or selling toys with unlawfully high levels of lead. Chinese-made Carrefour drawing pens were found with excessive levels of lead and chromium. A Carrefour spokesman contacted by phone was unable to provide immediate comment and requested an e-mail of questions. The Chinese producer of the bead toys that caused recalls in the United States and Australia has apologized for using a toxic \"date-rape\" drug and damaging the reputation of the made-in-China label, state media said on Thursday. Vice Premier Wu Yi arrived in Guangdong on Wednesday for \"secret\" spot checks on food safety, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported. She heads one of 12 inspection teams that were checking hundreds of outlets on Thursday, officials were quoted as saying.\n",

      " COLUMBIA, Maryland  (Reuters) - Retailers may be touting their environmental-friendliness this year, but just about the only \"green\" in evidence for the holidays is in the usual Christmas decorations. \n",
      "\n",
      " Thick catalogs continue to clog mailboxes, store personnel keep handing out free gift boxes, and plastic bags are everywhere. There is little to no signage in stores emphasizing eco-friendly products, beyond those at select chains known for their environmental thrust. \"There are a lot of stories in the media about 'green,'\" said Laurie Brooks, a spokeswoman for L.L. Bean, which sells clothing and outdoor gear. \"I think it really hasn't trickled down to the consumer level yet.\" And amid fears that shoppers may clamp down on holiday spending in the wake of higher food and fuel prices, the slowing U.S housing market and the credit crunch, retailers are loath to do anything to turn off their clientele. \"The consumer is consumed with other things, and very rarely have they ever endorsed and embraced the green endeavors,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at research firm NPD Group. GREEN BEHIND THE SCENES As fears over global warming have dominated headlines this year, numerous retailers have announced new and expanded plans to cut down on waste and run stores more efficiently. Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), which has a goal of one day being supplied 100 percent by renewable energy and creating zero waste, is pushing its vendors to reduce the amount of packaging they use and make products that consume less power. Department store operator Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) is working on implementing rooftop solar energy systems, while consumer electronics chain Best Buy Co Inc ( BBY.N ) is giving grants to organizations that hold electronics recycling events. But this holiday season, there is a divide between the environmental tactics retailers are implementing behind the scenes -- like building stores with recycled materials or using hybrid vehicles -- and the shopping experience they provide. During the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, a Wal-Mart store in Columbia, Maryland, had no displays of the efforts the world's largest retailer is making to go green. And at a nearby L.L. Bean store, shoppers could scoop up as many boxes as they wanted. Brooks said L.L. Bean did not actively promote its environmental efforts to its customers, but she said the gift boxes the retailer handed out were recyclable and made from recycled content. While the company has not cut down on the catalogs it mails, they contain a higher percentage of recycled content, she said. L.L. Bean has also retrofitted stores with energy-efficient lighting and converted its trucks to biodiesel fuel. \"These are things that aren't really visible to customers,\" she said. \"We're doing it behind the scenes.\" MISSED OPPORTUNITY? Stacy Janiak, U.S. retail leader at Deloitte, said retailers were missing a valuable opportunity by not promoting green products or eco-friendly business practices. According to a survey commissioned by Deloitte, 18 percent of respondents said they would purchase more eco-friendly products this holiday season than in the past, and 17 percent said they will shop at more green retailers. \"Another key fact from the survey was that 17 percent said they're willing to pay more for green gifts,\" Janiak said. \"That's a big marketing opportunity for retailers. If they're not taking advantage of it this holiday season, you can bet they're going to through the upcoming year.\" One retailer making a big push is upscale department store operator Barneys, which sent out a catalog emblazoned with the words, \"Have a Green Holiday.\" Not worried about its higher-end customers pulling back on spending, it is advertising organic cotton products like a $595 dress and a $68 T-shirt. But many retailers are debating how far they should push the green concept and whether customers even want these items. Brooks said L.L. Bean had not seen an overwhelming demand for more organic cotton or bamboo products. A spokeswoman for Target Corp ( TGT.N ) said that while the discounter sells items like organic cotton sheets and energy-efficient lighting, it was not incorporating a green message into its holiday marketing. Wal-Mart also said it did not have a green marketing plan in place for Christmas. Although J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) opened a new department store to test eco-friendly building methods, a spokesman said it was too soon to make a big push to sell and promote green merchandise. \"It's something that is growing in importance with the customer,\" he said, but added: \"It's early days.\" But NPD's Cohen said the green trend was already over. \"It's basically a card that a lot of people played while it was hot and trendy,\" he said. \"And it got overplayed.\" (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)\n"

Many cities and states where prices are slumping the most had staged the biggest price surges earlier in the decade, OFHEO said. \"Rising inventories of for-sale properties are clearly having a material impact on home prices,\" OFHEO Chief Economist Patrick Lawler said in the statement. \"Until those inventories shrink, that will be a great source of resistance to price increases.\" Home foreclosures are boosting the supply of unsold homes and also pressing on prices. \"Compounding this influence is the fact that the sellers of foreclosed homes, frequently creditors, may be strongly averse to holding onto the property for an extended period of time. As a result, they may be willing to sell for lower prices than resident homeowners,\" OFHEO said in its report. Falling prices mean more homeowners without equity, meaning the value of their house is less than their mortgage balance. Owners in this situation may just walk away from the property and mortgage, OFHEO said. REPORTS DIVERGE BUT STORY SIMILAR While OFHEO still shows home prices up over the year, in stark contrast the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, the path of the gauges is similar. Home prices are appreciating less or dropping in a growing number of states. The S&P/Case-Shiller index this week showed prices slid 4.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, matching a record drop from the prior period. In the quarter, the index dropped 1.7 percent from the second quarter, its biggest quarterly drop in the index's 21 year history. OFHEO, for its part, said its index \"weights sales prices differently than other measures, incorporates data from a wider geographic area and is focused on homes with conventional, conforming loans.\" Conforming loans are $417,000 or less, and thus can be purchased by top U.S. home funding companies Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. OFHEO's index tracks average single-family house price change in repeat sales or refinancings of the same homes, and is based on data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. WINNERS, LOSERS Michigan, California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Rhode Island had the biggest price declines over the year, OFHEO said. Prices fell 3.7 percent in Michigan, 3.6 percent in California and 2.4 percent in Nevada. Prices in states such as California and Nevada surged earlier this decade, driven by speculators looking to quickly sell at a profit. Many of those owners are now stuck with empty homes they cannot turn around even as prices sink. Seventeen of the 20 cities with the most annual price depreciation were in Florida, another state with heavy speculative buying, and California, OFHEO said. Utah, Wyoming, Montana and New Mexico had the fastest price appreciation over the year. Prices rose 12.9 percent in Utah, 11.8 percent in Wyoming, 7.7 percent in Montana and 7.4 percent in New Mexico.\n",

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Soft sales and plunging prices for new homes, together with a surge in claims for new jobless benefits highlighted a slide in U.S. economic activity that forced the Bush administration on Thursday to scale back its estimate for growth in 2008. \n",
      "\n",
      " A day after Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said economic uncertainties were \"unusually high\" and no end was in sight to the housing slump, the Commerce Department said median home sales prices in October tumbled at the steepest rate since 1970 on a year-over-year basis to $217,800, a 13 percent drop. That took the glow off a separate report from the Commerce Department that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of national economic activity, climbed at a revised 4.9 percent rate in the third quarter, its best performance in four years. Previously, the department said third-quarter growth was at a 3.9 percent rate, but even the revised figure was largely dismissed as old data by financial market participants more preoccupied with risks a downturn could become a recession. NEW, DARKER WORLD \"It is a completely different world now and we expect GDP to actually contract over the final three months of this year,\" said Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics Inc in London. \"The chances of an outright recession -- two quarters of negative growth -- are probably as high as 50-50.\" Stock prices ended the day little changed, with the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  off 9.43 points to 13,280 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  down 4.55 points to 2,658. But bond prices jumped as investors sought safer haven than stocks. Two-year notes traded 6/32 higher in price for a yield of 3.07 percent, down from 3.19 percent late on Wednesday, while 5-year notes rose 13/32 for a yield of 3.41 percent compared with 3.50 percent a day earlier. The White House acknowledged that economic prospects were suffering, recasting its estimates for 2008 GDP growth downward to 2.7 percent from 3.1 percent that it forecast in June. In an interview from Los Angeles, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said 2.7 percent growth should still be regarded as healthy and added: \"We believe other sectors of the economy can offset the housing correction.\" The Commerce Department said new-home sales in October were at an annual rate of 728,000 units, well below Wall Street economists' forecasts for a 750,000-unit rate. The department revised down September new-home sales steeply to a 716,000-unit rate from a previously reported 770,000, further underlining the housing sector's decline. Separately, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment aid jumped by 23,000 last week to the highest since February, though the figure might have been affected by the fact that last Thursday was the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday. DAMPER ON CONSUMER SPIRITS Another report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) said U.S. housing prices posted their first quarterly drop in 13 years during the third quarter. That is likely to act as a damper on consumer spirits after years in which many homeowners felt free to tap the accumulated equity in their homes to finance spending. \"While select markets still maintain robust rates of appreciation, our newest data show price weakening in a very significant portion of the country,\" OFHEO Director James Lockhart said. Falling home prices, weakening consumer confidence and the pickup in jobless claims reinforced the view of many private-sector analysts that the economy was at risk of a more serious downturn than policy-makers wish to acknowledge. \"It looks like it could be lights out for the economy,\" said economist Chris Rupkey of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York, referring to the rise in claims. \"This is exactly what it looks like when we are going into recession.\" Economist Steven Wieting of Citigroup said that after showing surprising resilience through 2-1/2 years of housing declines, the economy now faced pressure from tightening credit conditions. As a result, \"We...think growth in the fourth quarter will be below 1 percent,\" he added. The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, in its latest Beige Book survey of national economic conditions, that growth had slowed in October and the first half of November, largely because of an \"ongoing slowdown\" in the housing sector. Kohn said on Wednesday that policy-makers had to stay \"nimble\" and to be prepared for \"flexible and pragmatic policy-making,\" words that markets took to mean the Fed was likely to lower interest rates further as a stimulant. On another down note, the International Monetary Fund said it will revise down its October estimate of 4.8 percent for world growth in 2008, given the impact of costlier oil and continued financial market turbulence. \"Some of the downside risks that we had identified (in October) have materialized,\" IMF spokesman Masood Ahmed said.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A surge in inventory-building and robust exports propelled U.S. economic growth ahead at the fastest rate in four years during the third quarter, but a jump in claims for jobless benefits last week underscored the sharp slowdown now under way. \n",
      "\n",
      " The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that gross domestic product that measures total production within U.S. borders climbed at a revised 4.9 percent annual rate instead of 3.9 percent reported a month ago. It was the strongest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2003 when GDP surged at a 7.5 percent rate and slightly exceeded Wall Street economists' forecast for a 4.8 percent rate of increase. The department revises its GDP figure twice after its initial estimate and will publish its final figure for third-quarter performance on December 20. Third-quarter GDP is now regarded as old information by Wall Street participants, who focused on the surge in jobless aid claims. A slumping housing sector and waning consumer confidence already is predicted to sap fourth-quarter growth and analysts say that risks are rising for a recession next year. The Labor Department said new claims for unemployment aid jumped by 23,000 last week to the highest since February, though that figure might have been affected by the fact that last Thursday was the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday. \"It looks like it could be lights out for the economy,\" said economist Chris Rupkey of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York, referring to the rise in claims. \"This is exactly what it looks like when we are going into recession.\" Economist Steven Wieting of Citigroup said that after showing surprising resilience through 2-1/2 years of housing declines, the economy now faced pressure from tightening credit conditions.

The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, in its latest Beige Book survey of national economic conditions, that growth had slowed in October and the first half of November, largely because of an \"ongoing slowdown\" in the housing sector. The GDP report showed companies built up inventories twice as fast during the third quarter as the government had estimated a month ago - at a $32.9-billion annual rate instead of $15.7 billion. Higher inventories add to growth and likely reflect stockpiling ahead of the Thanksgiving-to-Christmas holiday sales season but they can be a drag on future performance if sales do not meet expectations. A cheaper U.S. dollar appeared to be paying off in the form of a stronger trade performance. U.S. exports climbed at an 18.9 percent annual rate instead of 16.2 percent. It was the strongest growth in exports since the final quarter of 2003 and more than double the second quarter's 7.5 percent rate. Imports were up at a revised 4.3 percent annual rate instead of 5.2 percent, following a 2.7 percent rate of contraction in the second quarter.

      " CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Del Monte Foods Co DLM.N posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday and cut its full-year earnings forecast because of soaring costs for ingredients like wheat, corn and fish. \n",
      "\n",
      " The news sent Del Monte's stock down more than 6 percent. The maker of Del Monte canned vegetables, Meow Mix cat food and StarKist tuna said profit was $25.9 million, or 13 cents a share, in the second quarter, ended October 28, compared with $23.2 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs, earnings were 14 cents a share, falling short of the average analyst estimate of 17 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Like all food companies, Del Monte has been hit by rising commodity costs and has tried to offset those costs with price increases and cost-cutting measures. \"A lot of their brands, particularly on the consumer products side, are tied too closely to commodity prices,\" An Gilpin, an analyst at Morningstar, said. Del Monte is trying to shift to more value-added food products that can command a higher price and keep consumers from moving to lower-priced private label brands, Gilpin said. \"I think that's an evolution that is happening right now -- unfortunately, it is not happening fast enough,\" she said. One commodity hurting the company is fish. The cost of skipjack tuna was up more than 65 percent during the quarter compared with a year earlier and fish costs make up half of the operating cost in the company's seafood business, according to Del Monte. \"The higher price of skipjack is not expected to be offset,\" Richard Wolford, chairman and chief executive officer, said during a conference call with analysts. Sales rose 5 percent to $938.1 million in the second quarter. Del Monte said it now expects earnings of 64 cents to 68 cents a share for the year, down from its previous forecast of 70 cents to 74 cents a share. Del Monte shares were down 57 cents at $9.15 at midday on the New York Stock exchange. The stock is down more than 17 percent this year, compared with a 3 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's U.S. packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warner Music Group WMG.N, the world's No. 3 music company, on Thursday said profits fell 58 percent as CD sales slipped further, but shares rose as investors hoped the worst of an industry slump was priced into its stock. \n",
      "\n",
      " Warner Music shares closed up more than 8 percent, as analysts said it beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter. \"The numbers were better than people thought, they were certainly better than we thought they would be,\" said Bishop Cheen, analyst at Wachovia. \"Clearly the U.S. team is making it happen where they're out-performing the market.\" Warner's net profit was $5 million, or 3 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from a year-earlier profit of $12 million or 8 cents per share. The 2007 quarter benefited from a $12 million settlement from Bertelsmann AG over music downloading service Napster, but that was partly offset by $9 million in restructuring costs. Revenue rose 2 percent to $869 million, but declined 2 percent when taking out the impact of a weaker dollar. Warner's strong sellers included Linkin Park, James Blunt and Michael Buble. But the company also posted weaker international sales, particularly in the United Kingdom. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates were looking for revenue of $869.5 million, on average, and a net loss of 10 cents per share. Album sales in the United States fell 14 percent as of the end of last week from a year ago, according to data from Nielsen SoundScan. More fans bought individual songs through online stores such as Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) iTunes, or used free file-sharing services to get music. Digital music revenue was up 25 percent at $130 million during the quarter, but this could not make up for a shortfall in compact disc sales FASTER RATE OF CD DECLINES Warner's stock price is still down more than 66 percent since the start of the year as evidence that the decline in music sales had accelerated became more clear to investors. Like other major music companies, Warner is trying to expand ties with its artists beyond recording and publishing, to include new digital services as well as share in image rights, advertising, touring and management revenue. Chief Executive Edgar Bronfman accepted that not all of Warner's artists would agree to new relationships. \"I think you'll see us coming to agreements with a number of existing artists and I think you'll see us not coming to agreement with a number of existing artists,\" he said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. Last month, Madonna, one of the world's top-selling artists, said she would leave Warner Music to sign with concert promoter Live Nation Inc ( LYV.N ). Warner retains the rights to all of Madonna's recordings to date and her publishing rights. \"There will be some agreements that existing artists sign with others, as has been the case with Madonna, where it was in our view economically imprudent to do that deal,\" Bronfman said. On Wednesday, Warner said it formed a joint partnership with the estate of Frank Sinatra to manage all music, film and stage rights of the late singer as well as administer all licenses for the Sinatra name and likeness. Warner is now the only major record and publishing music company still publicly traded after London-based EMI Group was taken private by leveraged buyout firm Terra Firma this year. Shares in Warner Music rose 58 cents, or 8.1 percent, to close at $7.73 at close on Thursday. (Reporting by Yinka Adegoke; Editing by  Gary Hill )\n"

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks edged higher on Thursday as shares of Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) and other energy companies rose on supply concerns, offsetting worries about the economy and a pullback in bank stocks. \n",
      "\n",
      " Trading was volatile after a two-day surge as investors wrestled with conflicting economic reports, disappointing retail profit reports and news of a pipeline explosion in the U.S. Midwest. Shares of Exxon rose nearly 1 percent as an explosion at a pipeline disrupted the flow of oil from Canada to U.S. Midwest refineries. Caution before a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday evening also kept a lid on the market and some investors opted to sell some of the winners from the recent rebound, such as banks. \"This is a highly volatile market,\" said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto, Canada. \"It has suddenly shifted to big energy and financial shares are a little weaker.\" The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 22.28 points, or 0.17 percent, to 13,311.73. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 0.70 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,469.72. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 5.22 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,668.13. PLAYING DEFENSIVE Exxon was second-biggest contributor, behind Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ), to the S&P 500 and the Dow's climb, ending up 0.8 percent at $88.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) gained 1.4 percent at $78.82, while Chevron ( CVX.N ) gained 0.6 percent to $86.56. Shares of Altria, parent of cigarette maker Philip Morris, ended up 2.6 percent at $75.98 on the NYSE, after surging to an all-time high of $76.15. Companies that make consumer staples such as cigarettes, fast-food and soft drinks are seen as better investments in the face of a slowing economy. AT&T, APPLE RING UP GAINS AT&T Inc ( T.N ), the No. 1 U.S. mobile provider, also stood out, ending up 1.4 percent at $38.03. Its chief executive announced 2008 plans for a new version of Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone with high-speed wireless Web links.  Apple shares lent the biggest boost to the Nasdaq's advance, ending up 2.3 percent at $184.29. But after the bell, Dell Inc DELL.O, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, gave a cautious outlook despite reporting a higher quarterly profit, sending its stock down nearly 7 percent.  Dell shares had ended up 1.6 percent at $28.14 on the Nasdaq ahead of its results. FINANCIALS RETREAT In the regular session, financial shares headed lower after a two-day surge. Shares of American Express ( AXP.N ) were among the Dow's top drags, down 0.9 percent at $56.89. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N declined 4.9 percent to $61.69 on the New York Stock Exchange after CIBC World Markets analyst Meredith Whitney cut her price target and profit estimates.  Retailers were led lower by Sears Holdings ( SHLD.O ), which reported sharply lower earnings. Sears stock lost 10.5 percent to $104.09, while Macy's Inc ( M.N ) was down 1.7 percent at $29.30. U.S. crude for January delivery last traded up 38 cents at $91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where it ranged from $90.43 to $95.17. ECONOMY, THE FED In economic news, softer-than-expected new-home sales and a surge in new claims for jobless benefits reported on Thursday heightened fears of a steep U.S. economic slide and overshadowed a strong third-quarter performance. Trading was light on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.33 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.17 billion shares changed hands, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Even with gains on the session, declining stocks outpaced advancers by a ratio of about 6 to 5 on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq. (Editing by Leslie Adler)\n",

      "\n",
      " An explosion and fire on the pipeline three miles southeast of the Clearbrook, Minnesota, oil terminal occurred on Wednesday at approximately 3:45 p.m. CST, killing two employees and halting shipments that make up nearly a tenth of U.S. imports. All Enbridge pipelines in the vicinity -- Lines 1, 2, 3 and 4 -- were immediately shut down and isolated and Enbridge emergency crews were dispatched to the site, it said. Those lines pumped some 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the third quarter. Find additional details about the lines affected, the types of crude oil involved and refineries below: THE FOUR AFFECTED LINES: The fire broke out on line 3, which had been shut down for maintenance on Wednesday in order to investigate a small leak, Enbridge spokesman Larry Springer told Reuters. He said all four lines of the pipeline will be shut down until the fire dies down enough to allow for inspections of lines 1 and 2, which are located several hundred feet away from the source of the fire and explosion. Springer warned that larger Lines 3 and 4 were likely to remain shut for some time. Details of the four lines, according to the Enbridge Web site: LINE 1: capacity 237,000 bpd. Carries natural gas liquids and refined oil products. Needs to be investigated by company before restarted; investigations to begin once the fire burns down sufficiently. LINE 2: capacity 409,000 bpd. Carries condensates, synthetics, light and medium crudes. Needs to be investigated by company before restarted; investigations to begin once the fire burns down sufficiently. \"There is nothing from any other sources that would make us think there is any damage (to Lines 1 and 2), but as prudent operators we have to inspect them before we start them back up.\" LINE 3: capacity 447,000 bpd. Carries light, medium and heavy crudes. Will require repairs and inspection by the company and by regulatory agencies before being restarted. \"(Line 3) will be the one that take the most work, it will need repairs plus the investigations.\" LINE 4: capacity 669,000 bpd. Carries heavy crudes. \"It's not likely line 4 will start up anytime soon,\" Springer said. MINNESOTA REFINERIES THAT COULD BE AFFECTED: * Flint Hills Resources' 280,000 bpd refinery in Rosmount, Minnesota.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House cut its forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2008 on Thursday and acknowledged that troubles in the housing market had been \"more pronounced\" than expected. \n",
      "\n",
      " But even as private economists grow increasingly worried about the risk of a recession, the Bush administration said the economy was resilient and predicted the six-year expansion would stay on track. In its twice-yearly forecast, which will be incorporated in the administration's fiscal 2009 budget proposal due early next year, the White House said it now expected real gross domestic product to grow 2.7 percent in 2008, down from a June forecast for 3.1 percent growth. \"We are forecasting solid growth for 2008,\" top White House economist Edward Lazear told reporters. He added that \"2.7 percent is still a good, solid growth rate and that is especially the case given that we have been hit with a pretty significant slide in the housing market.\" In housing, the decline \"has been more pronounced than we forecast at the time that we were doing our midsession review and that's built into the forecast for next year,\" said Lazear, who is chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. The administration's forecast was still above Federal Reserve policy-makers' projection of 1.8 percent to 2.5 percent real, or inflation-adjusted, GDP growth for 2008. Private economists in the closely watched Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey have predicted sluggish growth through the first half of 2008. That survey pegged GDP growth for next year at 2.4 percent, below the White House forecast. The Blue Chip panel said the odds of a recession were about one-in-three. The administration said it thought the U.S. unemployment rate would average 4.9 percent during 2008, a few notches above the 4.7 percent forecast of the June forecast. The White House raised its 2007 real GDP forecast to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent, reflecting surprisingly strong third-quarter growth. \"While the difficulties in housing and credit markets and the effects of high energy prices will extract a penalty from growth, the U.S. economy has many strengths and I expect the expansion to continue,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in a statement. Lazear said he expected housing to hurt GDP at least through the first half of next year. Private economists have been ratcheting down their economic growth forecasts in recent months as the slumping housing market and ensuing credit crunch threaten to slow consumer and business spending. Allan Hubbard, the top White House economic adviser, said this week that U.S. recession risks had increased, although he put the chances at less than 50-50. Hubbard announced his resignation on Wednesday. The White House acknowledged that rising food and energy prices have pushed up inflation, and it now expects the consumer price index to rise 3.9 percent in 2007, rather than the 3.2 percent predicted earlier. However, the administration expects inflation to ease next year. For 2008, the report estimated an inflation rate of 2.1 percent, down from the prior forecast of 2.5 percent.

      " LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer J. Crew Group Inc JCG.N posted a surprising 21 percent rise in revenues and net profit above  Wall Street's expectations on Thursday, while a raised outlook for the full year sent shares up over 10 percent. \n",
      "\n",
      " A focus on unique fashions for a more affluent customer at J. Crew stores, catalog and online businesses kept revenue robust, the company said, during a pre-holiday quarter marked by uneven consumer spending for other American retailers. Net income in the third quarter increased to $26.8 million, or 42 cents per share, from $26 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company's tax rate was significantly lower. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 36 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose to $332.7 million, the company said, well ahead of a Wall Street consensus view of $312.7 million. Same-store sales, a key gauge of retail performance that measures sales at established stores, rose 8 percent in the quarter, while sales through the company's catalog and Web site rose by 36 percent, the company said. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.8 percent compared with 7.1 percent a year earlier. Higher-than-expected sales, together with better leverage from selling, general and administrative expenses, helped drive a 44 percent increase in operating income, while improving operating profit margins to 14.3 percent of revenues from 12 percent a year earlier. Chief Executive Millard Drexler said the company's direct- to-consumer business was seeing fewer returns, while investments in that business, such as a new email strategy to stay in touch with consumers, were paying off. \"Quality and style keeps us, I think, at the forefront,\" Drexler told analysts during a conference call. \"We don't want to be in the price business. As I look at the world today, there's some great price players out there on basics, on commodities and we move away from that. \"We have taken our business very strategically up a notch or two every season so to speak, since we have all been running the company,\" said Drexler, adding that his customers do not express \"resistance to price.\" In posting third quarter results, many apparel retailers complained of light mall traffic and consumers that stayed away from stores due to warm weather and more cautious spending amid high gas prices, a slowing housing market and residual effects from the credit crisis. As part of J Crew's focus on unique, quality design, Drexler said the company was moving away from certain lower- price fabrications, saying he would leave the strategy of using cheaper fabrics to sell trendy designs at low prices to fast- fashion retailers such as Top Shop and H&M, owned by Hennes & Mauritz AB ( HMb.ST ). \"We don't want to be in the unit velocity game, but the dollar velocity game,\" Drexler said. \"We just want to play in that niche which is style and quality and great product design.\" Looking ahead, J Crew expects earnings per share for the fiscal year of between $1.50 and $1.52, up from its earlier outlook of a range between $1.42 and $1.46. Wall Street, on average, has been expecting fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.46, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales are expected to rise in the mid-single digit range, the company said. The company's shares rose $4.20 to $44.50 after closing at $40.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Alexandria Sage; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and  Andre Grenon )\n",

      " CALGARY  (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc on Thursday said it expects to quickly restart its huge pipeline system, the day after a deadly blast in Minnesota killed two workers and briefly choked off 10 percent of oil imports to the world's top consumer. \n",
      "\n",
      " Flow rates through pipeline system, which runs from Alberta, Canada, to the central United States, reached 80 percent of capacity Thursday, the company said. The Department of Transportation said it was unlikely to force Enbridge to reduce throughput at the 1.5 million-barrel-per-day (bpd) system -- the biggest U.S. import pipeline -- as it investigates the cause of the blast. \"At this time, we wouldn't expect a restriction on this incident based on what we know so far,\" said Brian Pierzina, senior engineer and inspector for the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety. The incident occurred after four other accidents on the Enbridge system this year, but the company said it occured during routine repairs and was not the result of weakened or corroded steel. Workers were wrapping up repair work on a section of pipe on the system's Line 3 near Clearbrook, Minnesota, when the oil spilled and ignited, Enbridge vice-president Leon Zupan told reporters during a conference call. \"It was at the tail end of this repair and replacement process when we restarted Line 3 and we ended up with the release from the line through one of these fittings,\" he said. U.S. oil surged more than $4 a barrel early Thursday before easing back later as Midwest refiners scrambled to find alternate supplies on concerns about a prolonged crimp in Canadian crude flows. The Department of Energy said it was contacting refiners in the region to see if they needed oil from the emergency stockpile, but Midwestern refiners said they did not anticipate a shortfall in the near-term.  NO TERROR LINK The U.S. Homeland Security Department said there were no known links to terrorism in the fire, which was extinguished on Thursday, allowing three of the four Enbridge pipelines to be restarted. Only the 450,000 bpd line 3 remained shut and was expected to come back online in the next few days following the deadly blast. \"This is an incident that has really shaken us in that it involves the death of two outstanding employees, and our concerns right now are not with the reputation of Enbridge but with the families of the two employees who were involved,\" Chief Executive Pat Daniel said. Canada is the top supplier of U.S. imported crude, with the Enbridge line shipping around 1.1 million bpd of oil to the U.S. midcontinent region. Capacity on the pipeline is growing tight due to rising oil production in Alberta and Enbridge has been working to expand the pipeline. \"The timing is pretty bad. We are coming to the strongest demand period for crude with the approach of the Northern winter,\" said Mark Pervan, analyst at ANZ Bank.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday a resurgence in financial strains in recent weeks had dimmed the outlook for the U.S. economy, signaling an openness to lowering interest rates again. \n",
      "\n",
      " \"The outlook has ... been importantly affected over the past month by renewed turbulence in financial markets, which has partially reversed the improvement that occurred in September and October,\" he said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. \"We at the Fed will have to remain exceptionally alert and flexible.\" A copy of his remarks was made available in Washington. The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will weigh fresh information about hiring, spending and financial markets when it next meets to consider interest rates on December 11, Bernanke said. The Fed lowered benchmark rates by a cumulative three-quarters of a percentage point to 4.5 percent in September and October to buffer the economy from a prolonged housing slump and credit market turbulence. \"In making its policy decision, the committee will have to judge whether the outlook for the economy or the balance of risks has shifted materially,\" he said. \"In doing so, we will take full account of the implications for the outlook of both the incoming economic data and the ongoing developments in the financial markets.\" Bernanke's comments echoed those made on Wednesday by Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who said he had been caught off guard by how poorly financial markets have fared since the central bank last met on October 30-31. Bernanke said economic data since that meeting had been mixed, with continued weakness in home sales and construction alongside a solid labor market in October. Weekly data on unemployment insurance claims had drifted higher, but was consistent with a moderate expansion in employment, he said. Meanwhile, household spending has been soft, Bernanke said. \"I expect household income and spending to continue to grow, but the combination of higher gas prices, the weak housing market, tighter credit conditions, and declines in stock prices seem likely to create some headwinds for the consumer in the months ahead,\" he said. Bernanke said that core inflation, which strips out volatile foods and energy costs, had been moderate, but he took note of the rising price of oil and said rising costs for food and some imported goods could also put upward pressure in inflation. \"The effectiveness of monetary policy depends critically on maintaining the public's confidence that inflation will be well controlled,\" he said. \"We are accordingly monitoring inflation developments closely.\" (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; editing by Leslie Adler)\n",

      " ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Buyers spent $733 million bargain-hunting on \"Cyber Monday,\" up 21 percent from a year earlier, and some analysts expect that one-day tally to be topped as Christmas nears. \n",
      "\n",
      " The biggest online traffic winners on the Monday after Thanksgiving included retailers Amazon.com Inc, Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy Co, Internet research firm comScore Inc said on Wednesday. Cyber Monday marked the first time that a single day of online spending broke the $700 million mark, comScore said. The Monday after the four-day holiday weekend has been dubbed Cyber Monday because many consumers return to work and seek deals not found in bricks-and-mortar retailers using their employers' high-speed Internet connections. ComScore said 60 percent of the money spent online on Monday came from work computers. \"It's clear that Cyber Monday is the biggest day of the 2007 holiday shopping season so far,\" said Ken Cassar, an analyst with Nielsen Online. Nielsen data indicated 32.5 million people shopped online on Cyber Monday, up 10 percent from a year earlier and higher than the 28.8 million who shopped online on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving that kicks off the holiday season for offline retailers. Cassar and others said the Cyber Monday figures would likely be surpassed in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Though retail watchers expected online sales to spike on Cyber Monday, some say the phenomenon could be waning as retailers lure online shoppers earlier in the season. Historically, online shopping picks up as the holiday season progresses. \"(Monday,) December 17 could be the heaviest day\" of the online shopping season, based on typical trends, said Andrew Lipsman, a senior analyst with comScore. He noted that while Cyber Monday sales spiked in 2006, the day wound up as just the 12th-heaviest online spending day once the holiday season was over. \"Spending continues to build over the next couple of weeks, and it usually peaks in December,\" Lipsman said. BARGAIN HUNT Deep discounts were a factor this year. A survey by BizRate Research of 116 online retailers found that 72.2 percent planned a special promotion for Cyber Monday, up from 42.7 percent of online merchants two years ago. \"It does seem like the promotions get more aggressive each year,\" said Lipsman. But those bargains could backfire later in the holiday season as rising food and fuel prices and a troubled housing market threaten to dampen consumer spending, Cassar cautioned. ComScore said the number of Cyber Monday buyers rose 38 percent from a year ago, but average spending per buyer slipped 12 percent partly because of discounting. \"If people did shop heavily on Cyber Monday driven by promotions, are these sales that won't happen later in the season?\" Cassar said. \"There is some risk that retailers may push sales early in the season at the expense of higher-margin sales later,\" he added. Other highly trafficked sites on Cyber Monday included those belonging to Target Corp and computer maker Dell Inc, according to comScore. Sanford Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay said he expects a strong fourth quarter for retailers Amazon and eBay Inc, as more consumers seek deals online. \"We believe that large numbers of consumers are already using the Internet to find bargains, save on time and gasoline by avoiding store visits, and get better selection and choice online,\" Lindsay said in a research note on Wednesday.

      "-- Sears Holdings net plummets, sending down shares\n",

      "\n",
      " ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) reported sharply lower third-quarter profit on Thursday, sending its shares down as much as 14 percent to new lows, as sales fell at its U.S. Kmart and Sears stores and it cut prices to clear excess inventory. \n",
      "\n",
      " The retailer controlled by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert said sales and margins would probably remain under pressure for the current quarter as the softer U.S. housing market and credit concerns hurt consumer spending during the critical holiday shopping season. \"Kmart and Sears have been in a downward spiral for the last two years,\" said Britt Beemer, founder of America's Research Group, which surveys consumer behavior. \"I think you're in a major free-fall.\" Beemer said Thanksgiving weekend surveys by his group indicated that both chains have 20 percent fewer shoppers than they did three years ago. There has been \"no effort to make Kmart or Sears competitive,\" Beemer said. The company was formed in the 2005 merger of Sears, Roebuck and Kmart. Net income fell 99 percent to $2 million, or 1 cent a share, for the third quarter ended November 3 from $196 million, or $1.27 a share, a year earlier. Share count was lower in the latest period as Sears bought back 6.7 million common shares. The 2006 quarter included $64 million in gains tied to swap investments. Excluding that item, the year-ago profit was 85 cents a share. Sears Holdings, which earlier this week offered to buy specialty retailer Restoration Hardware Inc RSTO.O for about $269 million, attributed its current problems to everything from increased competition to unseasonably warm weather. But in a statement, Chief Executive Aylwin Lewis said: \"We cannot blame our results entirely on the retail and macro-economic environments.\" Sears, which has unveiled new marketing campaigns this year, has \"much on which to improve,\" he added. Revenue fell 3 percent to $11.5 billion as domestic same-store sales fell 4.2 percent at Sears, Roebuck and 5 percent at Kmart, pulling total domestic same-store sales down 4.6 percent. The company cited notable declines in apparel and lawn and garden sales, partly offset by higher sales of electronics at U.S. Sears stores. 'DEATH SPIRAL?' Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note titled \"Death Spiral?\" that there was \"nothing good\" to take from the latest earnings report. \"It should be clear to investors that if Sears continues to try to make it as a retailer, it will likely not happen,\" Balter wrote. Gross margin contracted to 27.4 percent of sales from 28.3 percent a year earlier as the Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company cut prices to sell seasonal goods. Sears competes with many other chains, including Macy's Inc ( M.N ) in clothing sales and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) and other discounters in general merchandise. In appliances, Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) and Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) have chipped away at Sears' dominant market share. Before the merger, Lampert had gained favor at Kmart for making shareholders rich by selling prime real estate. In many quarters following the 2005 merger, Sears Holdings posted hefty profit growth even as sales declined, in part due to cost-cutting. But Lampert's team has come under increased criticism this year as that earnings growth has stalled. Profit fell 40 percent in the second quarter, and same-store sales at Kmart and Sears, Roebuck have sagged for the past seven quarters. \"These (latest) quarterly results prove that a financial guy can't run a retail operation,\" Beemer said. \"You can't cut expenses and grow market share.\" Standard & Poor's Equity Research slapped a \"sell\" rating on Sears Holdings, replacing its prior \"hold\" rating. \"Given limited success of remerchandising efforts at Sears and Kmart segments, increased competition, and a projected slowdown in consumer spending, we think Sears' chances of executing a turnaround are slim,\" S&P analyst Jason Asaeda said in a statement. Sears had cash of $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $2.1 billion a year earlier. Investors watch the cash balance closely because the company gives Lampert authority to invest excess money as he sees fit. Sears proposed buying Restoration Hardware for $6.75 per share, topping a management-led buyout of $6.70 to which Restoration had agreed earlier this month. Sears shares were down $13.99, or 12 percent, to $102.35 in Nasdaq afternoon trading after earlier touching $98.25 -- their lowest level since the company began trading as Sears Holdings in March 2005. As of Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen 30 percent year-to-date. (Additional reporting by Christopher Kaufman and  Justin Grant  in New York; Editing by  Gary Hill )\n",

      " CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will act to protect the wider economy from financial turmoil but not to shelter individual investors from losses, Fed Board Governor Frederic Mishkin said on Thursday. \n",
      "\n",
      " \"The fact that people lose money is just fine with me as long as I do my job of keeping the economy on an even keel,\" Mishkin said after a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology outside Boston. \"People are supposed to lose money when they do stupid things. We actually still need to respond if there is an effect on the credit markets, because aggregate demand is going to go down,\" he said in response to a question. The U.S. central bank has lowered interest rates by 75 basis points since mid-September to 4.5 percent and investors expect them to cut by at least another quarter point at their next meeting, on December 11, amid renewed market tension. Mishkin said in his speech that the decision would be driven by what happens in the economy over the next two weeks. \"The near-term path of interest rates is highly uncertain and depends on the implications of the incoming data, which in some cases are evolving right up to the time of the (Fed's interest rate-setting) meeting,\" Mishkin said. Critics complain the Fed's rate cuts since credit markets nearly seized up in August has just bailed out rich investors, while leaving ordinary people to pay the price through higher inflation down the line. Mishkin said this was short-sighted. \"People say you should not respond at all (to market losses). Guys who've made a mistake -- kill them. But if I am killing the economy at the same time, clearly I have actually done a very bad job in terms of fulfilling the mandate.\" The Fed by law must pursue both low and stable inflation and the maximum level of sustainable growth and employment. Global financial market turmoil sparked by the collapse of the U.S. subprime market has challenged policymakers to cushion growth at a time when rising energy and food prices could pressure inflation. Fed forecasts for growth and inflation through 2010 announced last week demonstrate that policy-makers would not try to abruptly lower inflation to the rate they consider optimal, Mishkin said. \"The recent high level of overall inflation reflects rapidly rising energy prices that the Federal Reserve obviously cannot control,\" he said. \"Any attempt to bring overall inflation down too quickly would entail large losses of output and employment,\" he added.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home foreclosure filings in October edged up 2 percent from September but at 224,451 were a whopping 94 percent higher than a year earlier, real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday. \n",
      "\n",
      " The figure, a sum of default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions, was down from a 32-month peak in August however, RealtyTrac, an online market of foreclosure of properties, said in its monthly foreclosure market report. RealtyTrac said the national foreclosure rate was one filing for every 555 U.S. households in October. \"Overall foreclosure activity continues to register at a high level compared to last year but it appears to have leveled off over the past two months after hitting a high for the year in August,\" James Saccacio, chief executive officer of RealtyTrac, said in a statement. In September, home foreclosure filings fell 8 percent. Default rates in the subprime segment of the U.S. mortgage market, which caters to borrowers with poor credit histories, have jumped this year as the housing industry slowed and prices fell in many regions, particularly areas that benefited the most during the housing market's boom from 2000 to 2005. \"Default notices were down nearly 9 percent in October, indicating that some of the efforts on the part of homeowners, lenders and advocacy groups to find alternatives to foreclosure may be starting to have an impact. On the other hand, bank repossessions were up nearly 35 percent, evidence that more homeowners who enter foreclosure are losing their homes,\" Saccacio said. Nevada, once one of the hottest real estate markets and a favorite among investors, led the nation with one foreclosure filing for every 154 households, 3.6 times the national average. Its 6,618 filings were up 20 percent from September and were nearly triple those reported in October 2006. California foreclosure activity fell nearly 2 percent from the previous month, but its rate of one filing for every 258 households still ranked the second-highest in the nation. California's reported foreclosure filings totaled 50,401, more than triple the number reported in October 2006. Florida's rate of one foreclosure filing for every 273 households ranks it third-highest.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ) is getting a $2.55 billion cash infusion from investors led by Citadel Investment Group, which is also buying the mortgage-related securities portfolio that has been the primary source of the discount brokerage's recent woes. \n",
      "\n",
      " Chicago-based Citadel, which often invests in troubled assets and companies, will gain about 18 percent ownership of E*Trade and a board seat, E*Trade said on Thursday. E*Trade shares, which have lost about 80 percent since January, surged at first on news of the deal but wound up falling 46 cents, or 8.7 percent, to close at $4.82 on Nasdaq, as investors soured on a deal that didn't meet expectations. BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), the largest publicly traded U.S. asset manager, is also an investor in the Citadel bail-out, E*Trade said. Mitch Caplan, E*Trade chief executive since 2003, is stepping down, the company said. Donald Layton, a former vice chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) who has been advising the brokerage, will become E*Trade's chairman. Jarrett Lilien, now chief operating officer, will become acting chief executive. The deal includes immediate funding of about $2.4 billion and rids E*Trade of its troubled $3 billion asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio. Citadel will pay $800 million for the portfolio. Another component of the deal is the purchase of $1.75 billion worth of 10-year notes and stock that will pay an annual interest rate of about 12.5 percent, E*Trade said. E*Trade said it will take a fourth-quarter pretax charge of $2.2 billion as a result of the portfolio sale. It will also increase its allowance for bad home equity loans to $400 million and will issue common stock equal to about 20 percent of its outstanding shares. LUMP OF COAL \"Citadel is the clear winner in this transaction,\" Bank of America analyst Michael Hecht said in a research note titled \"Xmas comes early for Citadel, shareholders get lump of coal.\" Hecht said Citadel's deal gives it a $3 billion asset-backed securities book for 27 cents on the dollar and $1.75 billion of secured paper at 12.5 percent -- and 84 million shares of stock \"for nothing.\" Hecht said shareholders, in contrast, \"suffer (more than) 40 percent earnings per share dilution and 100 percent tangible equity dilution.\" After E*Trade took large losses in its mortgage segment, analysts said it would have to pursue strategic alternatives, such as the sale of some assets or a takeover by larger rivals like Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.O or TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ( AMTD.O ). E*Trade said it considered a tie-up with a peer company but the Citadel deal appeared best. Analysts were not convinced. \"Shareholders missed an opportunity for a sale of the company that would have been $10 (or more) (per) share,\" said David Trone, an analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller. He added that E*Trade was \"a no-growth story\" and cut his price target for the company from $7.50 to $6.00 a share. Option traders also reacted. \"They are liquidating some of their long call positions as the takeover speculation fades. Every call premium is down hard,\" Lefkowitz said. \"For example, both the December $7 and $6 call premiums are down more than 40 percent in value,\" said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. CEO SEARCH The company, one of the largest U.S. online bank and brokerages, said it will search for a new CEO. Acting chief Lilien, who has been with E*Trade since 1999, will be considered along with external candidates. Lilien said in an interview that he was the only candidate so far. Departing CEO Caplan will retain a seat on the board and have an advisory role, E*Trade said. E*Trade, best known for its brokerage business, in recent years diversified into mortgages, mortgage securities and other lending areas. That paid off until earlier this year, when the company was hit by large losses in its mortgage business. Lilien said the Citadel deal allows it to get its troubled portfolio off its books and provides much-needed cash. And he said the company plans to stick with its two-pronged business model, offering brokerage and banking services to customers. The board had considered about 40 different transactions, he added, declining to be more specific. \"Our belief is that our business is in great shape,\" he said. \"Our strategy we feel was on target -- it was our balance sheet that had the issues.\" E*Trade earlier this month withdrew its financial outlook for 2007. Lilien said the company did not plan to issue financial forecasts at least through the end of the year. E*Trade disclosed that retail client assets have fallen 15 percent in the month, but Lilien said it hopes to win back much of that business. As of November 27, retail client assets were $192 billion compared with $226.7 billion on October 31. The company has historically issued financial metrics on a monthly basis, but on a conference call with investors it said it will now only make quarterly disclosures.

      " CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - A deadly explosion on a Enbridge Inc. pipeline in Minnesota occurred during routine repairs and was not the result of weakened or corroded pipe, company executives said on Thursday. \n",
      "\n",
      " Workers were wrapping up repair work on a section of pipe on the system's Line 3 near Clearbrook, Minnesota, when the oil spilled and ignited, Enbridge Vice-President Leon Zupan told reporters during a conference call. Three weeks earlier, the section had sprung a \"pinhole\" leak, which led to \"a couple barrels\" squirting out, but that did not force Enbridge to shut the line down, Zupan said. Instead, crews put a temporary repair sleeve over that section to keep crude moving. On Wednesday, workers shut the line down to cut out the damaged piece of pipe and replace it with a new, pretested section, using special couplings on both sides, he said. \"It was at the tail end of this repair and replacement process when we restarted Line 3 and we ended up with the release from the line through one of these fittings,\" Zupan said. Executives said crews are still investigating the cause of the explosion and fire at the site. The blast killed two pipeline maintenance workers who lived in the Superior, Wisconsin, area. Company officials said they would not release their identities until the families gave their approval to do so. The incident was the second involving Line 3 this year. In April, the line ruptured near Glenavon, Saskatchewan, spilling 3,750 barrels. Unlike Wednesday's incident, the break did not occur during maintenance. Enbridge was forced to run the line at 80 percent of capacity into the summer. Line 3 is expected to be back in service in the next two or three days. Enbridge's other three adjacent pipelines in the area resumed service on Thursday. Executives said the Minnesota incident was not the result of inexperienced staff conducting dangerous work. \"All of the employees that were involved in this incident were fully trained and qualified to do their tasks, so it's not an issue of length of service here,\" Zupan said. Executives said they will co-operate with U.S. federal and state agencies to determine how the explosion occurred and will commit the necessary resources to make sure its system is safe. In response to a reporter's question, Chief Executive Pat Daniel said he and his company were not agonizing over whether the tragedy might damage Enbridge's reputation. \"This is an incident that has really shaken us in that it involves the death of two outstanding employees, and our concerns right now are not with the reputation of Enbridge but with the families of the two employees who were involved,\" Daniel said.

      " SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O warned on Thursday that the costs of restructuring and investment could \"adversely impact\" its performance, sending shares of the world's second-largest personal computer maker down 8 percent. \n",
      "\n",
      " While the company reported greater-than-expected quarterly revenue growth and a 27 percent rise in profit, investors zeroed in on its rising costs and the cautious outlook. Net income for its fiscal third quarter ended November 2 grew to $766 million, or 34 cents per share, from $601 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $15.65 billion from $14.42 billion, whereas analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $15.36 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Dell booked costs of $50 million, or 2 cents per share, related to job cuts and asset disposals, plus $28 million, or 1 cent per share, for a year-long accounting audit. Several analysts said its earnings were in line with expectations after factoring out one-time items, a disappointment given the strong revenue performance. \"The bottom line is that people were disappointed. People expected more than they got,\" said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates of Concord, Massachusetts. Revenue from servers used by businesses to run networks and Web sites rose 8 percent to $1.6 billion. Data-storage system revenue also rose 8 percent, to $600 million. Revenue from laptop computers rose 19 percent to $4.7 billion while desktop revenue fell 1 percent to $4.8 billion. Industrywide, global PC shipments grew 16 percent in the third quarter, helped by rising notebook sales at retailers outside the United States, researcher IDC said in October. Dell is facing increasing competition from Asian rivals including Acer Inc ( 2353.TW ) and Lenovo Group Ltd ( 0992.HK ) in the United States, which accounts for the majority of Dell's sales. The company, hoping to compete better with larger rival Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) and Asian competitors, in June began selling PCs in stores for the first time after 23 years of direct-only sales via phone or Internet. It has started selling PCs in Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) in North America and GOME Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd ( 0493.HK ) in China, and announced this week plans to sell computers in France, Spain and Belgium through France's Carrefour SA ( CARR.PA ), the world's second-largest retailer. Like rivals, Round Rock, Texas-based Dell has been helped by falling prices for computer memory and other components and by strong PC demand in U.S. back-to-school sales and pre-holiday gift spending. But Dell said restructuring costs related to ongoing job reductions, investments in the business and acquisitions \"may adversely impact the company's performance.\" Also, a slowing decline in component costs and a seasonal product-mix shift to U.S. consumer and international regions may also hurt results, Dell said. Dell shares fell 7.8 percent to $25.93 in extended trading following the earnings report, after adding 1.6 percent to close at $28.14 on Nasdaq. The stock, up 10 percent in 2007 through Wednesday, trades at 19 times estimated earnings per share for its fiscal year ending in January, compared with 17 for HP's fiscal year ended in October and IBM's ( IBM.N ) 2007 multiple of 15.

      " According to the Journal, Citadel will make a two-part investment in E*Trade in a bid to restore confidence and liquidity in the discount brokerage.

The second component is the purchase of $1.75 billion worth of 10-year notes, paying an annual interest rate of about 12.5 percent, according to the Journal. Following the regulatory approval process, Citadel is expected to own a 20 percent stake in E*Trade, including the nearly 3 percent it already owns, and gain a board seat, the Journal said. Representatives of E*Trade could not immediately be reached for comment. Analysts have previously said E*Trade will have to pursue strategic alternatives, such as a deal or sale of some assets, after large losses in its mortgage segment.

      " BERLIN  (Reuters) - Former foreign minister Joschka Fischer urged Chancellor Angela Merkel Friday to admit to Germany that ceding central bank independence and some sovereignty, and underwriting other states' debts, was the inevitable price of saving the euro. \n",
      " \"There is no way round it: the price of the stability union will be a 'transfer union' and vice-versa,\" Fischer told Reuters in an interview. German critics of bailing out over-indebted members of the euro zone such as Greece call this process a 'transfer union', whereby fiscally-disciplined countries like Germany pay for the excessive debts and deficits of their European partners. \"You can't have one without the other -- that is the price of the euro,\" said Fischer, who was a strong advocate of Europe as foreign minister from 1998-2005, when his Greens shared power with Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD). Fischer, a sharp critic of conservative leader Merkel's leadership in the sovereign debt crisis, said her government was always doing \"too little, too late. Which means the solutions to the debt crisis are getting more and more costly.\" Merkel should stop resisting calls from financial markets and foreign governments to back a stronger role for the European Central Bank and to jointly-issued euro zone bonds, the former Greens politician said. \"At the moment there is no perfect solution,\" said Fischer, who has retired from German politics and became a consultant to the Nabucco gas pipeline project in 2009. His old party and the SPD back the idea of euro bonds -- which Merkel says would just remove the incentive for states to reign in debts and spending by leveling off interest rates and could threaten the top credit rating of countries like Germany. However none of Germany's parliamentary parties currently dare to question the central tenet of an independent ECB, which Germans consider the best defense against the hyperinflation that the country suffered between the two world wars. Merkel's current focus in the euro crisis - beyond urging the implementation of decisions to boost the euro-zone bailout fund and recapitalize banks - is to seek fiscal discipline via centralized monitoring of the budgets of European states. This would require what she touts as \"limited treaty changes\" enabling countries to cede some sovereignty to the European Union's executive Commission, which would appoint a \"Budget Commissioner\" and impose sanctions on rule breakers. Fischer said what Europe needed was a massive handover of sovereignty to Brussels, in order to convince financial markets that the bloc is serious about defending the euro. \"So far in the crisis the markets have been in the driving seat, because they didn't believe politicians would face up to the consequences of having a common currency and say where they wanted to go,\" said Fischer. With an agreement among all 27 EU members unlikely, Fischer said, the 17 euro members should agree treaty changes among themselves to create \"an avant-garde, a vanguard.\" (Writing by  Stephen Brown ; Editing by Rosalind Russell)\n"

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A shopper pepper-sprayed other bargain hunters and robbers shot at customers to steal their Black Friday purchases, marring the start of the U.S. holiday shopping season, according to authorities. \n",
      " Up to 20 people were injured after a woman used pepper spray at a Walmart in Los Angeles to get an edge on her competitors. In a second incident, off-duty officers in North Carolina used pepper spray to subdue rowdy shoppers waiting for electronics. A man was in critical but stable condition after being shot by robbers in a parking lot outside a Walmart In San Leandro, California, at 1:50 a.m. (0950 GMT), Sergeant Mike Sobek said. The man was in a group of men headed for their car after shopping when robbers confronted them and a fight ensued, Sobek said. The man's shopping companions held down one of the robbers until police arrived and took him into custody. \"It doesn't look like they got away with anything. They weren't expecting these guys to fight back,\" Sobek said. In Los Angeles, authorities were reviewing security tapes to track down a woman in her 30s who pepper-sprayed a crowd at a Walmart as customers swarmed for Xboxes on sale late Thursday, Los Angeles police Sergeant J. Valle said. \"They were opening a package to try to get some Xboxes from a crate and this lady pepper-sprayed a whole bunch of people in order to gain an advantage over the Xboxes,\" Valle said. Black Friday is the busiest day of the year for U.S. stores. 'SENSELESS ACT' Off-duty police officers working as security for a Walmart in Kinston, North Carolina, used pepper spray to keep anxious shoppers at bay before the start of an electronics sale at midnight on Thursday, authorities said. The already \"rowdy\" atmosphere intensified when employees began to bring out pallets of electronic merchandise, Kinston director of public safety Bill Johnson said. When customers tried to grab merchandise from the pallets before the sale time, the off-duty officers hired as store security guards for the event discharged pepper spray to restore order, Johnson said. One man was arrested for failing to follow officers' orders, he said. \"No one was pepper sprayed in the face,\" Johnson said, adding that he was unaware of any injuries. Walmart is the U.S. discount store unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. A company spokesman, Greg Rossiter, said violence at a handful of stores marred an otherwise safe start to the holiday shopping season at thousands of Walmart stores. The San Leandro shooting \"was a senseless act of violence and our thoughts and prayers are with the customer and his family during this difficult time,\" Rossiter said. In another incident, a woman was shot in the foot by a robber who accosted her in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, early on Friday demanding her purse as she and companions put their purchases into a car trunk near a Walmart, police said. The shopper was hospitalized. Her condition was not known. A Cave Creek, Arizona, Walmart was evacuated and shopping halted temporarily Thursday night after an apparent explosive device was found in an employee break room, Maricopa County Sheriff's Department spokesman Christopher Hegstrom said. \"We sent a robot in,\" Hegstrom said, adding that the device was removed and the store was reopened after bomb squad dogs were sent through the facility. In Manhattan, a group of shoppers upset that Hollister's flagship store was not opening at midnight like other locations apparently broke into the store and stole a large quantity of clothing, police said. No arrests have been made in the burglary.

      " The unnamed individual, who lives in western Japan and owns an undisclosed number of shares, has widened the suit to include 37 executives, up from 21, and wants the company's auditors to pay damages as well, Olympus said in a statement. The shareholder is asking for 149.4 billion yen ($1.9 billion), 10 billion yen more than originally sought, from executives found to have failed to meet their fiduciary responsibilities. Under this type of shareholder representative suit, the repayment of alleged losses is to the company rather than to individual shareholders. The shareholder is asking that Olympus's 11 auditors and two auditing companies who signed off on acquisitions that were used to hide investment losses also pay damages of 149.4 billion yen. A U.S. investor, Lloyd Graham, has also filed a securities lawsuit against the Japanese camera and endoscope maker, seeking class-action status and accusing Olympus of making false statements about its finances and intentionally hiding losses from investors.

Corzine's attorneys, \"gave us every indication he was willing to testify under oath,\" said the staffer, who was not authorized to comment on the record. \"Unless he has a change of heart at the last minute, we expect him to talk and not take the fifth,\" he said, referring to the constitutional protection against self-incrimination. Corzine's attorney, Andrew Levander, was not immediately available to comment. MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31, after $6.3 billion in risky bets on European sovereign debt spooked investors and an effort to sell the firm failed. Regulators and Justice Department officials have been investigating the firm's sudden demise and seeking the whereabouts of around $1.2 billion in customer funds. The congressional staffer also confirmed that the big three credit ratings agencies have agreed to testify about their relations with the company prior to its collapse. Moody's and Fimalac SA's Fitch Ratings did not cut their investment-grade ratings of MF Global until days before it failed.

      " BUDAPEST  (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's cut Hungary's debt to \"junk\" grade late on Thursday, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's unorthodox economic policies and prompting his government to denounce the move as a \"financial attack.\" \n",
      " Moody's lowered Hungary's sovereign rating by one notch to Ba1, just below investment grade, with a negative outlook, hours after rival Standard & Poor's held fire on a flagged downgrade after Budapest said it would seek international aid. The move followed warnings from all three major ratings agencies that Orban's policies, which have eschewed traditional austerity in favor of revenue-boosting steps like a special bank tax and the nationalization of $14 billion in pension assets, had put Hungary's finances at risk. It also came after Orban relaunched aid talks this week with the International Monetary Fund, a dramatic reversal after he cut cooperation with the Fund short last year after sweeping a 2010 election on a vow to regain \"economic sovereignty.\" Moody's cited rising uncertainty about Hungary's ability to meet fiscal goals, high debt levels and what it called increasingly constrained medium-term growth prospects. \"Moody's believes that the combined impact of these factors will adversely impact the government's financial strength and erode its shock-absorption capacity,\" it said in a statement. Hungarian bond yields soared by about a full percentage point, lifting its entire bond curve above 9 percent, but yields dropped by about 20-30 basis points in afternoon trade as high yields prompted buyers to enter the market. The cost of insuring Hungarian debt against default jumped to new record highs at 635 basis points, eclipsing earlier highs hit in March 2009. The forint rebounded from morning falls of about 1.6 percent to trade at 314.10 by 1259 GMT. The Czech crown fell to a 17-month low and the Polish zloty dipped beyond the 4.50 per euro level and briefly approached a 27-month low of 4.537 hit in September. Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said that although most of central and Eastern Europe was better off than southern Europe, fears over the euro zone debt crisis and the Hungarian downgrade indicated turmoil ahead. \"There's no question that sentiment toward the region is deteriorating rapidly and that even the most resilient economies are in for a rough ride in the months ahead,\" he said. SHORT-LIVED SURPLUS The downgrade is a major setback for Orban, whose Fidesz party ousted Socialists he has blamed for economic mismanagement by winning a two-thirds majority in last year's election. He has cut taxes for families and small firms and raised tariffs on banks, utilities and other big, mainly foreign-owned, firms, putting the country of 10 million on track to run one of the European Union's only budget surpluses this year. But his policies have failed to spur growth and irked voters who resent his aggressive tactics and oppose his seizing private pension savings to fund an inefficient public sector. The government's unpredictability and rising pressure from the euro zone crisis have hammered investor sentiment. The forint has fallen 16.3 percent since July 1, versus 12.6 percent for its regional peer the Polish zloty and 6.7 percent for the Czech crown. The Economy Ministry has blamed the currency's plummet -- which has hit Hungarians who have borrowed in foreign currency -- on market speculators. It said the downgrade was unwarranted, the latest in a string of \"financial attacks against Hungary.\" \"Obviously, the forint's weakening is not justified by either the performance of the Hungarian economy, or the shape of the budget,\" the Economy Ministry said in a statement. The government cited its commitment to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent of economic output next year, 1 percent of GDP's worth of reserves in the 2012 budget, and an expected decline in debt levels, as arguments against the rating cut. But Moody's said the government's 2.5 percent of GDP budget deficit target for next year may be difficult to meet due to high funding costs and low economic growth. The weak forint pushed Hungary's government debt to 82 percent of economic output by the end of the third quarter, undoing the impact of Orban's $14 billion pension asset grab. Hungary must roll over 4.7 billion euros in external debt next year as it starts repaying part of its 20 billion euros, 2008 bailout from the IMF -- something that could be solved with a new financing deal. In his unexpected about face on potential IMF support, Orban made clear that he would not accept any demands in exchange for cash at the ready should the need arise. but Moody's said the request to resume talks illustrated Budapest's funding challenges. \"Even with such an arrangement, the government's debt structure will remain vulnerable to shocks in the medium term, which are inconsistent with a Baa3 rating,\" Moody's said. \"SAFETY NET\" The European Commission forecasts the economy will expand by only 0.5 percent at most next year, far lower than the 3 percent initially forecast in Orban's medium-term budget plan. Complicating that further is high unemployment, weak bank lending and 5 trillion forints in mostly Swiss franc denominated foreign currency mortgages which have seen repayments soar due to the franc's strength and forint's slide. Orban has introduced an option for families to repay loans at exchange rates below market levels, but that has roiled markets and inflicted billions of forints of losses on the bank sector, undermining growth and lending. Economists said the gloomy economic outlook could combine with the downgrade and increase pressure on Budapest to accept an IMF deal with the monitoring and policy recommendations Orban has spurned. \"As the economy will tumble into recession by around the turn of the year, we expect that it will have no other choice than to accept any IMF proposal, even if this would include conditionalities,\" said Michal Dybula at BNP Paribas. Moody's said it would further lower Hungary's rating if there was a significant decline in government financial strength due to a lack of progress on structural reforms and implementation of a medium-term plan. The ratings cut came just hours after S&P deferred its decision on a possible downgrade of Hungary to non-investment grade until end-February, pending IMF talks. Fitch, another rating agency which has Hungary in the lowest investment-grade category, has said an agreement on a new IMF program could reduce downward pressure on Hungary's rating.

      " (Reuters) - Exchange operator CME Group Inc ( CME.O ) fined Infinium Capital Management, a U.S. high-frequency trading firm, a total of $850,000 for three separate computer malfunctions that rattled futures markets in 2009 and 2010. \n",
      " Infinium trading programs malfunctioned on October 7 and again on October 28, 2009, causing uncontrolled selling of e-mini contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Then on February 3, 2010, the firm lost control of an algorithm that bought oil futures in rapid succession on the New York Mercantile Exchange. CME, which runs both exchanges, charged the firm on Friday for \"acts detrimental\" to the marketplace in the October incident, for improper identification in the February incident and for failing to supervise its activities in both cases. Reuters reported the oil-futures algorithm malfunction and CME investigation last year. Infinium's buying on February 3 sparked a frenzied $1 surge in oil prices late that day as the computer program sent thousands of orders per second, racking up a million-dollar loss for the firm. Infinium neither admitted not denied the rule violations, CME said in separate disciplinary notices. High-frequency firms rely on rapid-fire trades and short-term strategies to make markets and earn the spreads on fleeting price imbalances. Although these firms add much liquidity to securities, they have been criticized by some for destabilizing markets and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is considering new rules that could rein them in. Infinium, run by Chief Executive Charles Whitman, is a household name in Chicago's trading community and a member of the Futures Industry Association's Principal Traders Group, a lobby group for high-frequency traders. CME found that Infinium errantly sold 6,958 December-dated e-mini Nasdaq 100 Index futures over seven seconds early on October 28. The firm later contacted the exchange about the problem, resulting in price changes in 763 contracts. A similar malfunction with the same so-called automated trading system happened on October 7, although Infinium \"took no further action to correct, modify, or disable\" it before October 28, CME said. Those two incidents resulted in a $500,000 fine. The malfunction on the NYMEX - which involved the trading of an exchange-traded fund called United States Oil Fund and the U.S. crude benchmark future, West Texas Intermediate - resulted in a $350,000 fine. CME said that, in that instance, Infinium used an algorithm in the open market that had been created the previous night with only one to two hours of back-testing. Greg Eickbush, Infinium's chief operating officer, said it was likely the largest fine handed down for a nonfraudulent human error in this market. \"I think that just represents the times and the current environment more than anything else,\" he said of the sharp scrutiny of high-frequency trading. \"We didn't want to be on the precedent-setting end of any fines, however we do understand the importance of keeping the marketplace as transparent and as trustworthy as possible,\" Eickbush added. \"We haven't had a problem since, nor do we see any problems in the future.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; editing by  Tim Dobbyn  and  Andre Grenon )\n",

      " MILAN  (Reuters) - Italy paid a record 6.5 percent to borrow money over six months on Friday and its longer-term funding costs soared far above levels seen as sustainable for public finances, raising the pressure on Rome's new emergency government. \n",
      " The auction yield on the six-month paper almost doubled compared to a month earlier, capping a week in which a German bond auction came close to failing and the leaders of Germany, France and Italy failed to make progress on crisis resolution measures. Though Italy managed to raise the full planned amount of 10 billion euros, weakening demand and the highest borrowing costs since it joined the euro frightened investors, pushing Italian stocks lower and bond yields to record highs on the secondary market. Yields on two-year BTP bonds soared to more than 8 percent in response, a euro lifetime high, despite reported purchases by the European Central Bank. In a sign of intense market stress, it now costs more to borrow for two years than 10 on the secondary market and borrowing costs for whatever term are above the 7 percent threshold, over which Italy is likely to need outside help if they do not subside. \"The pricing is awful,\" said Padhraic Garvey, rate strategist with Dutch bank ING in Amsterdam. \"The object of the exercise this morning was to get the job done and they've done that, but that's about the only positive thing to say.\" Investors' attention will now turn to a bond sale of up to 8 billion euros that Italy is planning for next Tuesday. \"For the BTP auctions next week, we'll have more of the same they'll probably get it done at a concession,\" Garvey said. Italy's new technocrat government, which took power last week, is at work on structural reforms to revive the stagnant economy but markets are looking for quick and effective responses from European policymakers, such as a greater involvement of the European Central Bank. Traders said the ECB was buying Italian and Spanish bonds in an attempt to shore the market up. But given its reluctance to prop up high-debt euro zone governments, its bond-buying program has been conducted intermittently, and never powerfully enough to provide more than short-term stability. New Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said short-term measures to tame Italy's budget deficit would not be enough to solve the country's economic problems and only structural reforms will generate growth. At an annual average rate of just 0.3 percent over the past decade, the Italian economy has grown faster than only a handful of other countries across the world. Real purchasing power has fallen 4 percent in 10 years. BIG SPRING DEBT BILLS Since being thrust to the fore of the euro zone crisis in July, Italy has always managed to attract sufficient demand at its auctions. But record high yields threaten Rome's planned gross issuance of 440 billion euros for 2012 as interest payments on the country's 1.9 trillion euro debt pile rise. Analysts say that, at current yield levels, the euro zone third-largest economy risks losing market access as redemptions totaling a massive 150 billion euros for the February-April period approach. The euro, already trading around a seven-week low, inched down after Friday's auction. European stock markets remained in negative territory for the day with the Milan stock-market the worst performer. The six-month yield nearly doubled from an auction level of 3.5 percent a month ago. By comparison, Spain paid 5.2 percent to sell six-month paper at a much smaller short-term auction earlier this week, after elections handed power to an austerity-committed conservative government. Italy also sold 2 billion euros of zero-coupon CTZ bonds at a euro era record high yield of 7.8 percent, up from 4.6 percent at the previous sale.

      " ROME  (Reuters) - European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn gave his backing to Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's new government on Friday but warned that swift action was needed to contain the escalating euro zone debt crisis. \n",
      " He dismissed fears that the euro's survival was in question but said the crisis had reached the heart of the single currency. \"This contagion effect has been touching the proximity of the core and even touching the core itself,\" he told a news conference after meeting Monti in Rome. \"It shows that this is an increasingly systemic phenomenon, which calls for strong financial firewalls in order to contain this contagion and have a counterforce to this market turbulence.\" With bond markets across the euro zone now under severe stress, markets have been looking increasingly to European leaders for a more general solution to the crisis, with many Italian politicians joining calls for jointly issued euro bonds. However Rehn said the idea faced considerable skepticism in Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, where many voters fear they will be forced to subsidize what are widely seen as fiscally irresponsible southern states. \"If I put it nicely, I would say there is a variety of views and there is quite some opposition as regards (common) euro bonds,\" Rehn said in testimony held in Italy's Chamber of Deputies. \"It will take quite some effort before the German public and the public in some other member states will be convinced of the merits of euro bonds.\" Rehn said it was clear from his talks with governments in Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and other states that euro bonds could only be adopted at the end of a process of much deeper economic union. \"The necessary pre-condition for any serious move (on euro zone bonds) is further reinforcement of economic government toward a fiscal union,\" he said. However, he underlined the need for a \"community method\" in building this fiscal union, rather than \"directorates of two countries or more,\" and stressed that Germany would have to co-operate with its partners. \"As Mrs Merkel wants to decide a fiscal union, the German government will have the pleasure to negotiate with the other 26 members of the EU and the other 16 members of the euro zone, as well as the Commission ... when decisions of fiscal union and economic union are taken,\" he said. The debt crisis now ravaging the euro zone shows the error of launching Europe's economic and monetary union without a solid economic foundation, Rehn said.

      " BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgium's political deadlock sparked a downgrade in its debt on Friday, possibly forcing the country to pay higher interest rates as it nears 18 months without a formal government. \n",
      " Standard & Poor's downgraded Belgium's credit rating to double-A from double-A-plus, citing concerns about funding and market pressures, as the euro zone debt crisis continues to worsen. \"We need a reply that is clear and credible if we are to avoid the worst,\" Belgium's caretaker prime minister, Yves Leterme, told Belgian television immediately after S&P's announcement. The downgrade followed difficulties this week in Belgium's drawn-out attempt to form a government. Elio Di Rupo, leader of the French-speaking Socialists, had been trying to form a government based on a six-party coalition. But he tendered his resignation on Monday after talks for a 2012 budget - agreement on which is a condition for forming a government - ground to a halt. \"The announcement by Standard & Poor's reinforces further the necessity to finalize the 2012 budget in a very brief period,\" Finance Minister Didier Reynders said in a statement. Economists said that the downgrade might force the political parties to forge an agreement over the weekend, but that this would still be too late for the country to avoid higher borrowing costs. \"Even if they have an agreement tonight we will have to pay higher interest rates due to the lower rating,\" said Philippe Ledent, an economist at Bank Degroof. In its statement, S&P said: \"We think the Belgian government's capacity to prevent an increase in general government debt, which we consider to be already at high levels, is being constrained by rapid private sector deleveraging both in Belgium and among many of Belgium's key trading partners.\" Barclays Capital economist Francois Cabau pointed out that Belgium had been on a negative outlook for a year, so the announcement was not big news. \"I guess they saw enough in terms of the political uncertainty,\" he said. Reynders said that Belgium's credit rating was still one of the most solid in Europe, and that its heavy debt burden was already heading downwards. Though Belgium's outstanding debt is nearly as big as its gross domestic product, making it one of the most indebted countries in Europe, the country's budget deficit is forecast to be relatively low this year at 3.6 percent. The six parties involved in the budget talks are aiming at a budget deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP for next year, but have failed to agree how much of the savings should come from higher taxes and how much from public spending cuts. The budget wrangling and a wider loss of confidence in European sovereign debt have pushed up Belgium's borrowing costs sharply. At the end of September, the yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds was under 3.9 percent. On Friday, it was up to 5.9 percent. Belgium's downgrade followed another rough week in European sovereign debt markets. Italy paid a record 6.5 percent to borrow money over six months on Friday, raising the pressure on Rome's new emergency government. The S&P announcement is a sign of \"further deterioration across the euro zone,\" said Mark Luschini, chief market strategist in Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \"The threat is creeping closer to the core member. It's evident that their situation is untenable.\" (Reporting By Sebastian Moffett. Additional reporting by  Alexandria Sage  in Paris and  Richard Leong  in New York.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Fund managers keen to cash in on the cult of celebrity are being warned high-profile, pricey marketing campaigns in today's tough economic times could lose them more business than they win. \n",
      " Soccer manager Jose Mourinho recently joined the roster of Hollywood stars and sporting legends hired by banks and insurers to promote their brands, signing up last month to represent funds firm Henderson Group. Against the backdrop of industry job cuts, sluggish business and flatlining fund fees however, this kind of spending may backfire, say financial advisors and corporate governance groups. \"The use of celebrities can be damaging as well as helpful especially as the link between celebrity and company can be tenuous to say the least,\" said Tom Biggar, investment manager at TQInvest. \"It may become a hindrance as clients express interest in products that are completely inappropriate for them.\" Henderson's campaign is designed to project unity and strength after two recent buyouts. But spending vast sums on marketing that may be more geared to boosting internal morale than luring new clients could alienate cost-conscious investors expecting to see far more bang for their buck. Henderson recently reported retail investors, spooked by the Euro crisis, withdrew 692 million pounds more from their funds than they put in during the three months to September 30. \"You can understand why Henderson would like the public to equate the firm with Mourinho - 'the special one' - and his endorsement may be quite compelling if Mourinho limits the number of companies he pitches,\" Simon Wong, a partner in active investment firm Governance for Owners said. \"Whether the Mourinho deal is justifiable depends on, among other things, the amount paid to him and the expected payback measured in terms of increased name recognition of the firm, reputational impact and success in growing revenues from the targeted segments,\" he said. Mourinho signed up as the new face of Braun's Series 7 electric razors in September and has also fronted financial sector campaigns for American Express and more recently Portugal's Millennium Bank, in which he urged fellow countrymen to be proud of their country despite its economic difficulties. Richard Wilson, Henderson sales & marketing director, said his company was delighted with its \"excellent value\" arrangement with the Real Madrid coach but conceded it would be tough to pinpoint how much new cash he could help Henderson bring in. \"It's clear Henderson has been through a period of change and is now rallying around the idea of having a common objective,\" Wilson said. Pete Davis, founder of Getmemedia.com, a search service for marketing ideas, who in the past managed sponsorships at Swiss foods group Nestle, estimates endorsement by a well known personality could be worth about 1-2 million pounds to the individual. By comparison, sponsorship of a Formula 1 racing team could cost around 25 million pounds. British insurer Aviva ruffled feathers among its investors with its 10 million pound celebrity-backed rebranding of unit Norwich Union in 2009, at a time when the reputation of financial services firms was languishing in the doldrums. Some shareholders used the forum of that year's annual general meeting to accuse Aviva of overspending on the campaign, which featured actor Bruce Willis and supermodel Elle Macpherson, but Chief Marketing Officer Amanda Mackenzie said time has underlined just how effective the tactic was. \"Our television advertisements, featuring famous people who had all changed their names, showed how this had helped them achieve a change in fame and fortune. Using celebrities is a proven way of gaining high impact fast, so you ultimately spend less on media buying,\" Mackenzie said. \"Media costs were also lower at the time we rebranded due to the economic downturn and we benefited from billboard advertising staying up beyond the period we'd paid for.\" Davis suggested the financial crisis may have driven the cost of celebrity endorsement for fund managers and banks higher because of caution on the part of the stars about being associated with institutions seen by the public as villains. \"Quite often now... celebrities will turn things down because they don't think the fit is right or they don't think the brand is moral enough. They don't necessarily need the money at the top level, so they can pick and choose,\" said Getmemedia.com's Davis. Although the campaigns are likely to generate a spike in interest in financial services firms in the short term, advisors said they seldom lead directly to a product sale, particularly with so many other factors influencing fund selection. \"I can honestly say that this should have absolutely no impact upon an advisor's decision when recommending suitable investments to clients, and any suggestion otherwise is incorrect,\" TQInvest's Biggar said.

      " MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's move to open its supermarket sector to foreign investors brought relief to its capital-starved local chains but failed to impress small-shop owners who dominate retail in the country, despite rules intended to safeguard small operators. \n",
      " New Delhi approved its biggest reform in years by allowing global supermarket giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Tesco to enter India with a 51 percent stake in the hope it would attract capital to build much-needed supply chains and improve efficiency to alleviate food-driven inflation. \"This is an extremely important step for domestic retailers as this will get in much-needed capital, apart from domain knowledge,\" said Thomas Varghese, chief executive of Aditya Birla Retail. Chain stores account for just 6 percent of a $500 billion retail market dominated by street stalls and corner shops. Many Indian chains are cash-strapped and loss-making, struggling to build scale given high costs, poor supply chains and scarce real estate and have been eyeing equity investments and joint venture partnerships with global firms to build scale. Vijay Karwal, head of consumer, retail and healthcare for Asia at Royal Bank of Scotland based in Hong Kong expects more than $5 billion in foreign investment into the Indian retail sector over the next five to seven years. Given the relative lack of modern retail infrastructure in India, and particularly in the enabling back-end infrastructure ... the vast majority of investment this change is expected to trigger would be greenfield investment into new retail sites and infrastructure,\" he said. Shares in Indian retailers Pantaloon Retail, Shoppers Stop, Trent jumped -- bucking a fall in the wider stock market -- on expectations that they will form tie-ups with foreign players, and not just compete with them. Debashish Mukherjee, partner and vice-president at consultancy firm AT Kearney, expects joint ventures and investments in local players from overseas operators over the next six months. \"The set of transactions which will happen fast is foreign players who are in existing joint ventures with Indian firms, the increase or decrease in stake, will happen quickly,\" he said. \"The second are a set of deals that are waiting to happen and have been just waiting for the announcement.\" SMALL SHOPS UNHAPPY To appease opponents, the government said foreign stores will only be permitted in cities of more than 1 million -- of which India has more than 50 -- and individual states can decide whether to allow global players on to their patch. It also insists that foreign retailers source almost a third of their produce from small industries, invest at least $100 million in India and spend half of that on infrastructure such as cold storage and warehouses. Many small shop owners fear for their livelihoods. \"It will affect my business as families prefer going to air-conditioned stores with fancy packaged goods these days,\" said Vinod Jain, a 27-year-old small grocery shop owner in the Lower Parel neighborhood of central Mumbai. A trade group representing so-called \"kirana\" shop owners is planning protests. \"The move to let the foreign retailers in will most certainly lead to job losses,\" said Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders. \"They should have worked on some kind of protectionist mechanism for smaller traders before coming out with this policy,\" he said. Foreign retailers who welcomed the Indian government's move to open the sector also view the entry conditions with caution. \"Some of the conditions look quite stringent. The investment in particular -- it's all quite big money. We'd need to know the details, and how that would be accounted for,\" said an official with a major global retailer who did not wish to be identified.

      " Banks are curtailing lending to shore up their balance sheets in the face of more stringent capital requirements and caution in the markets means the pool of capital for buying company bonds will be smaller. Companies needing to refinance their borrowing over the next year will be caught between the loan market 'rock' and the bond market 'hard place', driving up the cost of borrowing, and putting another damper on corporate investment and, by implication, economic growth. What is certain, is that companies will be leaning on the bond markets more as syndicated loans dry up. \"Our policy is to have a fifty/fifty balance of bank loans to bonds, but in the current environment we have a bias toward bonds,\" said Jean Chausse, group treasurer of French retailer Auchan, which this week launched a 3 pct, 600 million euro, five-year bond with a coupon 0.4 pct higher than where its existing bonds were being quoted. One bank active in the loans market said average fully used loan pricing for single A-rated companies has risen by 50 percent from around 80bp to 120bp over money market benchmarks. That 120bp is still well below where most banks are funding themselves in the wholesale market, highlighting the pressure banks are under to curtail loss-making loans. \"It is clear that a number of loan market participants are acting in a more selective fashion,\" said Mark Lewellen, head of European corporate origination at Barclays Capital. Many banks have announced programs for shrinking risk-weighted assets. \"In investment grade, there will be an inexorable shift in corporates accessing the bond market,\" said Michael Grayer, managing director at Lazard, adding that some had yet to fully factor in the impact of bank balance sheet deleveraging on their own funding costs and strategies. Lazard estimates that there are almost $600 bln of investment-grade corporate loans maturing in 2012 and 2013, and around $150 bln and $220 bln of corporate bonds maturing in 2012 and 2013 respectively. \"At the moment it is paramount for corporate treasurers to be wholly focused on which is the most efficient way to satisfy funding requirements,\" the group treasurer of a major bluechip company said. \"It is important to be flexible with regard to the cocktail of funding options available and take where you can -- in this case it will increasingly be bonds,\" he added. EXPENSIVE NEW BANK CAPITAL RULES As part of the euro zone's bid to stem contagion and halt the threatening crisis, banks will have to reach minimum core tier 1 capital ratios of 9 pct as early as end-June 2012, based on the systemic risk they would pose to the economy if they failed. \"At every occasion of renewal or extension we will not commit because we are deleveraging, because of the cost to balance sheet capital and funding costs,\" said one senior official at a major European bank. Depending on the size, type and exposure of the bank, requirements differ, but almost all are deleveraging by selling assets and scaling down commitments to existing loans or refusing to lend at all. Loan pricing is rising and likely to continue to do so next year, and while banks have previously lent cheaply to top companies because of extra business that can come their way, they are increasingly unwilling to continue. A study published by Standard and Poor's in September estimated that loan funding costs for euro zone corporates will likely balloon by 30-50 billion euros per year once the new banking regulations are fully implemented by 2018. Incremental borrowing costs resulting from the increased capital requirements and liquidity charge could be between 50bp and 70bp for investment-grade credits and between 92bp and 164bp for high-yield borrowers, the rating agency said. FRENCH FLIGHT SPREADS French companies were among the first to swing to bond funding this summer as their domestic banks got caught up in the euro zone crisis. Bankers are confident the trend will continue, and say it has already started spreading to other countries. \"We've seen the wave of French corporate issuance. Now other treasurers have woken up to the possibility that credit could be unavailable,\" said Christopher Marks, global head of debt capital markets at BNP Paribas. Marks said that corporates' traditional strategy of drawing on bank credit lines when bond markets were effectively closed or very expensive is over. \"That dynamic has come to an end.\" But the euro-denominated corporate market has already taken a beating in recent months, along with everything else, and investors are demanding additional new issue premiums. \"Investors are asking what is my risk-free asset or my limited-risk asset? It is not government bonds, therefore it cannot logically be a spread product benchmarked off government bonds, e.g. corporates,\" said Zia Huque, head of syndicate at Deutsche Bank. Despite the volatility he said he was encouraging corporate clients to refinance now if they needed to, rather than wait.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel may be forced to abandon the biggest advantage it has over its rivals - unlimited data services for a flat fee - because of heavy data users and a shortage of wireless airwaves. \n",
      " Moreover, the increasing likelihood that AT&T's plan to buy T-Mobile USA, the nation's fourth-largest mobile operator, will fail may have the paradoxical result of making Sprint's position even more untenable, according to analysts who follow all three companies. Sprint, the nation's third-largest mobile service provider, is planning to upgrade its network with the latest mobile standard, Long Term Evolution. But it is launching that service with only half the wireless airwaves bigger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc have assigned, leading experts to suggest that the popularity of Sprint's unlimited data plan could put a strain on the network or slow down Web surfing speeds. Sprint has assigned just 10 megahertz of spectrum for the launch compared with its rivals' 20 megahertz, analysts say. It will have to reassign airwaves being used for other services in order to expand its capacity for LTE. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, which cap data use to stem overcapacity issues brought on by heavy users, Sprint is the only big U.S. carrier still selling unlimited data for a flat fee to users of smartphones, including the Apple Inc iPhone, on its current network. \"It's a very bare-bones implementation of LTE,\" said Tolaga Research analyst Phil Marshall. \"The risk is, if you don't have headroom as your LTE subscriber base grows, then the speeds will go down.\" In that situation, Marshall does not see Sprint being able to continue to offer unlimited services. \"Unlimited is going to kill them,\" he said. \"I think they're going to have to back off from the all-you-can-eat plan.\" Unlimited data is a strong selling point for Sprint, which has been struggling for years to retain customers. For Sprint to keep the marketing advantage it has over rivals, one option could be for it to institute usage caps that are considerably higher than those of its competitors. \"That's a lever they can play if they run into being constrained,\" said an industry source who asked not to be named due to a lack of authorization to speak publicly. \"It's inevitable that they will eventually have to put caps (on their data use).\" SPRINT: NO HEADACHE Sprint, which is spending $7 billion to upgrade its network to LTE by the end of 2013, says concerns about its capacity are overblown, arguing that advanced technology allows it to make the most of its spectrum resources. Bob Azzi, a Sprint executive in charge of the company's network, said the company's plans assume that it will keep its unlimited data service during the LTE rollout. \"I don't consider it a headache,\" he told Reuters, \"We have a good understanding of the nature of those plans and what they do.\" Azzi added that the section of the 1,900 megahertz spectrum band Sprint has set aside for LTE is currently unused. He also plans to reallocate spectrum in its 800 megahertz band to use for the high-speed service by early 2014, provided it can secure regulatory approval to do so. That spectrum is currently being used by the aging iDen service Sprint hopes to shut down in mid-2013. Sprint is also in talks with Clearwire Corp, its majority-owned venture, about expanding their partnership to cover LTE. Sprint currently depends on Clearwire's network for its fastest service based on WiMax technology, and the latest talks are aimed at allowing it to piggyback on Clearwire's LTE to help it boost capacity in the \"hottest of hotspots\" by 2014 when Azzi says Sprint will need more capacity. But the future of Sprint's tempestuous relationship with Clearwire is murky since it is not yet certain if Clearwire will raise the roughly $1 billion in new funding it needs to upgrade its network to LTE. Clearwire lost one-third of its value after Sprint said on October 7 that a bankruptcy filing by the company could be \"constructive.\" Clearwire shareholders again fled on November 18 after the company said it may skip a debt interest payment due December 1. Many analysts saw that pronouncement as a negotiating tactic to try to force Sprint's hand into an agreement with favorable terms for Clearwire. SOAP OPERA One investment manager described the Clearwire/Sprint relationship as a \"soap opera\" that will end with an agreement because they are both heavily dependent on each other. \"In the short term Sprint doesn't need them beyond (WiMax) but they do need them later,\" said the manager, who asked not to be named. Even if Sprint and Clearwire reach an agreement, however, Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett is skeptical about how much it would help because of the frequency Clearwire's spectrum is on, which he said causes signal problems within buildings. \"Now that the person next to you at the conference table is surfing away on Verizon ... the shortcomings of Clearwire become painfully apparent,\" Moffett said. Moffett also noted that even if Clearwire upgrades its network, it will still have coverage for only about one-third of the U.S. population because it would need to raise a lot more funding than it is currently seeking to extend its network into new markets. Since Sprint has already had to tap capital markets for $4 billion in debt and needs up to $3 billion more in funding for its own network upgrade, analysts are skeptical it can come up with the money to help Clearwire expand further. \"What are you going to do with the (rest) of the United States? You can't just limp around on one leg,\" said Moffett, who has a \"hold\" rating on Sprint due to the uncertainty around its strategy. The uncertainty around AT&T's deal for T-Mobile USA is another big wrinkle in the Sprint story. On Thursday, AT&T withdrew its application for deal approval with the Federal Communications Commission, saying that it would focus on its legal battle with the Department of Justice. If that deal is approved, it leaves Sprint as a distant No. 4. But if it is blocked, as many analysts now expect, T-Mobile USA may look for another partner, according to the investment manager. Instead of forging a deal with Clearwire or Sprint, Moffett suggested that T-Mobile USA would instead turn to U.S. cable operators such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. Some investors had hoped these companies would come to Sprint's aid as they are part-owners in Clearwire. But since the cable operators have unused spectrum in the same band as T-Mobile USA, Moffett suggested that the cable providers would instead create a partnership with that company if it has to abandon the AT&T deal. Sprint has loudly opposed the AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal, a position that Moffett said was against its best interests. \"Now Sprint loses its logical partners in the cable operators,\" said Moffett, who described a potential cable/T-Mobile deal as a \"match made in heaven.\" Moreover, some analysts said that the $6 billion breakup package AT&T will have to pay T-Mobile if the deal fails would make T-Mobile into a more formidable rival to Sprint in the market for cost-conscious mobile consumers. The uncertainty means that Sprint does not \"know exactly how desperate they are at any given point in time,\" said the investment manager, noting that Sprint's $2.38 share price speaks volumes about investor confidence in the operator's strategy. \"It shows there's not a whole lot of faith out there that they'll be able to successfully execute on these things,' this person said.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell for a seventh straight session on Friday, leading global equity markets to their worst week in two months on fear that Europe's debt crisis is dragging on without a credible solution. \n",
      " The euro hit a seven-week low against the dollar and looked set to weaken further as Italy's borrowing costs spiraled and Belgium's credit rating was downgraded. The dollar also climbed to a near eight-month high against the Swiss franc.> On Wall Street, stocks traded higher for most of an abbreviated session on hopes that \"Black Friday,\" the traditional start of the U.S. holiday shopping season, would support major retailers. But negative headlines out of Europe forced the market to concede gains just before the close. Fewer participants in U.S. markets after Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday also made it difficult to counter the move lower. Stocks in Europe and other major exchanges also suffered their worst week in two months, although European shares ended the day up following Wall Street's initial bounce. \"Trading remains cautious (since) the poor auction of German bonds mid-week raised concerns the debt crisis is spreading to Europe's core,\" said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederick Ruffy. Investors' worries intensified after reports that Greece was demanding harsh conditions from creditors on a proposed bond swap -- critical to reduce its debt and save the euro. Banks represented by the Institute of International Finance agreed last month to write off the notional value of their Greek bondholdings by 50 percent to reduce Greece's debt ratio to 120 percent of its gross domestic product by 2020. But Greece was demanding that its new bonds' net present value -- a measure of the current worth of future cash flows -- be cut to 25 percent, a far harsher measure than a number in the high 40s that banks had in mind, according to people briefed on the matter. Greece aside, Belgium also made it to investors' watch-list after Standard & Poors downgraded the country's credit rating to AA from AA-plus, citing concerns about funding and market pressures. A European Union conference in Strasbourg produced little to soothe the markets' fears. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, after talks with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti on Thursday, agreed only to stop bickering in public over whether the European Central Bank should do more to resolve the crisis. \"The markets are going to continue to pressure the EU until they come up with a solution that is going to ease the crisis,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ AAA euro zone bond spreads:  link.reuters.com/xaw94s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> After a shortened session, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  finished down 25.77 points, or 0.23 percent, at 11,231.78. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 3.12 points, or 0.27 percent, at 1,158.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 18.57 points, or 0.75 percent, at 2,441.51 For the week, the S&P was down 4.7 percent. \"I wouldn't be surprised if the S&P tested the 1,150 level next week when traders get back to their desks,\" said Kevin Kruzenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets in Cleveland. The S&P last tested those levels on October 6. U.S. Treasuries prices also ended down as investors saw a late-day rally from Wednesday pushing U.S. yields too low amid speculation the ECB may intervene in an effort to stem contagion in the troubled euro zone. <US/> The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 23/32 in price, its yield at 1.96 percent versus Wednesday's close of 1.88 percent Commodities also fell broadly, except for U.S. crude oil, which rose on the early strength in equities and stayed up even after stocks fell. <COM/WRAP> <O/R>. European stocks ended higher after falling in six previous sessions. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European was up 0.94 percent on the day but ended the week 4.6 percent lower. Italian two-year government bond yields rose above 8 percent while the interest rate premium investors charge Italy to borrow over 10 years compared with equivalent German debt continued to rise despite reported buying by the European Central Bank. German Bund futures also extended losses, reinforcing fears that debt contagion is starting to hurt the region's soundest economy. Bund futures hit a session low of 134.27, continuing to fall after a sharp sell-off in the wake of a weak 10-year bond auction on Wednesday. World stocks, indicated by the MSCI All-World index .MIWD00000PUS were down half a percent on the day and down 5.3 percent on the week.

      " HONG KONG  (Reuters) - KPMG'S chairman on Friday called for a global set of standards for the auditing industry and said the Olympus Corp scandal in Japan reveals evidence of \"significant fraud.\" \n",
      " Michael Andrew, the chairman, also outlined steps needed to improve the auditing industry in a in a speech entitled, \"Fraud, Financial Crises and the Future of the Big Four.\" He spoke to the Foreign Correspondents Club in Hong Kong. KPMG AZSA LLC audited Olympus for several years until 2009, when it was replaced by Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC. An internal document obtained by Reuters showed that the maker of cameras and medical equipment replaced KPMG after a dispute over how to account for some acquisitions. Andrew said he was constrained in what he could say about the Olympus scandal, although he did address the issue, saying that KPMG had done the right thing in the actions it took pertaining to the Japanese company. \"What is pretty evident to me is that it is a very, very significant fraud,\" he said, adding: \"We should wait for the Japanese authorities to disclose that. \"I think it is very hard to jump to the conclusion that it's a corporate governance failure,\" he said. \"Regulation will never prevent corporate scandals,\" he added, saying that the amount of actual corporate frauds found globally is relatively \"tiny.\" Andrew also called for more coordinated regulatory oversight as auditing firms have found themselves caught between regulators wanting different rules and standards, such as the current issue facing the United States and China. He spoke of the difficulties in Europe, where accounting for Greek debt was not done according to a single set of standards by the parties involved. Andrew cited the case of France and Germany accounting for bonds using different figures. \"So how do you account for Greek debt?\" he asked, pointing out that the accounting standards should be the same. As for how that impacts the banks involved, that's up to regulators to determine, he said. CHINA-U.S. STANDOFF The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the U.S. auditor watchdog, has been pushing to be allowed to inspect Chinese audit firms, but talks with authorities in Beijing appear to have stalled in recent months. In October, audit industry sources told Reuters that China's financial authorities had asked the big audit firms to review their work on U.S.-listed Chinese companies and disclose any information they may have shared with overseas regulators. Andrew said that while this does not often happen, being caught between regulators in the United States and China in this instance makes auditing very difficult. He cited the need for global regulatory oversight to help avoid such cases. China has been one of the fastest-growing markets in the world for accounting firms, expanding by nearly 20 percent in 2010 and accounting for an estimated $1.5 billion in revenue for the Big Four firms last year, according to data from the International Accounting Bulletin. KPMG has 10,000 people in China, he said. The issues the auditing industry has faced with Chinese clients lately is not crimping the firm's growth plans there, he said. One issue being mentioned as a way to help corporate governance is audit rotation, where companies are forced to switch auditors after a certain period of time. Andrew was critical of this idea, saying that this raises cost concerns and that mistakes can go undetected during an audit handover. \"The empirical evidence shows that errors occur on that change,\" he said. Among the items he listed to improve the industry was allowing firms to expand the scope of their audits and mandatory cooperation between auditors and regulators.

      " RIO DE JANEIRO  (Reuters) - Chevron ( CVX.N ) said on Friday it planned to invest $3 billion in Brazil over the next three years, despite uproar in the South American country after an oil spill this month caused by its offshore drilling. \n",
      " Chevron was ordered to halt its drilling in Brazil this week pending investigations by the Federal Police and other authorities, after an estimated 2,400 barrels of oil leaked from its Frade field off Rio de Janeiro's coast. Chevron's Head of Latin America and Africa operations, Ali Moshiri, said planned investments were on top of $2.1 billion the oil giant has already invested in Brazil since 1997. He said Chevron was looking out for profitable oil concessions. \"We plan to continue participating in new auctions for oil exploration blocks in Brazil, if there is creation of value and benefits,\" Moshiri said in a press conference in Rio de Janeiro. Talk of expansion comes after the second-largest U.S. oil firm was fined $28 million by Brazil's environmental agency for the spill, an amount likely to rise when the energy regulator and Rio's state government fines as they have promised to do. Auctions for oil concessions in Brazil are now suspended as the country draws up new policies for the sector that is on the verge of rapid expansion after the discovery of massive 'subsalt' offshore reserves deep under a layer of salt rock. Moshiri said the planned investment was mainly for the $5.2 billion Papa-Terra project. It has a minority stake with the project's operator, Brazil's state-run Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ). Both Papa-Terra and Frade are located in the offshore Campos basin where most of Brazil's 2 million-barrel-per-day output comes from. Analysts say the spill is likely to increasingly politicize the governance of the country's oil sector. It has already given ammunition to Rio de Janeiro state's lawmakers fighting proposals to share more oil wealth with non-producing states. DEFIANT ON WELL PLANS Moshiri, described as premature the government's ban on its drilling, which it had already halted voluntarily shortly after the oil leak was discovered. It said the crude leaked from fissures in the seabed after rock \"parted\" during drilling. He said the company had not given up on plans to drill another separate well at Frade that would perforate through to deeper subsalt oil reserves, despite the energy regulator turning down its request for that project this week. The regulator, the ANP, said the well would be at even greater risk of spill than the one that leaked because of the greater depths involved. Moshiri said the spill had cost Chevron about $30 million in clean-up costs. It had invested about $20 million in the well it was drilling which it is now working to permanently seal off. The head of Chevron's Brazil operations, George Buck, apologized for the November 8 spill at the country's Congress on Wednesday where he insisted the company used all its resources to stop the flow of oil which has now virtually ceased. Chevron has acknowledged that it was mistaken in its estimates of pressure and rock strength in the reservoir it was targeting. It is the majority stakeholder in the Frade concession with Brazil's state-run Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ) and a Japanese consortium. The only rig working for Chevron off Brazil is Transocean Ltd's ( RIGN.VX ) Sedco 706, which drilled the well that leaked. Brazil's national energy regulator, ANP, said on Friday the oil stain on the ocean surface many miles out to sea was shrinking but still visible.

      " ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's budget deficit will not fall below a key euro zone ceiling in 2014 as planned, if the debt-laden country fails to decide additional austerity measures in June, a set of updated forecasts revealed on Friday. \n",
      " Assuming no more measures are taken, the budget gap will narrow to just 4.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2015 instead of the 1.1 percent assumed under a previous set of forecasts made in June, the finance ministry data showed. The new figures are part of the country's updated mid-term fiscal plan for 2012-2015, which was revised to take into account its deeper-than-expected recession and a debt cut plan agreed by its international lenders last month. Greece is struggling to meet budget targets as it goes through its fourth year of recession, and needs the next tranche of funds under an ongoing EU/IMF bailout to avoid bankruptcy next month. Euro zone countries should have budget deficits below 3 percent of GDP, a target Greece still aims to achieve in three years, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters. \"We stick to the target to reduce the deficit to below 3 percent by 2015,\" the official said. \"The revised mid-term plan does not take into account the additional fiscal measures that will be finalized and announced in June,\" he added. Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said on Wednesday that the country's next government will have to specify new fiscal measures after elections are held early next year. But the front-runner to win the poll, the conservative New Democracy party, has ruled out any fresh austerity despite backing the broad fiscal targets. Under the new set of budget forecasts, debt as a percentage of GDP would fall to 125.6 percent in 2015 from about 162 percent this year, assuming the debt reduction plan agreed last month goes ahead. The bailout is aimed at reducing Greece's debt to 120 percent of GDP by 2020. (Reporting by Harry Papachristou and Lefteris Papadimas)\n",

      " FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) will axe its Maybach superluxury brand after years of losses and moribund sales, replacing the car with more expensive models of its Mercedes-Benz S-Class flagship saloon starting in 2013. \n",
      " \"We held extensive discussions internally about which way would promise the greatest success in the luxury segment, and we came to the conclusion that the sales chances for the Mercedes brand were better than that of Maybach,\" Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \"It would not be sensible to develop a successor model for the current Maybach,\" he added, according to an excerpt of the interview, which will be published in the German daily in full on Saturday. Instead, he plans to extend the number of S-Class derivatives from a current three to six in order to boost the model's volume, possibly even doubling it to 80,000 cars a year. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on which new S-Class derivatives would be added on top of the existing saloon, long-wheelbase saloon and the coupe, sold under the CL-Class nameplate. \"Maybach sold cars upwards of 300,000 euros, but what we want to do now is move into the 100,000-300,000 euros segment -- where the annual volumes are in the thousands and not the hundreds,\" the spokesman said. BRITISH MARQUES TOO STRONG Originally aiming for volumes of 1,000 cars a year when launched in late 2002, Daimler has seen Maybach's annual sales slump to around 200 cars, where they held steady last year. Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ), by comparison, took far more successful excursions into the superluxury segment thanks to scooping up British marques Bentley and Rolls-Royce, respectively. Auto industry experts have long argued Maybach, a brand that before its revival in 2002 had not been in production since 1940, enjoyed no strong standing among the discriminating wealthy. BMW's Rolls-Royce, by contrast, has seen volumes soar 41 percent to 2,441 cars in the first nine months of this year, driven particularly by its lower price, higher volume Ghost model. VW's Bentley, best known for grand tourers like the Continental GT rather than large saloons, managed to increase its sales by 31 percent to 4,763 cars. The Maybach became such an image liability that Daimler stopped publishing monthly volume statistics several years ago, preferring only to present the figure in its annual accounts. A spokeswoman for BMW's Rolls-Royce declined to comment on the Maybach decision. (Reporting by  Christiaan Hetzner ; Editing by Will Waterman and  Jane Merriman )\n"

      " (Reuters) - A federal judge has said credit ratings are not always protected opinion under the First Amendment, a defeat for credit rating agencies in a lawsuit brought by investors who lost money on mortgage-backed securities. \n",
      " The November 12 decision was a little-noticed setback for McGraw-Hill Cos' Standard & Poor's, Moody's Corp's Moody's Investors Service and Fimalac SA's Fitch Ratings, which have long invoked First Amendment free speech protection to defend against lawsuits over their ratings. These agencies had argued that the Constitution protected them from claims they issued inflated ratings on more than $5 billion of securities issued in 2006 and 2007, and backed by loans from former Thornburg Mortgage Inc and other lenders. But the judge said the ratings were shared with too small a group of investors to deserve the broad protection sought. \"The court rejects the rating agency defendants' arguments that the First Amendment provides any protection to them under the facts of this case,\" U.S. District Judge James Browning in Albuquerque, New Mexico, wrote in a 273-page opinion. Browning nonetheless dismissed claims accusing Moody's and Fitch, but not S&P, of misrepresentations, saying the investors did not adequately allege that the two agencies did not believe their ratings, or knowingly concealed their inaccuracy. He also said federal law preempts some arguments that the investors used to recover under New Mexico securities law. The judge said the investors may file an amended complaint, which had sought class-action status. If the state law claims went forward, it could provide an avenue for investors to go after the agencies in other states. Browning had denied the agencies' motion to dismiss the complaint on September 30, without giving reasons. S&P, in a statement, called the First Amendment ruling \"inconsistent\" with other court rulings. Fitch spokesman Daniel Noonan said that agency is pleased that claims against it were dismissed. Moody's and lawyers for the investors declined to comment or had no immediate comment. Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are among the other defendants in the case. Rating agencies have been widely faulted by investors, regulators and Congress for contributing to the global credit and financial crises that began in 2007 by issuing high ratings on debt that did not deserve it. Thornburg made \"jumbo\" home loans, larger than $417,000, to borrowers considered good credit risks, but collapsed after margin calls and a plunge in the value of mortgages it held. The Santa Fe, New Mexico-based lender filed for bankruptcy on May 1, 2009, and is now called TMST Inc. LIMITED DISTRIBUTION Investors led by two pension funds, the Maryland-National Capital Park & Planning Commission Employees' Retirement System, and the Midwest Operating Engineers Pension Trust Fund in Illinois, claimed the agencies issued false and misleading investment-grade ratings for Thornburg securities, and were paid \"substantial\" sums that compromised their independence. But Browning said the ratings were distributed only to a \"limited group\" of investors, not the public at large. He also said that unlike publicly traded companies, the trusts from which the securities were issued were not \"public figures\" entitled to more protections. \"The court rejects the rating agency defendants' argument that the First Amendment protections regarding provably false opinions apply to their credit ratings,\" Browning wrote. Rating agencies have largely been successful in raising the First Amendment defense. For example, in September, a federal judge threw out a lawsuit by then-Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray on behalf of pension funds, and said ratings were \"predictive opinions.\" In contrast, a Manhattan federal judge, in a 2009 ruling involving Morgan Stanley, said the defense does not apply when ratings were provided to a \"select group of investors\" in a private placement. S&P has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission not to file threatened civil charges over its ratings for a 2007 offering, Delphinus CDO 2007-1. The case is Genesee County Employees' Retirement System et al v. Thornburg Mortgage Securities Trust 2006-3 et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Mexico, No. 09-00300.

      " TOKYO  (Reuters) - The British ex-CEO of Japan's Olympus Corp emerged from a frosty meeting of directors on Friday convinced its board would eventually quit over an accounting scandal engulfing the firm, but he said he wasn't \"begging\" to return and clean up the mess. \n",
      " Michael Woodford, still an Olympus director despite being fired as CEO and blowing the whistle over the scam, described the meeting as a tense encounter with no handshakes or apologies offered from the men who had sacked him barely a month ago. Instead, he said, the board had agreed that the once-proud maker of cameras and medical equipment should strive to avoid being delisted from the Tokyo stock exchange, a sanction that would make the business more vulnerable to takeover. \"I just see a lot of suffering and misery for no gain,\" Woodford said of the prospect of a delisting. \"But we should have the investigation, it shouldn't be fudged,\" he told a news conference after the almost-two-hour meeting at Olympus's Tokyo headquarters, where he was mobbed by reporters and TV crews as he entered and left the building. Woodford, back in Japan for the first time since fleeing the country right after his October 14 sacking, said there had been no talk at the meeting of him returning to his former post. \"I'm not begging to come back,\" he said, though he added that he was willing to do so if shareholders desired it. \"I didn't volunteer for this, I'm not a hero,\" he added. \"There was a tension in the room, but there seemed to be an understanding that it was in no one's interest to raise the temperature,\" he said. \"They didn't shake my hand and I didn't offer mine. We said good morning and goodbye.\" Major foreign shareholders have called for Woodford to be immediately reinstated, saying he can restore faith in the 92-year-old firm. The visit by Woodford, who also met this week with police and other investigators probing the scandal, coincided with a rally in Olympus shares, which have been buoyed by speculation the firm can escape delisting. The stock rose as much as 25 percent on Friday before closing up 8.6 percent at 1,107 yen. It has rebounded a whopping 77 percent in just four trading days, though it is still down more than half since the day before Woodford's dismissal. Woodford said Olympus could survive as an independent entity as long as banks, so far supportive, kept backing it. DUBIOUS DEALS, CRIME SUSPICION Olympus had fired Woodford, a rare foreign CEO in Japan, alleging he had failed to adapt to Japanese culture and the company's management style. Woodford says he was axed for questioning dubious merger and acquisition payments. Suspicion has swirled about possible links between the payments and organised crime. Woodford said he had no firm proof of gangster links but urged authorities to \"follow the money.\" \"That would be concerning if organised crime was involved ... but there's no evidence of that to date,\" he said. The 51-year-old freckle-faced Briton had left Japan after his dismissal citing concerns for his safety. Olympus first denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted it had hidden investment losses from investors for two decades and used some of $1.3 billion in M&A payments to aid the cover-up. Woodford said after Friday's board meeting that the top priority was for Olympus to meet a December 14 deadline for filing its financial statements for the six-months to September -- after which, he added, current management should go. The company would be automatically delisted if it misses the deadline. Even if it meets the deadline, the Tokyo Stock Exchange can still delist it, depending on the scale of past misstatements or if a link is found to \"yakuza\" gangsters. A third-party panel appointed by Olympus to look into the accounting scam said this week that it had not yet found any evidence of involvement by organised crime. AUDITORS, GOVERNANCE The Olympus affair has raised questions about whether its auditors, the Japanese arms of global giants KPMG and Ernst & Young, should have done more to follow up on red flags. KPMG'S chairman, Michael Andrew, on Friday called for a global set of standards for the auditing industry but said that KPMG had done the right thing in the actions it took pertaining to the Japanese company. \"What is pretty evident to me is that it is a very, very significant fraud,\" Andrew said in a speech in Hong Kong. \"We should wait for the Japanese authorities to disclose that.\" \"I think it is very hard to jump to the conclusion that it's a corporate governance failure,\" he said. The scandal has also revived criticism of corporate governance in a country that Woodford said needed people who would \"challenge and scrutinize.\" He also took a swipe at mainstream Japanese media for being slow to cover the scandal. \"What Japan should do is look around the world for the best human resources ... It would be sad if no more gaijin come,\" he said, using the Japanese word for foreigners. On the eve of the board meeting, two Olympus directors and an internal auditor blamed for the scandal quit and the president announced that current management was ready to step down once the firm's recovery was on track. Current president Shuichi Takayama should stay until December 14, but changes could start thereafter, Woodford said, adding that his fellow directors seemed to realize they would have to go but had given no explicit commitment to resign. Woodford also said Japanese authorities probing the scandal, whom he met in Tokyo on Thursday, wanted to talk to him again. Tokyo police, prosecutors and regulators have launched a rare joint probe of the scandal. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Britain's Serious Fraud Office are also looking into the affair. Shareholders have asked Olympus to seek more damages from former and current executives if they are found to have caused losses to company value through acquisitions at the center of a scandal, the company said in a statement on Friday.

      " BUDAPEST  (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's cut Hungary's debt to \"junk\" grade late on Thursday, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's unorthodox economic policies and prompting his government to denounce the move as a \"financial attack.\" \n",
      " Moody's lowered Hungary's sovereign rating by one notch to Ba1, just below investment grade, with a negative outlook, hours after rival Standard & Poor's held fire on a flagged downgrade after Budapest said it would seek international aid. The move followed warnings from all three major ratings agencies that Orban's policies, which have eschewed traditional austerity in favor of revenue-boosting steps like a special bank tax and the nationalization of $14 billion in pension assets, had put Hungary's finances at risk. It also came after Orban relaunched aid talks this week with the International Monetary Fund, a dramatic reversal after he cut cooperation with the Fund short last year after sweeping a 2010 election on a vow to regain \"economic sovereignty.\" Moody's cited rising uncertainty about Hungary's ability to meet fiscal goals, high debt levels and what it called increasingly constrained medium-term growth prospects. \"Moody's believes that the combined impact of these factors will adversely impact the government's financial strength and erode its shock-absorption capacity,\" it said in a statement. Hungarian bond yields soared by about a full percentage point, lifting its entire bond curve above 9 percent, but yields dropped by about 20-30 basis points in afternoon trade as high yields prompted buyers to enter the market. The cost of insuring Hungarian debt against default jumped to new record highs at 635 basis points, eclipsing earlier highs hit in March 2009. The forint rebounded from morning falls of about 1.6 percent to trade at 314.10 by 1259 GMT. The Czech crown fell to a 17-month low and the Polish zloty dipped beyond the 4.50 per euro level and briefly approached a 27-month low of 4.537 hit in September. Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said that although most of central and Eastern Europe was better off than southern Europe, fears over the euro zone debt crisis and the Hungarian downgrade indicated turmoil ahead. \"There's no question that sentiment toward the region is deteriorating rapidly and that even the most resilient economies are in for a rough ride in the months ahead,\" he said. SHORT-LIVED SURPLUS The downgrade is a major setback for Orban, whose Fidesz party ousted Socialists he has blamed for economic mismanagement by winning a two-thirds majority in last year's election. He has cut taxes for families and small firms and raised tariffs on banks, utilities and other big, mainly foreign-owned, firms, putting the country of 10 million on track to run one of the European Union's only budget surpluses this year. But his policies have failed to spur growth and irked voters who resent his aggressive tactics and oppose his seizing private pension savings to fund an inefficient public sector. The government's unpredictability and rising pressure from the euro zone crisis have hammered investor sentiment. The forint has fallen 16.3 percent since July 1, versus 12.6 percent for its regional peer the Polish zloty and 6.7 percent for the Czech crown. The Economy Ministry has blamed the currency's plummet -- which has hit Hungarians who have borrowed in foreign currency -- on market speculators. It said the downgrade was unwarranted, the latest in a string of \"financial attacks against Hungary.\" \"Obviously, the forint's weakening is not justified by either the performance of the Hungarian economy, or the shape of the budget,\" the Economy Ministry said in a statement. The government cited its commitment to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent of economic output next year, 1 percent of GDP's worth of reserves in the 2012 budget, and an expected decline in debt levels, as arguments against the rating cut. But Moody's said the government's 2.5 percent of GDP budget deficit target for next year may be difficult to meet due to high funding costs and low economic growth. The weak forint pushed Hungary's government debt to 82 percent of economic output by the end of the third quarter, undoing the impact of Orban's $14 billion pension asset grab. Hungary must roll over 4.7 billion euros in external debt next year as it starts repaying part of its 20 billion euros, 2008 bailout from the IMF -- something that could be solved with a new financing deal. In his unexpected about face on potential IMF support, Orban made clear that he would not accept any demands in exchange for cash at the ready should the need arise. but Moody's said the request to resume talks illustrated Budapest's funding challenges. \"Even with such an arrangement, the government's debt structure will remain vulnerable to shocks in the medium term, which are inconsistent with a Baa3 rating,\" Moody's said. \"SAFETY NET\" The European Commission forecasts the economy will expand by only 0.5 percent at most next year, far lower than the 3 percent initially forecast in Orban's medium-term budget plan. Complicating that further is high unemployment, weak bank lending and 5 trillion forints in mostly Swiss franc denominated foreign currency mortgages which have seen repayments soar due to the franc's strength and forint's slide. Orban has introduced an option for families to repay loans at exchange rates below market levels, but that has roiled markets and inflicted billions of forints of losses on the bank sector, undermining growth and lending. Economists said the gloomy economic outlook could combine with the downgrade and increase pressure on Budapest to accept an IMF deal with the monitoring and policy recommendations Orban has spurned. \"As the economy will tumble into recession by around the turn of the year, we expect that it will have no other choice than to accept any IMF proposal, even if this would include conditionalities,\" said Michal Dybula at BNP Paribas. Moody's said it would further lower Hungary's rating if there was a significant decline in government financial strength due to a lack of progress on structural reforms and implementation of a medium-term plan. The ratings cut came just hours after S&P deferred its decision on a possible downgrade of Hungary to non-investment grade until end-February, pending IMF talks. Fitch, another rating agency which has Hungary in the lowest investment-grade category, has said an agreement on a new IMF program could reduce downward pressure on Hungary's rating.

      " TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell for the first time in four months in the year to October after a cigarette tax hike a year ago dropped out from calculations revealing persistent deflation caused by chronically weak domestic demand. \n",
      " In fact, November data for the Tokyo area showed deeper declines that exceeded analysts' forecasts and backed the view that the Bank of Japan will maintain ultra-easy monetary policy for the foreseeable future. A narrower measure of prices that excludes both food and energy fell from a year ago in a sign that the world's third-largest economy continued to struggle with lackluster job market, weak consumer demand and excess capacity. Core consumer prices fell 0.1 percent as forecast in a sign of weak aggregate demand as a strong yen and spillover from Europe's sovereign debt crisis dampen export demand. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa on Friday expressed the central bank's growing alarm that the euro zone crisis may bring more pain for the Japanese economy. \"Europe's sovereign problems have affected Japan through the yen's strength and stock price falls. As emerging economies that have close trading relations with Europe slow down, Japan's exports to those economies may decline,\" Shirakawa said. \"The impact on the Japanese economy may grow bigger.\" Japan's economy rebounded from a recession triggered by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and grew 1.5 percent in the third quarter. But it is expected to slow sharply this quarter as the initial spurt driven by companies restoring supply chains and production facilities tails off. With an expected boost from a $155 billion reconstruction budget passed this week still some months away, policymakers in Tokyo may feel pressure to help the economy again with yen-selling intervention and monetary policy easing. \"The price data underscores the sluggishness of domestic demand as the economy's recovery has taken a breather because of a delay in reconstruction efforts and a global economic slowdown,\" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo. Finance Minister Jun Azumi pledged to shield exporters from sharp currency moves while expressing frustration with Europe's inability to contain the debt rout that has been driving nervous investors away from the euro and into more stable markets such as Japanese government debt. \"It's really a shame because Europe's problems have started to intensify just when we were starting to see some bright signs on Japan's horizon,\" Azumi said. FRESH WARNING The yen hovered around 77.35 yen against the dollar on Friday, having firmed gradually since Japan sold nearly $100 billion worth of yen last month, knocking it down from record a record high of 75.31 per dollar. More gains threatening Japan's recovery could spur further action from the finance ministry and the BOJ. For now, however, Shirakawa stuck with the bank's view that rebuilding efforts from the devastating March 11 and continued growth in Japan's main export markets in Asia should help sustain moderate economic recovery. \"The outlook on the BOJ's easing measures will depend largely on forex moves. Europe's debt problems are expected to be prolonged and the effects from Japan's intervention and the BOJ's easing steps may fade early next year,\" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance. \"So there is a chance of additional BOJ easing in January or February.\" While the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile prices of fresh food, inched down for the first time in four months, the so-called core-core index, which also excludes energy prices and is similar to the core U.S. index, fell 1.0 percent in the year to October. Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, fell 0.5 percent in the year to November, compared with the median estimate for a 0.3 percent annual decline. JPCPIT=ECI Some economists say consumer prices could fall further in coming months as a slowing global economy dents oil prices, while deflationary pressures persist.

      " (Reuters) - Retailers were hoping for more shoppers like Shawn Elzia as the annual Black Friday bargain stampede marked the unofficial start of what is widely expected to be a middling holiday shopping season. \n",
      " The Brooklyn, New York teacher, one of hundreds of thousands of shoppers jostling for deals around the country, said he ended up spending about 25 percent more than he planned, even while worrying about the state of the economy. \"I did not expect such deals,\" the 33-year old said as he left a Macy's store in Jersey City, New Jersey clutching bags full of clothing for himself and his family. \"It's slashed down to the bones,\" he said. \"There were some great discounts if you showed up early.\" Deals are always part of the picture on the Friday after Thanksgiving. This year was notable for an earlier opening for some retailers and possibly for the one shopper using pepper spray to make sure she could get a popular video game system. The early start by stores brought out younger shoppers such as Alina Ybarra, who spent the wee hours of the morning with her friends as they all looked for items for themselves. \"It's really chaotic,\" Ybarra, 17, said of her first Black Friday outing as she finished her shopping in Santa Monica, California. She said that she liked the deals at stores such as Gap Inc's Old Navy and Urban Outfitters. \"It seems like a lot of teenagers were the primary shoppers, maybe because of the hour, but I think net-net it's not really going to result in an incremental positive for retailers,\" Ed Yruma, senior equity analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said after checking out crowds at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. He said shoppers were not carrying a lot of shopping bags. Leon Clare, 24, and Shawn Sykes, 27, both U.S. Navy Corpsmen, drove about 125 miles from 29 Palms Marine Base to Santa Monica so they each could spend close to $175 on a pair of Air Jordan Retro 3 shoes in \"Black Cement,\" popular new sneakers from Nike Inc. \"This is for me,\" said Clare, who plans to spend more on holiday gifts later on in the season. \"I'm leaving for Afghanistan in March. I'm getting something for everyone, just in case I don't come back.\" WORRIED... AGAIN More than 120 stores at the Mall of America opened at midnight. The crowd at that point was about 15,000 people. Mall operators estimated that it was the largest crowd ever at the mall, which is big enough to hold seven Yankee Stadiums. While eager shoppers emerged from stores around the country lugging big-screen TVs and bags full of video games and toys, it was far from certain that people will pull out their wallets for much more than the best deals this year. Shoppers with limited budgets started using layaway at chains such as Walmart as early as October. Retail shares fell more than the overall market on Friday. \"Americans are still worried about jobs, still worried about the economy,\" said Mike Thielmann, group executive vice president at J.C. Penney, who noted that shoppers were buying gifts and for themselves, and said jewelry was selling well. In Houston, Rico Salvosa, 60, bought two cameras at Best Buy and said he had saved about $170. \"It's worse than before because business is slow,\" Salvosa, who wholesales stone countertops, said as he left the store with his daughters. \"I don't have a lot of savings for holiday shopping. I told them, 'I cannot buy everything that you'd like.'\" Competition among the retailers was fierce as it was among shoppers, as some stores opened hours earlier than before. Outside Macy's flagship store in New York, some Occupy Wall Street activists chanted \"boycott Macy's\" and \"stop supporting big corporations\" even as about 9,000 people lined up to shop when the store opened at midnight. Opening early appeared to work, judging from the long lines at stores such as Macy's, Toys R Us, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. \"It was crazy around midnight and one in the morning,\" said a Target employee at the chain's East Harlem, New York store, where the crowd thinned out later on Friday morning. Even after a Toys R Us in New Jersey had been open for nearly an hour, at 9:50 p.m. EST on Thursday night, there was still a line of about 300 people waiting to get inside. The 24 hours that started at 9 p.m. Thursday will be the biggest in retail history, with sales estimated at $27 billion, according to Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, one of the few experts predicting a strong season. The term \"Black Friday\" commonly refers to the day after Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the busy holiday shopping season when retailers do brisk business. (See related story: Spirited 'Black Friday' has dark roots. While it is the busiest day of the year in terms of store traffic, it does not always mean that sales will soar for the season. Despite brisk sales right after Thanksgiving in 2008 and 2009, total holiday season sales fell as the recession gripped the country. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, expects 152 million people to hit stores this weekend, up 10.1 percent from last year. Yet it expects sales for the full November-December holiday season to rise just 2.8 percent, well below the pace of last year when sales rose 5.2 percent. Luxury chains such as Saks Inc and those catering to lower-income shoppers, such as dollar stores, are expected to do well this shopping season. \"For our products that are $25,000 and up, growth is phenomenal,\" said Mark Vadon, founder of online jewelry retailer Blue Nile. \"Price points under $100 are also doing really well. For the mass part of the market, consumers are strapped and being a lot more wary.\" Overall, retail executives and analysts expect a more competitive shopping season than in 2010. Unemployment remains at 9 percent, European debt woes are weighing on the stock market, and consumer confidence remains spotty. Online sales on Thursday and Friday surpassed last year, and more shoppers used their mobile devices to buy, according to IBM data. The amount U.S. shoppers spent via eBay Mobile more than doubled on Thanksgiving, while eBay's PayPal Mobile unit saw a five-fold increase in global mobile payment volume versus last Thanksgiving. The online push put pressure on some companies. Walmart.com saw some very high traffic, so some customers may have experienced delays as they tried to check out, it said. Even Apple Inc gets into the Christmas spirit on Black Friday, the only day that it usually offers discounts. This year it offered its typical $101 discount on its $900-plus Mac laptops and $41 or more off its $499-plus iPads. (Reporting by  Dhanya Skariachan ,  Liana B.

      " ROME/MADRID  (Reuters) - Italy's borrowing costs soared to their highest levels since Rome joined the euro on Friday, piling pressure on the newly installed government of Mario Monti at the end of a week in which the euro zone crisis tainted even safe haven Germany. \n",
      " A punishing bond sale, in which Italy was forced to pay a record 6.5 percent for six months paper, came after a disastrous German bond auction earlier in the week and the leaders of France, Germany and Italy failed to make headway in tackling the growing debt crisis. Amid signs that the euro zone contagion is spreading, indications emerged in Madrid that the People's Party, getting ready to form a government in the coming weeks, may apply for international aid to shore up its finances. After winning an election this month, the PP under Mariano Rajoy inherits an economy on the verge of recession, a tough 2012 public deficit target, financing costs driven to near unsustainable levels by nervous debt markets and a battered bank sector with billions of euros of troubled assets on its books. Tuesday's launch by the International Monetary Fund of a credit facility for fiscally responsible countries at risk from the euro zone debt crisis gives it a potential lifeline it may wish to exploit. \"I don't believe the decision has been made ... but it is one of the options on the table, because I've been asked about it. But we need more time and more information on the current state of things,\" a source close to the PP told Reuters. Italy's auction on Friday, described by one analyst as \"awful,\" spooked investors further and pushed two-year yields on the secondary market to an eye-watering euro lifetime high of more than 8 percent. Longer term debt is above a \"red line\" of 7 percent which forced Portugal, Greece and Ireland into bailouts that Europe could not afford for the much bigger Italian economy. Spiralling borrowing costs have added to pressure on Monti's government of technocrats, hastily sworn in this month after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was bundled out of office as economic pressures grew. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn threw his  backing behind Monti but warned that swift action was needed to contain the escalating euro zone debt crisis. He dismissed fears that the euro's survival was in question but said the crisis had reached the heart of the single currency. \"This contagion effect has been touching the proximity of the core and even touching the core itself,\" he told a news conference after meeting Monti in Rome. \"It shows that this is an increasingly systemic phenomenon, which calls for strong financial firewalls in order to contain this contagion and have a counterforce to this market turbulence.\" EYES ON ECB With the European Central Bank coming under increasing pressure to take more effective action, something it and Germany continue to oppose in public, officials suggested one possible scenario that could break the impasse. A push by euro zone countries toward very close fiscal integration could give the ECB the necessary room for maneuver to dramatically scale up euro zone bond purchases and stabilize markets. The ECB, which cannot directly finance governments, has been buying Italian and Spanish bonds intermittently on the secondary market since August to try to keep their borrowing costs and contain Europe's sovereign debt problem. But Italian and Spanish yields have nonetheless reached levels that economists see as unsustainable, raising the possibility that Rome and Madrid will be forced to seek emergency international funding. \"We are not far from a point when the disruption in the markets is so big that monetary policy transmission does not work at all,\" said one euro zone official involved in shaping the euro zone's policy response to the crisis. \"If the ECB has the assurance that we are moving toward a fiscal union, they could be ready to go all out,\" he said Belgium, which had prided itself on being able to stabilize its debt position despite having had no government for the past 18 months, saw its credit rating downgraded. Political deadlock in Brussels prompted Standard & Poor's to cut Belgium's credit rating to double-A from double-A-plus, citing concerns about funding and market pressures, as the euro zone debt crisis continues to worsen. \"We need a reply that is clear and credible if we are to avoid the worst,\" Belgium's caretaker prime minister, Yves Leterme, told Belgian television. The downgrade followed difficulties this week in Belgium's drawn-out attempt to form a government. Elio Di Rupo, leader of the French-speaking Socialists, had been trying to form a government based on a six-party coalition. But he tendered his resignation on Monday after talks for a 2012 budget - agreement on which is a condition for forming a government - ground to a halt. Greek, the source of the euro zone's debt crisis, provided another source of dispute. Investors' worries intensified after reports that Greece was demanding harsh conditions from creditors on a proposed bond swap -- critical to reduce its debt and avoid default. Banks represented by the Institute of International Finance agreed last month to write off the notional value of their Greek bondholdings by 50 percent to reduce Greece's debt ratio to 120 percent of its gross domestic product by 2020. But Greece was demanding that its new bonds' net present value -- a measure of the current worth of future cash flows -- be cut to 25 percent, a far harsher measure than the banks had in mind, according to people briefed on the matter.

      "-- By Jed Horowitz\n",
      "-- Fri Nov 25, 2011 4:51pm EST\n",

      "\n",
      " (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp, which was derided for a plan to charge some of its large corporate and investment management clients for holding their deposits, appears to have flinched. \n",
      " The bank has not assessed a penny since warning clients about the possible deposit fee in early August, officials told Reuters, although it remains burdened by cash that it cannot profitably redeploy at rock-bottom interest rates. The fee of 0.13 percent was to have taken effect on August 8 for accounts with more than $50 million that had soared well above their monthly averages as clients fled short-term investments for the safety of U.S. banks. \"My guess is that the backlash was pretty stringent and they decided not to do it,\" said William Gerber, chief financial officer of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, a cash-management client of Bank of New York. \"I can see their problem but I'm not that empathetic considering all the fees we've been waiving.\" He was referring to hundreds of millions of dollars of money-market mutual fund fees that financial companies have waived over the past two years lest investors realize negative returns on their fund holdings. Unlike Bank of America, which was shamed into withdrawing a plan to charge its customers $5 for debit card transactions after a torrent of articles ridiculing the proposal, Bank of New York said that its super-sized version of its deposit fee is not dead. \"We haven't charged any clients to date, and the policy remains in place as markets remain unsettled and interest rates remain at historic lows,\" BNY Mellon spokesman Ron Sommer wrote in an email. The fee, he added, was aimed at \"a small number of clients with extraordinarily high and volatile deposit levels.\" In its August letter, the bank urged clients to consider cash investment options \"to minimize any effect\" of the mooted fee. ANXIETY DROVE DEPOSITS The plan was prompted by a flood of deposits from companies, money-market funds and other clients fleeing short-term investments that exposed them in late July to the then-unfolding Greek financial crisis and from U.S. government securities amid a Congressional impasse over raising the U.S. debt ceiling. A source said Bank of New York's deposits swelled about 39 percent in a period of two weeks in late July and early August to about $250 billion, underscoring the fragility of the global financial system at any sign of panic and creating balance-sheet management challenges for the bank. At the end of September, deposits were 45 percent higher than a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said in discussing third-quarter earnings, though he said the influx had stabilized since earlier in the quarter. Sommer declined to discuss the deposit levels. Bank of New York continues to attract a heavy flow of cash since it has higher ratings from Moody's Investor Services than trust bank competitors such as State Street Corp and Northern Trust Corp, another official said. Those banks did not match Bank of New York's deposit fee announcement, although some commercial banks with larger lending businesses that fund loans with deposits have been passing FDIC fees to some of their small-business customers. The policy was initiated under former Bank of New York Chief Executive Robert Kelly, who was ousted in early September and replaced by Gerald Hassell, a 30-plus-year veteran of Bank of New York who some insiders said was more sensitive to client relationships. Kelly took the top role when the New York bank combined in 2007 with Pittsburgh-based Mellon Financial Corp, which he led. \"I believe they are backing away from the strategy, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in an email. \"Not certain if it is customer backlash or a rethinking of strategy under new CEO.\" Custody banks make most of their money from holding securities and other assets for clients worldwide and ensuring that they are properly accounted for and exchanged when clients demand. Bank of New York swapped its 338 retail branches and small business banking businesses in 2006 for JPMorgan Chase & Co's corporate trust business and $150 million in cash. The deal helped Bank of New York avoid some of the credit problems that continue to depress earnings of more traditional banks, but deprives it of the ability to negotiate on loans and other businesses in return for winning custody activities. Because rates are so low, many custody banks today are less eager to attract new business or are more aggressive about insisting that clients offset the low-return deposit business by using other services, said Anthony Carfang, head of Treasury Strategies, a Chicago-based consulting firm.

      " Wall Street traded higher for most of the abbreviated session on hopes that \"Black Friday,\" the traditional start of the U.S. holiday shopping season, would support major retailers. But gains were quickly offset by headlines out of Europe that further dented market sentiment. With less than 20 minutes before the close, all three stock indexes had turned negative. Yields on Italy's debt approached recent highs that sparked a sell-off in world markets. Italy paid a record 6.5 percent to borrow money over six months on Friday, and its longer-term funding costs soared far above levels seen as sustainable for public finances. High debt yields from major economies in Europe such as Spain, France and Germany suggest investing in the region is seen as being more risky. \"Trading remains cautious (since) the poor auction of German bonds mid-week raised concerns the debt crisis is spreading to Europe's core,\" said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederick Ruffy. Adding to concerns, Standard & Poor's downgraded Belgium's credit rating to double-A from double-A-plus, citing concerns about funding and market pressures. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slipped 25.77 points, or 0.23 percent, to 11,231.78 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  declined 3.12 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,158.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  shed 18.57 points, or 0.75 percent, to 2,441.51. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 4.7 percent, giving back almost two-thirds of its gains in October, the market's best month in 20 years. The Dow was off 4.8 percent for the week and the Nasdaq fell 5.1 percent. Pressuring the Nasdaq, shares of Netflix ( NFLX.O ) fell 6.8 percent to $63.86. Entertainment companies with major consumer product units ranked among the gainers. U.S.-listed shares of Sony Corp ( SNE.N ) rose 4.2 percent to $16.96. Disney ( DIS.N ) shares rose 0.3 percent to $33.51. Trading volume was thin, as expected, with just 3 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq as the stock market closed at 1 p.m. The day after Thanksgiving is typically one of the lightest trading volume days of the year.

      " NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Global supermarket chains welcomed a long-awaited invitation from India to invest in the country's $450 billion retail market, but they fear the small print may keep a lid on investment in the short term. \n",
      " The government on Thursday approved 51 percent foreign direct investment in supermarkets, paving the way for firms such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Tesco and Carrefour to enter one of the world's largest untapped markets. Shares in Indian retailers jumped -- bucking the weaker stock market trend -- in anticipation of interest from those big foreign retailers. The move may breathe new life into the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who ushered in free market reforms 20 years ago but has been bogged down by corruption scandals and was starting to be seen as a lame duck. As well as appealing to India's burgeoning urban middle class the reform will draw in much-needed new investment to a sputtering economy. Policymakers say spending on cold-storage and warehousing will ease supply-side pressures that have driven inflation close to a double-digit clip. \"It's important not only for raising overall growth, but also for containing inflation and improving the quality of life for over 50 percent of the population,\" said central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao. Investment could exceed $5 billion in the next 5-7 years as hundreds of hypermarkets are opened, said Vijay Karwal, head of retail at the Royal Bank of Scotland. \"There may be a degree of 'catch up' with foreign flows into India retail possibly starting to match, if not exceed, those into China as development picks up pace,\" he said. The move carries risk for Prime Minister Singh, whose party must contest five state elections next year. It is opposed by millions of small shop owners who fear for their livelihoods, and prompted an uproar in India's parliament, which was forced to close until Monday. Some politicians threatened extreme action to prevent supermarkets opening. \"If Wal-Mart tries to open its mall anywhere, I will burn it myself,\" said Uma Bharti, a former state chief minister from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), local media reported. An India-wide group representing small traders said it was planning protests for next week. \"They should have worked on some kind of protectionist mechanism for smaller traders,\" said Praveen Khandelwa, the head of the confederation of all India traders. RIDERS To appease its opponents, the government insisted foreign retailers source almost a third of their produce from small industries, invest a minimum of $100 million in India and spend half of that on \"back end\" infrastructure. An official at one major international retailer said the company was concerned about the numbers the government had mentioned. \"Some of the conditions look quite stringent. The investment in particular -- it's all quite big money. We'd need to know the details, and how that would be accounted for,\" the official said on condition of anonymity. Foreign stores will only be permitted in cities of more than 1 million people, and individual states will decide whether to allow the global giants on to their patch. [ID:nD8E7LL01S] That could, for example, exclude investor-favorite states like Gujarat, which is run by the Hindu nationalist BJP that opposes new foreign supermarkets. Sharma said new investment would create 10 million jobs in the next three years and would not affect small shops, a claim scorned by parties on both the left and right who predict that millions of jobs will be lost. \"We are sitting on a time bomb in terms of employment,\" said economist Jayati Ghosh. She said India should upgrade public and cooperative supply infrastructure, not rely on corporations. The head of Wal-Mart's local cash-and-carry joint venture praised the move, but also struck a note of caution. \"We will need to study the conditions and the finer details of the new policy and the impact that it will have on our ability to do business in India,\" said Raj Jain, CEO of Bharti Wal-Mart. TOUGH GOING Domestic retail chains have operated in India for years but have struggled to expand due to funding difficulties, a lack of expertise and poor roads and cold storage facilities. If political opposition mounts, foreign firms could find the going tough. India's biggest listed company, Reliance Industries, was forced to backtrack on plans in 2007 to open Western-style supermarkets in the state of Uttar Pradesh after huge protests from small traders and political parties. Bijou Kurien, a senior executive at Reliance Retail, said the mood had changed. \"The regulatory and non-regulatory pressures in India are the way of life,\" he said. \"So any person running a business in India has to be able to figure out how to steer their way through all the obstacles that can be in their path.\" He said the back-end and sourcing rules may stop big-box electronics stores from coming into India for now, but said the rules would likely soften in the medium term. The conditions could also deter smaller international retail chains, said Himanshu Pal, global data manager at consultants Kantar Retail. However he said India should appeal to budget chains. \"The Indian shopper is at the moment starved of a discounted, value product offer. A Lidl or an Aldi could be very successful in India.\" Thomas Varghese, CEO of another Indian retailer, Aditya Birla, said the power given to states could be a short-term hurdle, but he predicted most would say yes to supermarkets. \"It most definitely will have an impact and reduce the number of places where foreign retailers can set up shop, but it will still not reduce the interest because 51 cities have a million-plus population,\" he said. In the past, big-ticket reforms have been held back by the devil in the detail. In 2008, the government passed the U.S. civilian nuclear deal aimed at opening up India's nuclear power market to foreign players, hailed as the cornerstone of India's warming ties with the United States. But investments have since languished due to stringent accident liability clauses that U.S. companies say make it too risky to invest.

      " BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone states may ditch plans to impose losses on private bondholders should countries need to restructure their debt under a new bailout fund due to launch in mid-2013, four EU officials told Reuters on Friday. \n",
      " Discussions are taking place against a backdrop of flagging market confidence in the region's debt and as part of wider negotiations over introducing stricter fiscal rules to the EU treaty. Euro zone powerhouse Germany is insisting on tighter budgets and private sector involvement (PSI) in bailouts as a precondition for deeper economic integration among euro zone countries. Commercial banks and insurance companies are still expected to take a hit on their holdings of Greek sovereign bonds as part of the second bailout package being finalized for Athens. But clauses relating to PSI in the statutes of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - the permanent facility scheduled to start operating from July 2013 - could be withdrawn, with the majority of euro zone states now opposed to them. The concern is that forcing the private sector bondholders to take losses if a country restructures its debt is undermining confidence in euro zone sovereign bonds. If those stipulations are removed, most countries in the euro zone argue, market sentiment might improve. \"France, Italy, Spain and all the peripherals\" are in favor of removing the clauses, one EU official told Reuters. \"Against it are Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.\" Austria is also opposed, another source said. A third official said that while German insistence on retaining private sector involvement in the ESM was fading, collective action clauses would only be removed as part of broader negotiations under way over changes to the EU treaty. Berlin wants all 27 EU countries, or at least the 17 in the euro zone, to provide full backing for alterations to the treaty before it will consider giving ground on other issues member states want it to shift on, officials say. Germany is under pressure to soften its opposition to the European Central Bank playing a more direct role in combating the crisis, and member states also want Berlin to give its backing to the idea of jointly issued euro zone bonds. German officials dismiss any suggestion of a 'grand bargain' being put together, but officials in other euro zone capitals, including Brussels, say such a deal is taking shape and suggest Berlin will move when it has the commitments it is seeking, although it's unclear when that will be. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after meeting French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Strasbourg on Thursday that there was no quid pro quo being set up. \"This is not about give and take,\" she said. Euro zone finance ministers will discuss the ESM at a meeting in Brussels on November 29-30, including the implications of dropping collective action clauses from its statutes. COMPLICATIONS While most euro zone countries just want to forget about enforced private sector involvement, some are adamant that there must be a way to ensure banks and not just taxpayers shoulder some of the costs of bailing countries out. Austria's opposition Green Party, whose support the government needs to secure backing for the ESM in the Vienna parliament, insists collective action clauses must remain a part of the ESM. It's also far from unclear whether the finance committee of the German lower house Bundestag would agree to such changes being made to the ESM. Any changes to the mechanism would have to be approved by all member states and ratified by national parliaments before they can take effect, meaning fixed Austrian and German opposition could derail the push for changes. Germany and some other member states were hoping to bring the ESM, which will have a lending capacity of 500 billion euros, into force as early as July next year, but disagreement over its structure could delay that.

      " ESTORIL, Portugal  (Reuters) - Europe has still not found a solution to its sovereign debt crisis that would restore investor confidence, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Friday, advocating greater integration as the way to move forward. \n",
      " \"The truth is, that so far there is no response to the sovereign (debt) crisis that restores confidence to investors,\" Barroso told journalists on the fringes of a conference in Portugal. \"As long as that does not happen we will have very serious problems and debates in Europe.\" Asked about the role of the European Central Bank, which many economists say has to adopt a role of lender of last resort to resolve the crisis, Barroso said the bank had to remain independent. \"I can say that in the Commission, we always respected the independence of the European Central Bank, it is essential to have an independent central bank which is not subject to political pressure,\" he said. Germany has strongly resisted any suggestions that the central bank act as lender of last resort for indebted countries or carry out so-called 'quantitative easing' like the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England have done to support their economies. \"We have confidence that the European Central Bank will carry out its role as it has done so far,\" Barroso said. Barroso defended the Commission's proposal, launched this week, on the issue of joint euro bonds as one possible solution to the crisis, which has been opposed by Germany. On Wednesday, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, proposed intrusive laws to ensure budgets of euro zone countries do not break European Union rules and that their borrowing falls, which, once in place, could lead to joint debt issuance. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said it was \"extraordinarily inappropriate\" for the European Commission to make proposals for joint bond issuance at this stage, but Barroso did not see Germany's stance as a major problem. \"Germany's position as far as I know, is that euro bonds can be considered when there is greater integration and discipline in the euro zone, so we are not that far apart,\" Barroso said. \"We though it was the time to launch the discussion. We, in the Commission, have the duty to launch and propose ideas and afterwards, obviously, it is up to member states to adopt them or not.\" Merkel said this week that changing the European treaty to pave the way for closer European integration was vital to solving the debt crisis and restoring investor confidence. Barroso said the Commission was open to the idea of revising European treaties to find a solution to the crisis but any changes should only be carried out in order to deepen integration. \"The European Commission is open to treaty revision if it is to reinforce and to give greater governance and more integration in the euro zone, and not to divide Europe,\" he said.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - A behind-the-scenes tussle for control over a 7.5 billion euro ($10 billion) share sale by Italy's Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ) has shown how increasingly tense market conditions are driving a wedge between investment banks. \n",
      " When the opportunity to be involved in a big deal comes along, banks are usually quick to pile in, with fees, league table credit and client relationships to play for, as well as all-important kudos. But the risk in taking on any transaction in such uncertain markets, let alone underwriting the shares of an Italian bank at a time when Italy's economy is being sucked ever deeper into the euro zone debt crisis, has brought strains to the fore. U.S. heavyweights Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan considered the risk involved in Unicredit's offering too great for the potential reward on offer, according to a report by IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. The 14-strong syndicate of banks appointed will underwrite between 700 million and 850 million euros worth of shares each and will receive fees between 2 and 2.5 percent, said a person close to Unicredit who attended the meeting with the banks. That source said that when Goldman Sachs was declined a controlling role it then linked up with Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan to present themselves as alternative global co-ordinators of the share sale and requested a vote. When that vote failed, the three U.S. banks walked away. All three later tried to reopen negotiations but only J.P. Morgan was successful in securing an underwriting position, the source said. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. PLAYING HARDBALL Long-time advisor Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) ( BAC.N ) was appointed as global coordinator alongside Mediobanca ( MDBI.MI ), in which Unicredit owns an 8.7 percent stake, and Unicredit itself. BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, JP Morgan, Societe Generale and UBS as joint bookrunners have a lesser role, while ING, RBC, RBS and Santander are co-bookrunners. As the most senior role in a syndicate, global coordinators have the greatest say in running of the offering -- including, crucially, if and when to push ahead with it. But having Unicredit and Mediobanca in this position made the U.S. banks wary about how much say they would have, according to other sources close to the negotiations. One of those sources said the U.S. banks were uncomfortable about relying on risk assessments by banks that were very close to Unicredit. The three banks were also concerned about BoAML's long-standing ties with Unicredit through Italian lead banker Andrea Orcel, the sources added. The U.S. banks wanted to increase the financial protection in case the transaction didn't go through, the first source, close to Unicredit, said. Shares in Unicredit, which holds 40 billion euros of Italian government bonds, have lost half their value this year, leaving its fundraising worth around 50 percent of its market value, and making it painfully dilutive for investors. A rights issue by fellow Italian bank Banca Popolare di Milano ( PMII.MI ) last week fell 146 million euros short of its 800 million target, with investors taking up only 81.7 percent of the shares on offer. \"At the last minute they got hung up on a couple of legalistic issues and thought that given the situation is so uncertain they could get some concessions from Unicredit by playing hardball,\" said a separate source close to the deal . Such wrangling is not uncommon when companies are under pressure to raise capital. When Santander launched a 7.2 billion euro rights issue in 2008, at least one bank walked away at the last minute after baulking at the risk of underwriting the deal. And when Swiss insurer Zurich Financial Services ( ZURN.VX ) was under pressure to raise capital in 2002, one American bank threatened to pull out of the loss-making insurer's syndicate and tell the press the deal was too risky, in order to impose its conditions, the first source close to Unicredit said.

      "-- By  Huw Jones\n",
      "-- Fri Nov 25, 2011 6:12am EST\n",

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - A global accounting rule that was rehashed under pressure from policymakers in the financial crisis has to be revised, sparking industry fears it could make standard setters vulnerable again to political influence. \n",
      " In late 2009 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) revamped the first part of its \"fair value\" or mark-to-market rule which governs when and how banks in over 100 countries must price assets on their books at the going rate. Policymakers in the EU and elsewhere said at the time the existing rule forced banks to price assets at depressed values causing more volatility when markets were already fragile. IASB Chairman Hans Hoogervorst said on Friday the revamped IFRS 9 rule, which is likely to take effect in 2015, will be reworked even though countries like Australia already use it. In a speech in Melbourne, Australia, Hoogervorst said further changes would make IFRS 9 fit better with a separate reform of insurance accounting and help bridge a gap with a U.S. fair value accounting rule reform. World leaders want the IASB and its U.S. counterpart to \"converge\" their rules. \"We gradually came to the conclusion that we could make a lot of progress on both these issues -- insurance and convergence -- by adapting IFRS 9 in a limited way,\" Hoogervorst said. \"It was not an easy decision to make. Most importantly because we knew that our constituents that have already adopted might not be very happy,\" Hoogervorst added. The former Dutch finance minister, who took up the reins earlier this year, hoped for only limited tweaks but \"in practice pressure for wider changes will undoubtedly be there\". He promised to \"proceed with caution and limit any changes to those that are absolutely necessary.\" Ed Nusbaum, chief executive of auditor Grant Thornton, said the IASB should stick to market value assessments of bank assets. \"We want to make sure the IASB stays independent and the standards being set are not overly influenced by political influence to try to make banks and other institutions look better than they really are,\" Nusbaum told Reuters. REAL GREEK VALUE IFRS 9 will replace the IASB's current \"fair value\" rule known as IAS 39. Hoogervorst complained in August to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) that some banks in the EU were failing to apply the rule properly to avoid large writdowns on holdings of sovereign debt in Greece, which is receiving a second bail out from the EU. At the end of June markets were showing a 50 percent discount on Greek sovereign debt but French banks wrote down their holdings by much less than this while in Britain and Germany regulators insisted on full market value writedowns. \"It has been observed that there are differences regarding recognition or non-recognition of impairment losses,\" ESMA said on Friday in a study on Greek debt writedowns which named no banks or EU member states. Two financial institutions showed no impairment at all even though ESMA concluded \"there was objective evidence of impairment of Greek sovereign bonds as of 30 June 2011). \"Issuers should have provided indications on the facts and circumstances and the conditions that existed at that date in their reports,\" ESMA added. ESMA noted its study will be \"relevant\" for banks and auditors preparing full annual statements for 2011, due early next year. \"While one can always debate the percentage of the impairment, the first question was  it impaired and the accountants clearly said in an almost united way that it was indeed impaired,\" Grant Thornton's Nusbaum said. \"That is important going forward in looking at Greek debt but it's too early to make an assessment about Italy and others,\" Nusbaum said.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Troubles in the subprime mortgage sector could put Wall Street on edge this week just as investors look for key economic data, including the Consumer Price Index, to shore up the market's nascent recovery after its recent plunge. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Fanning concerns about the sector that lends to home buyers with poor credit is this last week's precipitous slide in the stock of New Century Financial Corp. NEW.N amid fears that the lender could file for bankruptcy protection. The subprime lender said on Thursday it had stopped accepting new loans. Even after saying it had lined up $265 million in funding, New Century disclosed it was negotiating for further relief. Investors worry that fallout from rising loan defaults in the subprime market could hurt consumer confidence as lenders tighten credit amid the housing slowdown. Wall Street keeps a close watch on the moods and habits of consumers because their spending is a key driver of U.S. economic growth and corporate profitability. \"The worst thing that could happen to any economy is the loss of confidence,\" said Med Yones, president of the International Institute of Management, an economic research and forecasting group in Las Vegas. He said the bursting of the real estate bubble and high consumer debt were a major worry and \"if people started to think there may be a lot of bankruptcies (in the subprime lending market), then you're going to see the stock market sell off.\" SUBPRIME TIME This week could give Wall Street more insight into the extent of the subprime lending woes as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N and Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N are due to kick off the quarterly earnings reporting season for big investment banks this week. Wall Street's big banks buy mortgages from lenders and package them into mortgage-backed bonds. \"The possibility of (New Century) declaring bankruptcy is certainly raised by what they said\" last week, said Michael James, senior trader of regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan, in Los Angeles. \"I think the potential fallout from what might happen with New Century over the weekend and its effect on the fixed-income market are certainly part of the\" worry, James added. On Friday, stocks finished mixed as concerns about the subprime mortgage market took a toll and curbed some of the optimism created by February's healthy jobs data. For the past week, all three U.S. stock indexes rose: The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 1.34 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  advanced 1.13 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 0.83 percent. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 broke a two-week losing streak. AN INFLATION SNAPSHOT Besides fretting about housing woes, investors will brace themselves this week for a barrage of economic data that could yield crucial clues about the health of the U.S. economy and the future direction of U.S. interest rates. The week's most closely watched report is likely to be the Consumer Price Index for February, due on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast an increase of 0.3 percent in February's overall CPI, after January's 0.2 percent gain. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, February's core CPI is seen up 0.2 percent. In January, it rose 0.3 percent. A preliminary look at March consumer sentiment will be provided on Friday by the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. The consumer sentiment index is forecast to dip to 90.0 in March from 91.3 in February. The Federal Reserve's February report on industrial production and capacity utilization is also on Friday's data menu. The Reuters poll forecast: Industrial production, up 0.2 percent after January's decline of 0.5 percent, and capacity utilization is pegged at 81.3 vs. 81.2 previously. On Thursday, Wall Street will get the U.S. Producer Price Index for February, which measures wholesale prices. The forecast: Overall PPI, up 0.5 percent in February, after January's 0.6 percent drop. Core PPI is forecast to rise 0.2 percent in February, matching January's gain. With inflation on Wall Street's mind, investors will still keep track of oil prices. On Friday, NYMEX April crude CLJ7 ended at $60.05 a barrel, down 2.6 percent for the week. On Tuesday, February retail sales are due. The Reuters poll showed economists forecast a gain of 0.3 percent in retail sales, both including and excluding auto sales. On Monday, Federal Reserve Board Governor Randall Kroszner is scheduled to speak on \"Inflation Dynamics\" at a conference for the National Association for Business Economics. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART Last week marked Wall Street's attempt to reverse a slide it suffered a week earlier, which began when China's main stock index suffered its biggest drop in a decade. Investors sold stocks as a dwindling appetite for risk and concerns about economic growth triggered a flight into safe-haven assets like government bonds, wiping out the stock market's 2007 gains. The rebound has been punctuated by rising volatility, raising doubt about its sustainability. But money managers and analysts said longer term, the stock market is still poised to rise this year as share valuations fall into line with expectations. \"Over time, you have to realize that the reason you get superior returns in the market is because you have to endure higher volatility. That's the price of admission,\" said Rafael Resendes, co-founder and president of The Applied Finance Group, a capital market research and consulting firm in Fresno, California. \"For the investors, I would say nothing has changed, except maybe you re-evaluate your asset-allocation scheme, maybe buy more on the dips,\" Resendes said. \"But for a trader, obviously, there's going to be a lot of opportunities that arise as the market readjusts and gets used to a world of higher volatility.\" And speaking of volatility, Friday marks the quarterly expiration and settlement of four different types of March futures and options contracts -- a convergence known as quadruple witching.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell wants to take newspaper publisher and broadcaster Tribune Co. TRB.N private in a transaction valued at about $13 billion, according to financial newspaper Barron's. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Citing a person familiar with the ongoing auction, Barron's reported in its latest edition that Zell would personally put in as much as $300 million toward his proposal and has commitments from lenders for all the debt required. Tribune was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Zell declined to comment. Crain's Chicago Business reported on March 1 that Zell has publicly acknowledged for the first time that he may make a bid to buy Tribune. Without providing details, Zell, speaking at a real estate industry event, confirmed that his plan involved creating an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and that the ownership would be \"a partnership between myself and the ESOP,\" Crain's reported. Zell's plan would hand majority control of the company to the ESOP in return for the company being able to use the tax deductions generation by the ESOP to sweeten the share price that Tribune could pay existing shareholders, according to Barron's. Barron's reported that Zell wants to become chairman of the surviving entity. Chicago-based Tribune is reviewing bids that include buying out the company and spinning off divisions as it tries to satisfy restive investors. It is expected to decide by the end of the month. Tribune has been mulling a management-led plan to restructure after bids from billionaires Eli Broad and Ron Burkle and entertainment mogul David Geffen failed to impress a special committee of Tribune's board evaluating its options. Tribune put itself up for sale after its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trust, proposed the company take itself private for about $7.6 billion, or $31.70 a share. Tribune shares closed up 62 cents, or 2 percent, at $30.55 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. According to a report last week in the Los Angeles Times, a Tribune paper, Zell is seen as a strong contender to buy the media company. Tribune owns daily papers in such cities as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as about two dozen television stations and the Chicago Cubs professional baseball team. On February 7, private equity firm Blackstone Group won a three-month bidding war to acquire top U.S. office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust, founded by Zell, for about $23 billion.\n",

      " Two months after a television host launched an online campaign to evict Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) from the former home of Chinese emperors, the seven-year-old store has had its logo removed but otherwise it's business as usual, the agency said. \"Starbucks must move out of the imperial palace immediately, and it can no longer be allowed to taint China's national culture,\" said Jiang Hongbin, who represents the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang at the National People's Congress (NPC), a rubber-stamp legislature that meets once a year. \"As long as it stays in the imperial palace, it poses a challenge to our traditional culture,\" said Jiang, who is president of Heilongjiang Chia Tai Co., a unit of Thai agricultural conglomerate CP Group. In response to the online boycott, the Palace Museum management had promised to seek a solution with Starbucks by the end of June, Xinhua said. The rent paid by Starbucks is used for maintenance of the palace, it added, citing museum managers. NPC delegates may suggest motions or proposals for legislation and government action, but these are rarely acted upon but can occasionally be incorporated into legislation. Other suggestions this year have included protecting under-sea archaeological finds, banning claims of state sponsorship in advertising, and making entrance to the Great Hall of the People free.\n",

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Orbis Investment Management Ltd. said that Citigroup's $10.8 billion bid for Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T is too low, joining a chorus of shareholders that separately control about 25 percent of the troubled Japanese brokerage's shares. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Orbis, Nikko's second-largest shareholder, said it believes Citigroup's offer of 1,350 yen ($11.41) per share is about two-thirds what the shares are really worth. \"Orbis considers the proposed Citigroup offer unacceptable,\" the firm said in a statement released late Saturday. Investors hoping for a better deal have kept Nikko's shares above Citigroup's offer price since the U.S. banking group unveiled its bid last Tuesday. Nikko's shares rose 3 percent to 1,410 yen on Friday. Three other major shareholders have also objected to the bid price. They include Canadian investment group Mackenzie Financial Corp., Tennessee-based Southeastern Asset Management, and Chicago-based Harris Associates. Orbis values Nikko at 2,000 yen a share, a figure also put forth by Harris and Southeastern. Mackenzie believes Nikko is worth 1,700-1,800 yen a share, Japan's Nikkei business daily reported on Sunday. The report said the head of Mackenzie's Japanese office met with Nikko Cordial President Shoji Kuwashima on Friday to relay their lack of support. Some analysts, though, have said shareholders may choose to sell rather than risk Citigroup walking away at a difficult time for Nikko. Nikko, the third-largest Japanese brokerage, risks losing its stock listing over an accounting scandal at its merchant banking arm. It has admitted to forging documents and booking about $300 million in excess profit over two years. Citi, which already owned 4.9 percent of Nikko, said it plans to boost the brokerage's revenues through such measures as combining Citigroup retail banking and credit card businesses with Nikko's retail brokerage business. Orbis said it holds about 67.5 million Nikko shares, or 6.9 percent of the outstanding stock, which according to Reuters data would make it the second largest shareholder after Harris. Harris owns about 7.5 percent of Nikko shares, while Southeastern owns a roughly 6.6 pct stake. Mackenzie owns a 5.74 percent stake, according to a January regulatory filing.\n",

      "\n",
      " \"Do you think it's fine that a CD plays in all CD players but that an iTunes song only plays in an iPod? I don't. Something has to change,\" EU Consumer Protection Commissioner Kuneva was quoted as saying in a preview of an interview to be published on Monday. Apple could not be immediately reached for comment on the report. Norway, a European country that is not in the EU, is battling Apple for the same reason. In January, it said the computer and software giant must liberalize its music download system by October 1 or face legal action. Pressure on Apple has been building, with consumer rights organizations from Germany, France, Finland and Norway recently agreeing a joint position in their battles against iTunes. They argue that Apple uses digital rights technology to limit consumers' free use of songs bought on iTunes, including the ability to copy and transfer songs to other users and other MP3 devices besides the Apple iPod. Both at the national and EU levels, however, the issue has been looked at by consumer agencies rather than the competition watchdogs whose role it is to decide whether a business activity violates rules on fair competition. A Commission spokeswoman in Brussels confirmed Kuneva's comment reported by the magazine but said it represented the commissioner's personal views, not those of the Commission. \"I don't think she was stating it as a definitive policy position. At this stage it is her gut instinct,\" spokeswoman Helen Kearns said. Kuneva is leading a review of the eight basic laws which govern cross-border consumer rights. That review, which has just begun and has so far resulted in a preliminary document raising questions, will eventually lead to proposed revisions of current EU laws, the spokeswoman said.

      " MANAMA  (Reuters) - Halliburton Co., the U.S. oilfield service giant, said on Sunday its chief executive plans to open a corporate headquarters in the United Arab Emirates in an effort to expand business in the Eastern Hemisphere. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \"My office will be in Dubai, and I will run our entire worldwide operations from that office,\" Halliburton chief executive David Lesar said at an energy conference in Bahrain. \"Dubai is a great business center.\" The company said it will maintain its global headquarters in Houston, where the company is currently based. An analyst said the move made sense. \"The company as a whole has continued to diversify internationally, and the Middle East is a point that they have targeted,\" said William Sanchez, a U.S.-based analyst at Howard Weil Inc. \"They are being opportunistic in putting the CEO in the middle of the action.\" During 2006, more than 38 percent of Halliburton's $13 billion in oil services revenue was generated in the Eastern Hemisphere. Sanchez said he believed Halliburton's move to Dubai is not tax related. Instead he views it as a strategic play. Lesar said Halliburton is considering listing its shares on one of the Middle East bourses as it looks at growth potential in the hemisphere. \"One of the things that we would like to pursue ... is a listing of our shares in the Middle East,\" Lesar said on the sidelines of the event. Halliburton has not yet decided in which country it would list its shares. \"At this point in time we clearly see there are greater opportunities in the Eastern Hemisphere than the Western Hemisphere,\" he told reporters. GROWTH Halliburton would spend a large part of its $1.4 billion investment budget for the year in the Middle East, he said. Oil and gas service companies have hiked prices for their services over the past two years as the sector strains to bring enough capacity on line to meet rapidly rising demand. Many new supply projects are in the oil-producing countries of the Middle East, while Asia accounts for most of the rising demand. In contrast, a slide in natural gas prices in the United States has prompted investor concern that oil and gas companies might cut back on spending in North America. Halliburton has long been involved in the Middle East energy sector. KBR Inc., the engineering and military-services contractor unit that Halliburton is in the process of splitting off, is the Pentagon's largest contractor in Iraq. The company has faced several investigations into alleged overbilling there, as well as for its links to Iran, where U.S. companies are forbidden from operating. Vice President Dick Cheney was head of the company from 1995-2000. Lesar also said he expected the price of oil to stay above $40 a barrel, providing good conditions for future investment in the oil and gas industry.\n",

      " ShoreBank, a privately owned bank known for its philanthropic activities, had received multi-million dollar investment commitments in recent months from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America, as well as from General Electric. But the bank, which was put on the ropes when the recession hit its lower-income borrowers especially hard, was unable to secure the funds it was seeking from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, it needed to match private-sector pledges. ShoreBank's deposits will be taken over by a newly chartered institution called Urban Partnership Bank (UPB). Its 15 branches also will shift to the new bank. William Farrow, a former banker with First Chicago Corp, will be president and chief executive of UPB and David Vitale, former executive chairman of ShoreBank, will be chairman. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said ShoreBank had $2.16 billion in assets and $1.54 billion in deposits as of June 30. The FDIC estimated that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of the failure will be $367.7 million. \"Compared to other alternatives, Urban Partnership Bank's acquisition was the least costly resolution,\" the FDIC said in a statement. Urban Partnership Bank will pay the FDIC a premium of 0.50 percent to assume all of the deposits of ShoreBank and in addition will purchase \"essentially all of the assets except for the marketable securities and fixed assets,\" the agency said. The FDIC and Urban Partnership Bank also entered into a loss-share transaction covering $1.41 billion of ShoreBank's assets. UPB will have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 percent and sufficient capital to meet pre-opening expenses, projected growth and overall capital needs, UPB said in a statement. The new bank was \"capitalized by financial institutions, philanthropic organizations and socially responsible individuals from Chicago and nationally,\" it said. ShoreBank is one of the larger banks to fail in recent months and the 114th FDIC-insured institution shut down so far this year. Seven other U.S. banks closed on Friday in Virginia, California and Florida as the community bank sector continues to struggle with poorly performing loans and recovers at a pace that lags behind that of Wall Street and the larger economy. Los Padres Bank, Solvang, California, Independent National Bank, Ocala, Florida and Imperial Savings and Loan Association, Martinsville, Virginia, were among the banks that were closed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said. Small banks are collapsing at a faster pace this year compared to last, but regulators expect the closures to peak this quarter. Attempts to rescue ShoreBank have played out in the media for months, with lawmakers and watchdogs questioning whether special treatment was being given to the bank. ShoreBank is located on Chicago's South Side near the home base of President Barack Obama and some of his top aides, and the bank has promoted on its website connections to Obama. ShoreBank has received national recognition over the years for its efforts to extend loans to low-income communities and environmental cause. It has some prominent supporters with strong ties to Washington, including Ellen Seidman, former director of the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision, and Eugene Ludwig, former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who represents Chicago's North Side, lobbied Wall Street banks this year to save the 37-year-old bank. She has blamed Wall Street's \"recklessness\" for the foreclosure crisis that precipitated ShoreBank's losses. But bank activity with a philanthropic bent has not been profitable lately. For the quarter ending March 31, ShoreBank reported a $17.1 million operating loss, compared with an operating profit of $384,000 in the year-earlier period. UPB \"will focus on providing continued availability of financial services for low and moderate income communities\" in Chicago, Cleveland and Detroit, the bank said. \"The private investment in this new financial institution demonstrates commitment to restoring the economic vitality of our communities,\" Vitale said in a statement.\n"

      "-- Court bars AU CEO from leaving U.S. in LCD probe\n",

      " SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The CEO of the world's fourth-largest maker of liquid crystal displays has been barred by a federal judge from leaving the United States as Justice Department officials pursue price-fixing allegations against the company. \n",
      "\n",
      " A grand jury indicted Lai-Juh Chen, chief executive officer of Taiwan's AU Optronics Corp ( 2409.TW ) ( AUO.N ), in June for fixing prices of thin-film LCD panels, which go into everything from TVs to smartphones. The court ordered him to surrender his passport this week. The U.S. Justice Department has accused AU Optronics executives of participating in a group of industry officials who met regularly in Taipei hotel rooms and restaurants to discuss and agree on prices, from 2001 to 2006. Six companies had pleaded guilty in the subsequent probe, including Taiwan's Chi Mei ( 3481.TW ) and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd ( 2475.TW ), South Korea's LG Display ( 034220.KS ) Co Ltd, and Japan's Sharp Corp ( 6753.T ), Epson Imaging Devices, and Hitachi Displays. After Chen pleaded not guilty in San Francisco last month, his lawyers argued that as the case proceeds, he should be allowed to travel between the United States and Asia to attend important meetings. \"One such meeting is scheduled in September with top officials of customer LG Electronics ( 066570.KS ) in Korea,\" his lawyers wrote. \"If Dr. Chen was unable to personally attend these meetings as CEO, it would be more difficult for AU to conclude agreement with customers or, potentially, it could risk losing substantial business to competitors.\" In Taiwan, an AU Optronics publicist said the firm's business would see little impact from the case as many of Chen's senior deputies remain on the island. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered Chen and AU's vice chairman, Hsuan Bin Chen, to surrender their passports this week, court records indicate. \"Defendants shall not travel outside the Northern District of California\" without the court's permission, Illston wrote. The district stretches from San Jose in California north to the Oregon border, and includes San Francisco. However, Illston quickly approved Chen's request to take a brief domestic trip to Atlanta and Tennessee. WEB WIDENS Prosecutors obtained indictments against four other current and former AU officials, along with the company itself. Another one of those executives now barred from leaving the United States is Hui Hsiung, CEO of Qisda Corp, a Taiwanese manufacturer of electronics components including LCD monitors. A handful of representatives from the Taiwan government attended Hsiung's court hearing to show support for his international travel request, his attorney Brian Berson said. But prosecutors argued that Hsiung and the other AU executives were flight risks, given the lack of an extradition treaty between the United States and Taiwan. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei, capital of self-ruled Taiwan, to Beijing in 1979. Hsiung was disappointed with Illston's ruling, which may force him to resign from Qisda, his lawyer said. So far, 17 executives have been charged in the LCD probe, and the six companies that have pleaded guilty have paid fines totaling more than $860 million. Many executives have pleaded guilty, and their prison sentences usually last a few months. The AU personnel appear to be the first to declare their innocence and fight the charges. AU said in July it saw no material impact on company operations from the indictment, and, denying the charges, pointed out that prices for thin-film LCD panels had fallen steeply in past years. A U.S. lawyer for AU Optronics, a major supplier to the likes of Dell Inc DELL.O, Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ) and Sony Corp ( 6758.T ), declined comment on Friday.

      " BERLIN  (Reuters) - Regional German governments and  politicians from Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition parties are joining protests against planned austerity measures, media reported on Saturday. \n",
      "\n",
      " A day after German industry launched a concerted attack on Merkel over her proposal for a tax on nuclear power providers, Der Spiegel said that regional governments were planning a joint protest against cuts in funding for urban development. Construction ministers from states governed by Merkel's conservatives as well as those led by the opposition Social Democrats aim to resist cuts worth 2.4 billion euros ($3.1 billion), the weekly news magazine said. These measures would lead to a halt in investment and threaten jobs and tax revenues, the magazine cited a working paper of the ministers as saying. Merkel's center-right government has agreed a four-year, 80 billion euro austerity plan to slash the budget deficit. This push has drawn criticism from politicians at home and from some of Germany's euro zone partners, who say it is unwise to withdraw fiscal stimulus from an economy still recovering from its deepest post-war recession. Although support for the budget cuts has plunged in recent weeks, the government is sticking to its guns and plans to lay out details on implementation at the start of September. Energy policy is a particular area of contention at a time that the cabinet is also preparing to unveil its long-term energy plans. Industry bosses and members of Merkel's own Christian Democrats (CDU) urged her in an open letter on Friday to drop her plan to tax nuclear power providers, saying it would put Germany's future at risk. Michael Fuchs, a deputy head of the CDU in the lower house of parliament, has also urged the government not to pursue its plan to reduce tax breaks for large corporate energy consumers. \"We cannot push energy-intensive companies away from this country with the environmental tax,\" he told Der Spiegel. TAX RELIEF? Germany's robust recovery also has prompted the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), junior coalition partners in Merkel's center-right government, to reiterate calls for tax relief for middle-income earners. \"We can get rid of the solidarity tax (for investment in former East Germany) and relieve citizens by 12 billion euros without threatening the consolidation of state finances,\" FDP finance expert Frank Schaeffler was cited as saying in Wirtschaftswoche magazine on Saturday. The German economy grew at the fastest rate since reunification in the second quarter as companies stepped up investment and exports surged. The FDP had campaigned on a ticket of tax relief, yet Merkel put aside the idea during the euro zone debt crisis and has said she still sees no scope for tax cuts over the next two years. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has also made it clear that consolidation remains the fiscal priority and on Saturday also lowered hopes for a broad simplification of the tax system. \"Many proposals for tax simplifications cannot be carried out without causing a considerable shortfall,\" Schaeuble was cited as saying by Der Spiegel.

      " The NUM was demanding a 10 percent pay rise across the board and 1,700 rand ($233) in housing allowance for its members. Implats, the world's second-largest platinum producer, offered a 7.5 percent pay rise for workers in the high income bracket and 8 percent for those in the lower category, which the union accepted. \"We have just signed an agreement. There will be no strike,\" Eddie Majadibodu, the NUM's chief negotiator at Impala Platinum, told Reuters. The union and Implats also reached a deal for a 1,700 rand home ownership allowance and 1,200 rand living-out allowance for workers who do not live in the company's hostels. But the parties could not agree on pension contributions, and the union will take the matter to arbitration, said Majadibodu. Implats management and the NUM have been in talks for more than three weeks to end the deadlock and avoid a strike. Africa's biggest economy has been hit by a wave of strikes and strike threats in both the private and public sector, which have led to above-inflation settlements and stoked fears that the cost of living will rise. South Africa's inflation rate slowed to 4.2 percent in June. Implats had said it expected lower full-year profit due to an increase in share-based expenses.

      " MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's central bank governor Raghuram Rajan may raise policy rates again after shocking markets by increasing them in only his first meeting, signaling he is willing to risk prolonging what is already the lowest economic growth in years in order to quash persistent inflation. \n",
      " Raising the repo rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent as India stumbles through its worst economic crisis since 1991 puts pressure on New Delhi to relieve supply-side bottlenecks in the economy, such as poor infrastructure, that keep inflation high even when demand is soft. That is a big ask for a weak coalition government, which also faces a general election by May. Rajan is expected by many in the market to shift the RBI's main inflation gauge to consumer prices from wholesale prices, putting India in line with most big economies but pushing up near-term rate expectations. Consumer price inflation was 9.5 percent for August, meaning the cost of living is rising faster than interest rates. The wholesale price index rose 6.1 percent. \"If he goes ahead and hikes further, which I think he might, then it might affect growth. But ultimately, if you have to bring down inflation, there is no other option,\" said A. Prasanna, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd in Mumbai. A prominent former IMF chief economist who famously predicted the global financial crisis, Rajan took office earlier this month amid much media fanfare and high expectations that he could engineer a turnaround for the sluggish economy and rescue a currency that had fallen as much as 20 percent this year. A flurry of measures by Rajan's predecessor and fresh moves on his first day in office have helped lift the rupee off its record low. Rajan rolled back part of the sharp increase in the marginal standing facility (MSF), an overnight rate, reassuring some in financial markets that the rupee measures are temporary. But in raising the repo rate, traditionally the policy interest rate, Rajan showed the central bank's priority had shifted from defending the rupee to fighting inflation. \"It should bring down inflation expectations and help correct India's macroeconomic imbalances. However, this means severe growth pain in the coming year,\" Nomura analysts wrote. Nomura now expects the RBI to raise the repo rate by another 50 bps in the fiscal year ending in March to take it to 8.00 percent, followed by a lengthy pause. It had previously expected no further rate move this fiscal year followed by 75 bps of cuts in the next fiscal year. It also said there are downward risks to its GDP forecast of 4.2 percent, which would be the lowest in a decade, and 5.1 percent for this fiscal year and next, respectively. Edelweiss Securities, which had expected 50 bps of rate cuts by the end of March, now expects rates to stay unchanged. 'INTERESTING EXPERIMENT' While the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday not to begin unwinding its monetary stimulus fuelled expectations that the RBI would begin cutting the MSF back to its earlier level, not a single analyst in a Reuters poll had predicted that Rajan would increase the repo rate. Lifting rates may compel Indian households to shift more of their savings towards banks and away from real estate and gold, addressing a trend that has pushed down deposit growth. \"I think it's an interesting experiment,\" said Rahul Bajoria, an economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. \"I am not saying whether I know it will work or not, but I think it sort of shows the RBI's hand in the sense that they really want to focus more on the inflation side of things than on growth at this point,\" he said. Also, one of the biggest drivers of inflation in India, the rising cost of food, is generally not sensitive to rates, meaning the net effect of Rajan's policy tightening may be on managing inflation expectations as much as inflation itself. If Rajan raises rates further, he might not do so dramatically. On Friday, he noted that a weak economy can provide a \"cushion in terms of disinflationary processes at work but also will give us an incentive to then perhaps look to putting greater emphasis on reviving the growth of the economy.\" India grew at 4.4 percent in the June quarter, its worst pace in four years. NOT LOOKING FOR 'LIKES' Indian markets took the policy badly, with bonds and stocks plunging and dragging the rupee down with them only a day after a Fed-fuelled rally. Still, in recent weeks the rupee has recovered some of its losses and the sense of crisis surrounding the currency has eased for now. Traders said the 10-year government bond yield - which jumped 39 basis points on Friday - could rise close to 20 basis points this week, partly as the market factors in higher policy rates. Some Indian companies worried the higher rates could prove damaging. Many companies are struggling after the central bank's rupee measures supported the currency but dried up credit. \"Industry is truly concerned about the policy rate hikes and their adverse impact on the investment sentiment,\" Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd ( SREI.NS ) said in a statement. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, who has in the past pushed for pro-growth monetary policy, did not make any public comment on Friday, although several ministry insiders said they were understanding of the challenge Rajan faces. At his first-day press conference earlier this month, Rajan, 50, impressed RBI-watchers with a multi-pronged action plan to bolster the rupee and strengthen financial markets but also warned that he would have to make unpopular decisions, that his job was not to accumulate \"likes\" on Facebook. \"This is possibly the part where the new RBI governor pre-empted that the course of action by the central bank was not to accumulate \"likes\", said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS in Singapore.

      " Hitting a primary budget surplus, before interest payments, is key for Greece because it would trigger a clause in its EU/IMF bailout allowing it to seek further debt relief from its lenders. \"I think we are close to converging on a common, realistic estimate that there will be a small, viable primary budget surplus this year,\" the official said on condition of anonymity, after the first meeting in the latest review of Greece's bailout by its lenders. \"There are four or five budget items on which we still have to fully agree,\" the official added.

Athens and its lenders are also very close to agreeing on a joint economic growth forecast for 2013 and 2014, the official said, without revealing the estimates. Athens said on Thursday that it expected its economy to shrink by 3.8 percent this year, less than a previous estimate of 4.2 percent.

      " STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Despite the rapid pace of technology that has overhauled many consumer goods, the front door lock and key is little changed since the 1800s. That is about to change - to virtual keys in data clouds, if the world's biggest lockmaker gets its way. \n",
      " Assa Abloy, which makes one in ten locks worldwide, is the muscle behind brands such as Yale. But the lock technology it is now developing means consumers will be able to open doors with a tap of their mobile phones, visitors will be able to download a key online and business owners will be able to lock and unlock their premises remotely. \"I think most people will go digital. People will rely more on a secure identity than a physical key, provided over the net into your mobile phone,\" says Johan Molin, Assa Abloy's lean 54-year-old chief executive. Electro-mechanical locks like key cards in hotels now account for almost half of Assa Abloy's sales compared with 13 percent a decade ago, and the company believes this is just the start of growing demand from consumers for more flexible, high-tech locking mechanisms. At its Stockholm headquarters, some of Assa Abloy's staff are trialing different versions of virtual keys downloaded to mobile phones that open a lock simply with a swipe of the phone. The company is also working up versions where phones with bluetooth or wireless links could automatically open doors when within a certain distance. Other keys can be set to switch on at a certain date and expire on another date, meaning someone renting a flat, for example, need no longer hand over physical keys at the end of their stay. The digital keys can be embedded in SIM cards, within software or inside the phone itself, thanks to Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, or short range wireless that within a few years may be standard in most mobile devices. U.S. research firm ABI Research has estimated that the number of NFC enabled devices will exceed 500 million in 2014. The new key technology could also unlock higher recurring revenues. While traditional locks last on average four decades, electro-mechanical locks have lifespans of 10-15 years and software coupled with more fickle consumer electronics means these locks will need to be routinely replaced or updated. It is a model Assa is confident that consumers used to frequently upgrading their phones and tablets will accept. \"People will have the same kind of relationship to their lock that they have to their computer. They will want to have the latest features, designs,\" Molin said. Just this week Apple launched its new iPhone 5S, with a fingerprint scanner, replacing the need for passwords and PIN numbers with biometric security. DRIVING CHANGE But selling locks is a delicate business and the market traditionally conservative. Some consumers, especially in Europe, are reluctant to move from the security of physical keys to a more opaque system, particularly amid worries about cybersecurity. Additionally the cost involved - a digital Yale lock is about 30 percent more expensive than a traditional one - currently limits the technology to high-end households. So Assa Abloy's strategy is to make the technology a good fit with businesses and institutions like hotels, hospitals and schools, which account for three quarters of its sales, in order to 'normalize' the new product, lower costs and ultimately drive broader consumer acceptance. With this in mind the company has boosted research and development spending 129 percent since 2005 and in 2012 spent about $210 million, or 2.9 percent of sales, on R&D. That 2.9 percent is around the industry average for R&D spending, analysts say, as Assa's U.S. rivals in particular, Ingersoll-Rand and Stanley Black & Decker chase the same new markets. \"The challenge for Assa Abloy is to move fast enough,\" said Carlo Pompili, CEO of Swedish startup firm Telcred which is working on new locking technology. \"It's a huge market with many nuances. They cannot think of everything. That opens up space for other companies.\" Alongside its own technological research Assa Abloy says it will continue to do deals that advance its products. \"We of course try and focus on our own innovation,\" says Daniel Berg, vice-president of Assa Abloy mobile keys. \"But complementary acquisitions could happen if there is a start-up with a great idea.\" The company has a long history of buying up competitors. More than ten years ago it bought U.S. firm HID, an early secure ID card producer, giving it a big advantage in a market providing secure computer access that subsequently boomed. It then bought up U.S.-based ActivID in 2010, adding a layer of more sophisticated digital identity recognition to that product line. With an eye on its current direction, Assa Abloy reached a deal in 2012 with Oberthur, a leading manufacturer of SIM cards, allowing it to embed its digital keys in Oberthur's cards. A consumer buying Oberthur's product need only then buy an App to get access to Assa Abloy's key code. There are newer and smaller competitors pushing forward in this area, like U.S.-based Lockitron, which makes devices to lock and unlock deadbolts via remote control, or Spain's Salto, making lock software tailored to businesses. But in a still-developing market few can compete with Assa Abloy's reach. \"High-tech locks, using phones, etc, are the future, but the question is how fast it will grow?\" said Oscar Stjerngren, an analyst at Danske Bank. \"Assa Abloy are so dominant globally they can drive this transition in the high-tech lock market.\" OLD & NEW Global reach means catering to a rich mix of national nuances that in turn require a combination of products - so Assa Abloy is not turning its back on traditional security just yet. North American consumers still spend twice as much on \"emergency exit devices\" such as fire escape doors than Europeans. Northern Europeans spend three to four times as much on high security household locks than North Americans. \"In America it's all about getting out. In Europe it is all about avoiding people getting in,\" Molin said. The company's most recent buy was more traditional hardware - in September it acquired the firedoors business of Polish-based Mercor to give it access to growing markets in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is also planning acquisitions of hardware manufacturers and traditional locksmiths in China, South America and India, though demand for digital locks is growing fast in the first two of those markets. Demand for high-tech security is particularly strong in Brazil, where violent crime is common. Not only is fingerprinting identification for cash withdrawal machines becoming popular, but banks and consumers are requesting an extra layer of security that allows the machines to analyze blood vessels in the finger to recognize whether the person to whom it belongs is alive or dead.

      " BANGKOK  (Reuters) - An incentive program for first-time car buyers in Thailand has backfired with more than 100,000 indebted consumers defaulting, leaving the big global manufacturers that dominate Southeast Asia's largest auto market struggling to defend their margins. \n",
      " The tax breaks, which the World Bank estimates cost Thailand $2.5 billion, were intended to revive auto manufacturing in the region's biggest car-making hub following devastating floods in 2011. But much like the U.S. \"cash for clunkers\" program in 2009, the incentives distorted the market, creating a boom in demand that collapsed once the tax breaks expired in December. Research from IHS Global Automotive shows around 10 percent of the 1.2 million Thais who signed on to the incentive scheme have either changed their minds or couldn't pay monthly installments. Japanese automakers, who control 80 percent of the local market, reported a 30 percent drop in sales on average in the second quarter of 2013. Once buyers canceled, the vehicles were seized by auto finance companies and sold as used cars. \"Our prices have plummeted. On average they've fallen 20 percent this year,\" said Narongrod Chataratipa, general manager of Center Used Car which operates two showrooms in Bangkok. \"Some smaller dealers struggled to survive and shut down. Now that people realize they can't afford to pay, their barely used cars are on the market, driving down prices even further.\" MARKET GLUT The glut of almost-new vehicles hitting the market has had a knock-on effect of automakers, who are being forced to offer promotions or discounts to move stock. Mitsubishi Motors MMOTH.UL ( 7211.T ), which operates three vehicle plants in the kingdom, said April-to-June Thai sales dropped 24 percent year-on-year to around 20,800 vehicles and it expects further falls. \"The end of the incentives scheme created an irregularity which may trade off the benefits to some extent. We've come to see it as an unavoidable cost of the program,\" said Nobuyuki Murahashi, President of Mitsubishi Motors (Thailand). Mitsubishi, Thailand's largest exporter of cars, has launched sales promotions around the country, including lucky draws and a no-interest payment scheme spread over 48 months. U.S. brands like Chevrolet and Ford ( F.N ) have a much smaller share of the Thai market, although they have made advances in recent years. Laurent Berthet, director of communications in Southeast Asia for Chevrolet-maker General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), said the market had been struggling over the last three months. \"Of course, it implies everybody must be extremely cautious,\" he said. \"It obliges us to work closely with our dealers to get new models out there and attract interest from our customers.\" Often referred to as the \"Detroit of Southeast Asia\", auto manufacturing is Thailand's third-largest industry and accounts for 12 percent of gross domestic product. Car production surged 70 percent in 2012 from the previous year's flood-constrained output, to 2.43 million vehicles, according to the Paris-based International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. This year it is expected to exceed 2.5 million vehicles, but with domestic demand falling automakers will need to ship more to export markets in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia. \"FINANCIAL SUICIDE\" Nitipon Chamnansilp, a 28-year-old graphic designer, signed on to the incentive plan that offered a tax refund of up to 100,000 baht ($3,200). His computer screen saver still shows his dream car: a modest Honda. \"I knew exactly which car I wanted and paid a booking deposit,\" said Nitipon. \"But living costs have gone up since then and I already have monthly installments to pay for my apartment. Adding another payment would be financial suicide.\" Thailand's household debt is equivalent to nearly 80 percent of gross domestic product, among the highest in Asia. Last month the central bank expressed concerns over the impact of potential defaults in auto loans that could \"adversely affect prices of second-hand cars and potentially lenders\". Critics have compared the car scheme to other populist policies of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government including a rice buying scheme to aid farmers that has cost at least $4.46 billion since it was introduced in 2011. \"The tax refund scheme not only distorted the auto market, it also used the national budget to compensate losses from excise tax,\" said Jessada Thongpak, a Bangkok-based senior analyst at IHS Automotive. Supporters say the plan gave a much-needed boost to the big Japanese manufacturers - domestic sales of passenger cars more than doubled year-on-year in 2012, according the Thai Automotive Institute. \"There will be payment defaults and we might have a trough but overall it was good that the government did this scheme because the industry came to its absolute capacity limit,\" said Uli Kaiser, president of industry analysts the Automotive Focus Group Thailand. \"Never had Thailand produced so many cars.\" Although sales have dropped for four consecutive months, they are still running well ahead of the 700,000 units sold in 2010, the year before the plan was launched. GREEN FUTURE Undaunted by the mixed results of the first incentive scheme, the Thai government is pressing ahead with phase two of a green car program that offers tax breaks to manufacturers of environmentally-friendly and compact vehicles. The scheme's first phase saw auto giants Suzuki Motor Corp ( 7269.T ), Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ), Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) and Mitsubishi join, and its second phase has attracted interest from European car makers such as Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ). Thailand's Board of Investment, a government agency that promotes local and foreign investment, estimates that the country will produce 700,000 eco-cars by 2015. Research from IHS shows domestic demand for such vehicles is already trailing production by half, suggesting automakers may once again be stuck with unwanted supplies. Those green cars may find their way into Southeast Asian neighbor Indonesia, which boasts a potential car market - based on population - almost four times the size of Thailand's but just half the auto manufacturing capacity. Kaiser, from the Automotive Focus Group, said Thailand remained vital to Japanese automakers as a regional export base. \"The Japanese have strong interests in playing down the growth perspectives of Southeast Asia because they have a lot to lose. It is the only place, apart from South Korea and Japan, where the Europeans play no significant role,\" said Kaiser. \"What Mexico is for the U.S, Thailand is for the Japanese. Thailand is their Mexico.\" ($1 = 31.7300 Thai baht) (Additional reporting by Pairat Temphairojana in Bangkok and  Yoko Kubota  in Tokyo; Editing by  Emily Kaiser  and  Alex Richardson )\n",

      " The departure of Saccomanni, a former high ranking Bank of Italy official who is not affiliated to a political party, would be a blow to Italy's credibility with financial markets as it battles to emerge from its longest recession in six decades. Italy's accounts are heading toward overshooting the EU deficit limit this year, Saccomanni said on Friday, just months after the country was taken off a black list for running excessive budget gaps in the past. While the minister said he would do all it takes to keep the deficit below the 3 percent of output ceiling, senior coalition members have pledged to go ahead with tax cuts amid a growing sense that a national election may be just a few months away. \"Promises must be kept, otherwise I'm not staying,\" Saccomanni was quoting saying in an interview with Corriere. \"I must defend my credibility, and I have no political ambitions.\" Prime Minister Enrico Letta's government has been in near constant turmoil since it was formed five months ago by the country's two biggest parties, traditionally bitter rivals. Letta's Democratic Party (PD) and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI) agreed to govern together after an inconclusive national vote in February, but both sides appear to be mulling an early vote as a way out of the awkward alliance. \"I'm not going to make a desperate search for a billion euros if in February there's going to be a vote,\" Saccomanni was said to say in the Corriere, explaining that reforms and the management of the public accounts required political stability. To meet the EU deficit target, Saccomanni needs 1.4 billion euros and he indicated a one-percentage-point increase of the main sales-tax rate of 21 percent scheduled for October 1 cannot be cancelled without worsening the public accounts. The economic policy impasse comes at an especially bad moment for the coalition. Berlusconi is reeling from a definitive conviction for tax fraud last month and an impending vote to strip him of his Senate seat, and the PD is torn by an internal power struggle between Letta and Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi, with a primary vote to pick a new leader set for December 8. Letta is travelling to the United States and Canada this week, but will return Friday to preside over a cabinet meeting where a decision over the sales-tax increase must be taken. SLOGANS AND PROPAGANDA Saccomanni toned down his threat later on Sunday in comments from the sidelines of a conference in Tuscany. \"The moment has come to have a calm and serious debate over the public accounts,\" Saccomanni said in comments broadcast by SkyTG24. \"Italians deserve to know exactly how things stand instead of hearing only slogans and propaganda.\" Letta fully supports his Economy Minister, a source in the prime minister's office said. \"We will not continue to be part of a coalition whose government wants to raise taxes on Italians,\" Daniela Santanche, an influential lawmaker close to Berlusconi who favors an early vote, said on Sunday, urging the minister to step down. But Renato Brunetta, FI's group leader in the lower house, was conciliatory after having repeatedly said in recent weeks the survival of the government depended on the cancellation of the value-added tax (VAT) hike. In an interview broadcast on state TV, Brunetta said he did not want Saccomanni to resign and that he was confident the VAT increase would be averted. Deputy Economy Minister Stefano Fassina of the PD warned an early vote would be \"irresponsible\", but he said funding could be found to head off the sales-tax increase. It would cost about 1 billion euros to cancel the sales-tax hike, but another newspaper, Il Messaggero, estimated on Sunday that Saccomanni needed a total of 6 billion euros by the end of the year to meet the deficit target while funding other promised measures, including the country's military missions abroad.

      " The Mines Ministry pleaded to a handful of local and foreign firms to bid on a near billion dollar cement tender, luring interest with attractive terms like free currency conversions and 100 percent capital repatriation. Hopes are pinned on Afghanistan's trillion dollar wealth in resources weaning the country off international aid, but early attempts to unlock its potential have hit serious setbacks. These appeared to have deterred major international firms from attending - leaving the path open to small investors with unconventional backgrounds, prepared to take on deteriorating security and uncertainty ahead of next year's election. Afghanistan has been at war for decades. It is now trying to inject life into attempts to negotiate an end to an Islamist Taliban insurgency as most NATO combat troops prepare to pull out by the end of 2014, leaving the country to handle its own security. \"Too many big international companies are too afraid about what is going to happen after 2014,\"said Tom Watts, a director at SJH Group and former British paratrooper who served in Iraq. \"They're sat on their backfoot waiting to see what happens... Let's bring it on, all three concessions, let's have them all.\" To reassure potential suitors, Mines Minister Wahidullah Shahrani announced the opening of the near billion dollar cement tender and also marked the publication of first official guide to investment in Afghanistan. \"This information will be sufficient to give first-hand information on whatever an investor requires to make the decision to come to Afghanistan,\" Shahrani said. Sharani said international experts had been called in to ensure the terms would be favorable to investors. Nodding to fears about corruption in a country that routinely ranks among the most corrupt in the world, the minister promised the tender would be conducted in a \"very transparent and clean manner\". Afghanistan's unruly territory holds large deposits of gold, copper, iron ore and oil, as well as lithium and rare earths used in high-tech manufacturing. Chinese firms have scrambled to access its wealth but both of the country's most important ventures are at a standstill. In Amu Darya, oil production has stopped because there is no deal in place to refine it. At Mes Aynak, the Chinese consortium has  demanded a review of a landmark $3 billion deal to produce copper in Afghanistan. Afghanistan imports virtually all of its cement at the cost of around $1 billion a year, making it the second largest drain on its cash after fuel. If the three cement plants tendered start up as hoped over the next few years, they could eventually supply all of the country's needs, according to officials at the event. A second prospective investor, an Afghan doctor turned business manager, said he was also undeterred by the Chinese troubles. \"Cement is a very good investment, demand is high and there are a lot of new projects,\" said Dr Mohammad Shafiq, a senior manager for a group of companies including Griffin Ltd, based in Yemen.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - A clutch of surveys this week is likely to show the global economy slowly picking up even as new and old uncertainties combine to test the optimism of businesses and consumers alike. \n",
      " Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) for the euro zone, China and the United States are all forecast to climb further away from the boom-bust line of 50. Germany's closely watched IFO business sentiment index is also expected to show a gain. Gross domestic product in the euro zone remains 3 percent below its 2008 peak and unemployment is at a record high, but the 17-member bloc is set to expand for the second quarter in a row after 18 months of contraction, according to Bert Colijn, an economist with the Conference Board in Brussels. Even the construction industry, which crashed when the financial crisis struck, appears to be bottoming out. \"The outlook continues to improve for Europe in general,\" Colijn said. \"The fact that we're seeing a momentum change at the moment is a positive signal.\" Jim O'Neill, former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the PMIs of the entire Group of Seven advanced industrial countries were all rising quite significantly for the first time since 2008. An exceptionally strong reading last week for the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing survey also hinted that the global economy was stirring. \"It's quite conceivable that declining commodity prices are giving a big lift to real incomes,\" O'Neill said. CONGRESS MUDDIES THE WATERS That's the good news. The bad news is that the Fed, in deciding not to start scaling back its bond buying, has created new uncertainty by playing down the importance of the unemployment rate in isolation as a guide to its monetary policy. In June, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said he expected to start withdrawing stimulus this year and end asset purchases by mid-2014, when the jobless rate was likely to be near 7 percent. Last Wednesday, adopting a more discretionary stance, he emphasized that he had no fixed calendar in mind. <ID:L2N0HE1YZ> Although markets initially cheered the tapering reprieve, economists polled by Reuters said the Fed had failed to communicate its views clearly in advance. Because the Bank of England has also tied its policy to hitting a precise unemployment target, the U.S. central bank's shift could have broader repercussions. \"The Fed's move is a major blow for the credibility of forward guidance,\" O'Neill said. In standing pat, Bernanke said he needed more evidence of solid growth and fretted over a sharp tightening in financial conditions since he first flagged that tapering was on the way. Robert Wescott, president of Keybridge Research in Washington, put more weight on a third reason Bernanke gave - a fast-approaching showdown in Washington over the 2014 budget and an increase in the federal debt ceiling. \"I do think at the margin that was the factor that tipped them into not acting,\" Wescott told a conference organized by Oxford Analytica, a consultancy. If the Senate and House of Representatives fail to pass a funding bill, the government could shut down on October 1. Although most Congress-watchers doubt it will come to that, Democrats and Republicans are digging in, ensuring a nervous end to the month for markets that could deflect attention from revised GDP, durable goods and housing data. GERMANY AND EUROPE Another source of uncertainty is the shape of Germany's new government after Sunday's general election and what it will mean for Berlin's policy towards the euro. Angela Merkel is expected to remain chancellor but she might need as long as two months to form a coalition. If Merkel's Christian Democrats cannot continue to govern with the liberal Free Democrats but are forced into a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats, Germany may be more open to forging a banking union without an arduous treaty change, said Hartmut Mayer, a fellow in politics at Oxford University. Mechanisms to supervise, bail out and close down banks at the euro zone level are critical to putting the single currency on a firmer foundation. The Social Democrats would also be more open to the principle of euro zone debt mutualization as part of an ultimate solution to southern Europe's debt overhang, Mayer said. \"It would be the same chancellor but a different constellation and I think that makes a difference, he said.

      " As well as Yili and Mengniu, the first group of firms to benefit would include Feihe International Inc ADY.BE, Heilongjiang Wondersun Dairy Co Ltd and Treasure of Plateau, the official China Business Journal said in its Saturday edition, citing an unidentified source. Authorities have said they want to consolidate the domestic milk powder sector to increase the ability of companies to compete with international rivals who dominate the lucrative premium end of China's $12.4 billion infant formula market. Officials at Yili, Mengniu and Feihe were not immediately available for comment. Chinese milk powder firms would gain the support in the form of government subsidies, funds from China Development Bank and favorable tax policies, the China Business Journal said. The total amount would be about 30 billion yuan, it said. Milk powder is a sensitive topic in China after a 2008 scandal involving milk tainted with melamine led to the deaths of at least six infants and made many thousands ill. That hit the reputation of domestic dairy firms and boosted the market share of imported brands such as Danone SA ( DANO.PA ), Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ), Mead Johnson Nutrition Co ( MJN.N ) and Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ). But international milk powder has recently come under the spotlight, with China temporarily banning some dairy products from New Zealand's Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd FCGHA.NZ, after a scare. Last month, the country's price regulator handed down record fines to mostly foreign milk powder makers. Last week, official Chinese television said French food group Danone SA had bribed doctors and nurses to recommend its Dumex milk powder brand at a hospital in northern China, and said the practice was widespread in the sector. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has previously released a plan to slash the number of domestic infant formula firms in the highly fragmented market over the next five years to 50 from about 200 now as it looks to create stronger sector leaders. According to data from market research firm Euromonitor, Yili and Wondersun were the two leading Chinese milk powder producers by retail value in 2012. Feihe and Mengniu were in the top ten.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - More than 600 bank branches being rebranded as TSB by Britain's Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) could be bought by a trade or financial buyer before a flotation being planned for next year, the head of the new business said. \n",
      " Lloyds was ordered to sell the branches by European regulators as a penalty for receiving a 20-billion-pound ($32 billion) government bailout in the 2008 financial crisis. However, a deal with the Co-operative Bank ( CPBB_p.L ) collapsed in April amid concerns over the Co-op's capital strength. Lloyds now plans to run the business on a standalone basis ahead of a listing in summer 2014, although TSB's new boss Paul Pester said that could change. \"It's absolutely possible that someone may come in and say this is a fantastic business we'll make you an offer for it. That's something we can leave Lloyds to deal with,\" Pester told reporters at the launch of the new business in central London. The return of the 200-year-old TSB brand to the high street after an 18-year absence is the result of action by regulators and the government to introduce greater competition in the country's banking sector. Pester said TSB would focus on a local banking model, \"supporting economic growth in the communities it serves\". It will become Britain's 8th biggest retail bank with 4.5 million customers and a 4.3 percent share of the current account market. However, Lloyds' Group Retail Director Allison Britton told Reuters TSB's management would initially be granted only \"semi- independence\" from its parent. \"They can do quite a lot of things themselves but they still might have to ask me about many things. They can propose pricing changes for products but I have to approve them. The same would go with things like risk appetite,\" she said. An influential cross-party committee of lawmakers set up to review standards within the industry said in June that a lack of competition in UK retail banking was an important reason why poor standards of conduct persisted in the industry. Susan Kramer, a Liberal Democrat peer who sat on the committee, said there was still a lot to be done to break the dominance of Britain's biggest four high street lenders - RBS ( RBS.L ), Lloyds, Barclays ( BARC.L ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) - which control around three-quarters of retail accounts. \"There's a long way to go to get to the point where consumers have a real range of choices, where competition bites in such a way that it changes the behavior of the big players,\" she told Reuters. Lloyds' Britton said the bank was aiming for a stock market listing for the TSB business in the summer of 2014 and that the sale of the business would be done in stages. \"It will be quick. We set ourselves a number of goals - finishing this divestment, repaying the government, returning to dividends and profitability. The sooner we can do all of those things the better,\" she said. Britton said she anticipated investor appetite for the stock, despite a number of other bank share issues scheduled for the coming months including a rights issue by Barclays, the sale of the government's stake in Lloyds itself, and a possible listing of 315 branches by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). \"It's a nice balanced strongly-capitalized fully UK-orientated bank with a good distribution network. I think it'll be a great stock but it all comes down to the market and the price on the day,\" she said.

      " Last week, the two companies applied to set up a new New Delhi-based full-service carrier, pledging a combined $100 million to get it going. This follows an unsuccessful attempt to do the same in the mid-1990s and a failed attempt to buy state-owned Air India in 2000. The new carrier, if approved, will initially serve the 1.2 billion Indian market. Barring no political or regulatory obstacles, it could be airborne in about a year. SIA, which will have a 49 percent stake in the carrier, will be banking on its success. Intense competition on its mainline medium and long-haul markets from Gulf carriers like Emirates Airline and neighbors such as Garuda Indonesia ( GIAA.JK ) and Malaysian Airline ( MASM.KL ), and weak demand on services to Europe, means that SIA, Asia's second-biggest airline with a market value of $10 billion, has changed course in recent years. Sources familiar with the airline's strategy say that the management, led by low-profile chief executive Goh Choon Phong, is pushing ahead with a \"portfolio\" strategy that revolves around increasing the company's exposure to the fast-growing Asia Pacific and the low-cost markets. By diversifying its revenue streams and creating new ones, like the Indian joint venture, Goh and his team plans to reduce SIA's dependence on the flagship carrier over the medium term, say investors and analysts. \"They just have to address why their brand should still be at a premium. They still have a lot to do to actually get investors to be a bit more confident of their prospects,\" said Kristy Fong, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, which holds a stake of about 4 percent in SIA. CASH POWER Despite the near term pressure on profits, SIA's cash pile of $4.5 billion - the biggest among Asian airlines - means that it has the ability to invest in existing and new airlines, the Centre for Aviation (CAPA) said in a report. It started Scoot, a long-haul low-cost airline, last year to tap the low-fare leisure markets that SIA left behind as it focused on the premium business. Its one-third stake in short-haul LCC Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd ( TAHL.SI ) could also potentially go up to 46.5 percent. SIA bought a stake in Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd ( VAH.AX ) in late 2012 and increased this to 19.9 percent, ensuring access to the important Australian market. Silkair, SIA's fully-owned regional subsidiary, will retire its fleet of Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A320s and induct new Boeing ( BA.N ) 737s over the next few years as it grows its network of Asia-Pacific services. SIA itself has ordered dozens of new Airbus A350s, and Boeing's 777-300ERs and 787-10s. The Indian venture has its challenges. SIA must successfully chart a course around India's political and bureaucratic minefield for regulatory approval. Under existing regulations, it must serve the domestic market for five years before it can operate international flights. Taxes and airport fees are high, and profitability rare for the country's airlines. SIA's competitors in the full-service segment are beleaguered Air India, which survives only because of the hundreds of millions of dollars New Delhi has pumped into it, and Jet Airways ( JET.NS ), in which Etihad Airways is buying a minority stake.

      " Production from the field, which once supplied 5 percent of Britain's gas output, has been suspended since 2010 as a result of international sanctions against Iran. But with signs of a thaw in relations between Iran and the West, the government now hopes to win agreement from the European Union and the United States for a sanctions waiver in the near future, the newspaper said, citing people close to the talks. One stumbling block to a deal, however, could be concerns from companies involved in financing and servicing the field that any exemption for the producers would not fully protect them from legal action, it added. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: \"We are working to ensure the long-term security of the Rhum gas field but no decision has been made at this time on a solution.\" A spokesman for BP declined to comment on the possibility of a waiver being granted. \"As operator of the field our priorities are two-fold - to ensure the field remains safe and that we remain compliant with the law,\" he said. \"It is up to the government to decide on the longer-term options.\" (Reporting by  Paul Sandle  and  Andrew Callus ; Editing by  Robin Pomeroy )\n",

      " Production at the mine, which began on October 4, is expected to lead to an annual output of 45,000 metric tons of concentrate, the company said in a securities filing on Thursday. Copper concentrate is a raw version of commercial copper that is later refined by smelters. Vale's efforts to increase copper production are part of a strategy by the company, the world's largest producer of iron ore, to diversify into other commodities. In addition to copper, Vale in recent years has pushed into coal and fertilizer production. After increased efforts in nickel mining, the company this year expects to overtake Russia's Norilsk Nickel ( GMKN.MM ) as the world's biggest producer of nickel. Still, iron ore at present accounts for about 90 percent of Vale's profits and nearly three-quarters of its revenues. The Lubambe mine is a joint venture with African Rainbow Minerals Ltd.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened in August, in line with analyst expectations, as U.S. goods exports fell for the fifth consecutive month, a government report showed on Thursday. \n",
      " The monthly trade gap increased to $44.2 billion, from an upwardly revised estimate of $42.5 billion in July, the Commerce Department said. Analysts were expecting an August trade gap of about $44.0 billion. Overall U.S. exports dropped 1.0 percent as troubles in Europe continue to weigh on global growth, while imports fell 0.1 percent in a sign of faltering U.S. demand for consumer products, autos and capital goods. Exports of oil, chemicals and other industrial supplies fell to the lowest level since February 2011, helping pull down the entire goods category, despite an increase in capital goods exports to the second-highest level on record. Services exports defied the overall trend and rose to a record $52.8 billion, due mostly to increases in professional and business services and transportation. Services imports also set a record, reflecting licensing fees to broadcast the Summer Olympic games in Britain. The average price for imported oil rose slightly in August to $94.36 per barrel, helping to push the monthly oil import bill higher. A separate Labor Department report showed that overall U.S. import prices rose 1.1 percent for the second consecutive month in September, while U.S. export prices rose 0.8 percent. Both increases were above expectations. Analysts surveyed before the report had expected a 0.7 percent increase in import prices and a 0.4 percent rise in export prices.

      " (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co's ( JPM.N ) chief financial officer, Doug Braunstein, may step down and take another position with the bank, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. \n",
      " The move would be the latest management change at the bank, which has been roiled by $6 billion of losses from bad bets on derivatives. The person familiar with the matter said Wednesday that any shift would be Braunstein's decision, and would be unrelated to the trades. In July, JPMorgan announced new co-heads for commercial and investment banking and placed a co-chief operating officer in the reporting line between Braunstein and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Dimon had testified a month earlier to a U.S. Senate committee that Braunstein was one of the people who had wrongly assured him in April that the derivatives losses were not a big deal. Analysts believed the executive changes in July were designed to add checks and balances to the bank's senior ranks after the trading losses, which have brought intense regulatory scrutiny to the bank. Dimon told Reuters at the time that the shifts had been in the works before the bad trades, and were designed to help the bank cope with the increased complexity that financial companies face globally. Braunstein did not return a call to his cell phone seeking comment on his possible job change, and the bank declined to comment. The timing for any job change for Braunstein is unclear. The bank is set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday. The $6 billion of trading losses came from a JPMorgan group called the Chief Investment Office (CIO), which managed risk for the bank and invested deposits. The CIO group in London took large bets on derivatives, with one trader taking big enough positions to be called \"the London Whale.\" The bank first disclosed possible losses in May, and in July said that some traders may have lied about the value of their positions to the bank, adding fuel to government probes into the trades. Regulators and agencies including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are all looking at the bank. On Wednesday, Dimon told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, \"We made a stupid error. He added: \"I should have caught it ... I didn't.\" Even with the trading losses, JPMorgan Chase earned $5 billion in the second quarter. In narrative accounts of the bad trades by multiple media outlets, including a more-than-7,000 word piece published in this weekend's New York Times Magazine, Braunstein is not mentioned. JPMorgan said last week in an internal memo that Barry Zubrow was retiring. Zubrow was head of risk management at the bank when it was building a dangerously large position in credit derivatives. In January, months before the bank announced the bad derivatives trades, Zubrow switched to heading corporate and regulatory affairs. News of Braunstein's possible job switch was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. (Additional reporting by Sarah N.

It's a very large change and a low level but I suspect some kind of special factor was involved. One suggestion was that most of the decline came from one state, which suggests a problem with data collection was involved. \"The trade numbers showed a little bit of widening in the trade deficit. It looks like net exports will contribute negatively to GDP growth, subtracting as much as a half a percentage point from GDP growth.\" DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK \"There was a big surprise in the fall. It was probably partly erratic and assisted by seasonal adjustments, given the fall we have had in the unemployment rate. It does seem like there is something going on maybe in the labor market. The Labor Department said most of the fall came in one state. The numbers are probably exaggerating the scale of the labor market improvement, but it does seem that there is something going on. \"Import prices were a little higher than expected and last month was upwardly revised. The higher import prices are contributing to a wider trade deficit, but also export numbers were a bit disappointing.\" BRIAN KIM, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBS SECURITIES, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT \"This is a positive signal for the economy.

      " PARIS  (Reuters) - French retailer Carrefour SA ( CARR.PA ) said its home market was showing signs of improvement, reassuring investors that an action plan being implemented by new Chief Executive Georges Plassat is starting to bear fruit. \n",
      " Plassat joined Carrefour in May with a brief to reverse years of underperformance in Carrefour's main European markets, where the hypermarkets in which it had heavily invested have been hit by competition from specialist stores and trends toward local and online shopping. Shares in the world's second-largest retailer after U.S. group Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) were up 4.4 percent at 16.70 euros by 0858 GMT, the top riser on the CAC 40 index of French blue-chip stocks  .FCHI . \"After a positive surprise in the first half and another ... in the third quarter, confidence could quietly return in the new management's ability to put things back on track,\" analysts at brokerage Aurel BGC said in a note. Plassat, who has a record of company restructuring and whose reputation as a cost-cutter earned him the nickname of \"Le Nettoyeur\" (cleaner), took over from retiring Lars Olofsson and is trying to around the company's fortunes. He said in August he would slash costs and defend key markets like France, Brazil and China, but has so far provided little detail on his turnaround plan. Carrefour's third-quarter statement showed sales up 0.2 percent on a like-for-like basis at 22.63 billion euros ($29.2 billion), above an average forecast of 22.57 billion in a Reuters poll of seven banks and brokerages, as robust demand in Latin America made up for weakness in austerity-hit Spain and Italy. Revenue in France stripping out fuel declined 1.5 percent, an improvement from a 3.3 percent drop in the second quarter and indicating initiatives such as offering cash-strapped shoppers lasting price cuts, introduced last year and strengthened by Plassat, are starting to have an impact. France accounts for more than 40 percent of group sales. ENCOURAGING SIGNS \"While we are pleased with these encouraging signs, we are still hard at work in France,\" Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon told a conference call. The group said it was comfortable with analyst estimates for 2012 earnings of between 2.07 and 2.10 billion euros, before interest and taxes (EBIT), against 2.18 billion last year. Sales at Carrefour's French hypermarkets fell 3.3 percent in the third quarter, against a 5.7 percent fall in the second quarter. Sales in the food sector improved for a third consecutive quarter. Sivignon told analysts the sales trend for non-food items such as textiles and electronics had also marginally improved but remained difficult in French hypermarkets. He said \"price image\", a closely watched perception shoppers have of how expensive Carrefour is compared with rivals, was also gradually improving. \"It's a long-term effort but the trend is there,\" he said. Many retailers across Europe are struggling as consumers' disposable incomes have been squeezed by rising prices, muted wage growth and government austerity measures, as well as changing consumer habits. Last week Metro AG ( MEOG.DE ), the world's fourth-largest retailer, cut its earnings outlook for 2012, blaming rising unemployment in the euro zone and the sovereign debt crisis, while Britain's biggest retailer Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) recently reported a 12.4 percent drop in UK trading profit. Carrefour still has big operations in some of the countries worst hit by the crisis, such as Spain and Italy, having pulled out of Greece. Spain and Italy accounted for more than 16 percent of group sales in the third quarter. Quarterly like-for-like sales excluding petrol fell 5.4 percent in Spain and 6.6 percent in Italy. The trend for non-food sales in Spain was slightly better, but Sivignon cautioned that a new batch of austerity measures there could have an impact on fourth-quarter consumption. In emerging markets, China continued to struggle, while Brazil, Carrefour's second-largest market after France, had like-for-like sales growth of 9.7 percent.

Traders have been bearish recently, with the S&P 500 down 2 percent in the last five sessions in anticipation of a weak earnings season. News that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to its lowest level in more than 4-1/2 years gave the market only marginal support. \"Unless we get blowout numbers in the earnings season, this sort of volatile environment will likely continue in the near term,\" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at New York-based Banyan Partners. AT&T ( T.N ) and Verizon ( VZ.N ) also weighed after news that Japan's Softbank ( 9984.T ) may buy a majority stake in their competitor, Sprint Nextel ( S.N ). Sprint shares rallied more than 13 percent but AT&T and Verizon lost more than 1 percent each on expectations of harsher market competition. The S&P 500 is just over 8 percent below its record closing high, set five years ago, and the corporate results season that started this week is expected to show the first drop in year-on-year quarterly earnings since 2009. \"We're so close to all-time highs, and there's so much talk of fundamentally having no reason to be here, that people are taking profits,\" said Doreen Mogavero, CEO of Mogavero, Lee & Co in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 18.58 points, or 0.14 percent, to 13,326.39. The S&P 500  .SPX  edged up 0.28 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,432.84. The Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  dipped 2.37 points, or 0.08 percent, to 3,049.41. Energy stocks .GSPE led gains in the main 10 S&P 500 sectors with a 0.6 percent advance. Coal miner Peabody Energy ( BTU.N ) rose 8.9 percent to $26.18 and its peer Consol Energy ( CNX.N ) added 8 percent to $35.48 on bets higher natural gas prices would encourage coal use by power producers. Sprint shares jumped 14.3 percent to $5.76 on news of the possible acquisition by Japan's Softbank, while AT&T lost 1.8 percent to $36.26 and Verizon dropped 1.3 percent to $45.20. Clearwire Corp CLWR.O, in which Sprint holds a majority interest, surged 70.8 percent to $2.22. Truck manufacturer Oshkosh ( OSK.N ) rallied 11.4 percent to $29.90 on news that investor Carl Icahn had offered to buy all of its shares for $32.50 each. OshKosh advised shareholders to take no action until further notice. Dollar Tree ( DLTR.O ), off 7.7 percent to $43.28, led percentage declines among discretionary sector stocks after it said it will post third-quarter sales at the lower end of its earlier forecast. The S&P retail sector index .RLX fell 0.9 percent. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, slightly below the daily average so far this year of about 6.52 billion shares. On the NYSE, almost two issues rose for every one that fell and on the Nasdaq three issues rose for every two that posted declines. (Editing by Kenneth Barry and Dan Grebler)\n"

      " Both economies are at the center of the euro zone debt crisis, with Greece struggling to fulfill a debt-reduction program and Spain inching towards seeking aid to handle its debts, having already obtained a 100-billion-euro credit line for its banks in June. \"Instead of frontloading heavily, it is sometimes better, given circumstances and the fact that many countries at the same time go through that same set of policies with a view to reducing their deficit, it is sometimes better to have a bit more time,\" Lagarde said at a news conference in Tokyo. \"That is what I have advocated for Portugal, this is what I have advocated for Spain, and this is what we are advocating for Greece, where I said repeatedly that an additional two years was necessary for the country to actually face the fiscal consolidation program that is considered.\" A report on the Greek program from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF - known as the troika - is due in the next few weeks. European officials said on Monday divergences had emerged inside the euro zone and with the IMF over how best to proceed, especially on whether Athens should obtain some respite in its deficit-cutting efforts. Spain is also under pressure as the IMF, the Bank of Spain and many economists have said that the economic forecast the government used to build its budget plan for 2013 was too optimistic, putting the country at risk of missing its deficit targets. The IMF forecast Spain's economy would shrink 1.3 percent next year, which compares with a forecast for a 0.5 percent contraction used in next year's budget. Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos on Monday said Madrid would stick to its targets and was not planning any further cuts. The euro zone has already eased fiscal targets for Spain once this year. On Monday, the euro zone gave Portugal one more year, until 2014, to get its budget deficit below the European Union ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday slapped steep final duties on billions of dollars of solar energy products from China, but turned down a request from lawmakers and U.S. manufacturers to expand the scope of its order. \n",
      " China's government and its solar manufacturers criticized the decision, adding more heat to the U.S.-China trade relationship following a congressional panel report on Monday urging American companies not to do business with two Chinese telecommunications companies because of security concerns. \"The United States is provoking trade friction in the new energy sector, and sending a negative signal to the world that stirs global trade protectionism and obstructs the sector's development,\" said China's Commerce Ministry spokesman Shen Danyang. Shen called on Washington to \"correct its mistaken ways\" and warned that the duties would harm U.S. exporters and customers. The U.S. Commerce Department said Chinese companies were \"dumping\" solar cells and panels in the United States at prices 18.32 percent to 249.96 percent below fair value, although some individual companies received lower anti-dumping duty rates than in a preliminary decision earlier this year. The department also set additional countervailing duties ranging from 14.78 to 15.97 percent to combat Chinese government subsidies, significantly higher than preliminary levels. The United States imported about $3.1 billion worth of solar cells and panels from China in 2011, although that figure contains some products not covered by the investigation. In a related decision that disappointed U.S. producers and cheered U.S. companies that install solar panels, the department turned down pleas to expand the scope of its order to include Chinese panels (or modules) made with non-Chinese solar cells. Timothy Brightbill, outside attorney for SolarWorld Industries Americas, the driving force behind the U.S. case, said the company would continue to aggressively pursue that issue in the hopes of a more favorable ruling. \"In our view, all Chinese cells and all Chinese modules are dumped and subsidized,\" Brightbill said SolarWorld is worried the department's current stance on the issue will encourage Chinese solar panel producers to move cell production to nearby countries to avoid U.S. duties, he said. But Jigar Shah, president of the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy, which includes Chinese and U.S. companies that oppose SolarWorld's case, said including panels with non-Chinese cells in the order would have \"created a lot more chaos.\" The Commerce Department's decision not to expand the scope is a \"silver lining\" to an otherwise disappointing decision on duties, Shah said. MASSIVE OVERSUPPLY The United States also has slapped preliminary duties on wind turbine towers from China and is expected to launch a new probe next week into charges that imports of Chinese hardwood plywood are unfairly priced and subsidized. \"We have the most squabbles with our biggest trading partners,\" said Scott Miller, a trade policy specialist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explaining the steady stream of U.S.-China trade spats. In the solar sector, producers in the United States and Europe complain China's rapid expansion of solar panel manufacturing has created massive oversupply, erasing profits and sending company share prices into a tailspin. SolarWorld's German parent has also been behind a charge in Europe for duties on Chinese solar panel imports. China has already struck back by launching an investigation into imports of solar-grade polysilicon from both the United States and South Korea. Chinese manufacturer Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd on Wednesday was hit with a final anti-dumping duty of 31.73 percent and a countervailing duty of 14.78 percent. However, combined duty rates for Suntech and other companies will be reduced by about 10.54 percentage points to avoid \"double-counting\" of Chinese export subsidies in the anti-dumping and countervailing duty rates. Trina Solar Ltd received a final 18.32 percent anti-dumping duty and a 15.97 percent countervailing duty. Well over a hundred companies were hit with a 25.96 percent anti-dumping duty and a 15.24 percent countervailing duty. Trina said in a statement that it was waiting for a decision from the U.S. International Trade Commission, a separate U.S. government agency, which must give its approval for the duties to take force, before deciding whether to appeal. The ITC vote is expected in early November. Importers have been, however, required to post bonds or cash deposits based on the preliminary rates. The Commerce Department also set a China-wide anti-dumping rate of 249.96 percent for other Chinese producers and exporters. The Obama administration has heavily backed solar and other renewable energy since taking office, pledging about $16 billion for 26 projects through its clean energy loan program. Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney has criticized the support, saying the federal government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers.

      " BERLIN  (Reuters) - Bentley and Lamborghini's plans to develop ultra-luxury SUVs may be put on hold to save cash for parent Volkswagen, company sources said, in a sign that the crisis is beginning to bite even for the German auto giant. \n",
      " U.K.-based Bentley and the Italian supercar maker rolled out extravagant concept sport utility vehicles (SUV) at the auto shows in Geneva and Beijing this year, with production awaiting approval by VW's management board. The push towards off-roaders is aimed at boosting profitability at Lamborghini, loss-making since 2009, and Bentley. The move has dismayed Lamborghini purists who fear that expanding to four-by-fours will dilute the brand's exclusivity. Grappling with unforeseen production cuts and slowing auto sales, VW may postpone the models as it reviews planned spending on equipment, factories and vehicles due to be ratified by VW's supervisory board on November 23, two company sources said. \"Such vehicles are anything but obligatory during a crisis,\" said Frankfurt-based Equinet AG analyst Tim Schuldt. \"Delaying their launch would be no drama but help save costs.\" VW, on course to overtake U.S. rival General Motors as the world's second-biggest carmaker behind Toyota Motor Corp, has outperformed the European market this year. The German company's eight-month EU-wide sales were flat at 2.05 million cars, compared with a 7.1 percent drop to 8.27 million vehicles for the 27-nation region's market. The Wolfsburg-based maker of the Golf hatchback said on Tuesday that sales at its flagship passenger car brand rose just 4.3 percent to 492,500 vehicles in September, the smallest gain in eight months. VW halted production in Germany of its Passat model for two days last week as part of a wider move to cut group output by about 300,000 vehicles to 9.4 million cars this year. That would be up on last year's output of 8.5 million but short of the goal originally set for 2012 of about 9.7 million, company sources said on October 5. Finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch signaled at the Paris auto show that the slump in European demand could spark further austerity measures at VW. \"In this environment, we need to have a considerable amount of liquidity available,\" Poetsch said on September 26. \"It's normal that one looks for items that aren't imperative,\" he added, referring to investments that could potentially be pushed back. Bentley and Lamborghini would be up against stiff new competition with their plush SUVs; Fiat's Maserati will start production next year of the Jeep-based Kubang, while UK-based Land Rover will launch the new Range Rover Sport in 2014. Ferrari has had a family car, the FF, its biggest model, in its range since last year. The two VW divisions aim to replicate Porsche's success with the Cayenne SUV, which now accounts for half the sports-car maker's deliveries. But exorbitant pricing, fierce competition and a limited pool of buyers in markets such as China may restrain their sales, according to research firm IHS Automotive. His said production of the Bentley SUV, scheduled to start in late 2014, might peak at fewer than 4,000 cars in 2016, while the Lamborghini Urus could reach a maximum of fewer than 2,400 in 2018, a year after the model started rolling off the line. \"It'll be tough to turn the models into sustainable business cases,\" Frankfurt-based IHS analyst Henner Lehne said. Bentley could not confirm that its first-ever SUV, code-named EXP 9-F, would be delayed. It will continue to push for the model to get the nod from VW's leadership, spokeswoman Kerstin Sachl said on Wednesday, adding the British carmaker was hoping for a decision by the end of the year. Lamborghini chief executive Stephan Winkelmann told Reuters on September 27 that while VW has yet to sign off on the Urus, the Italian manufacturer would continue with the model's development.

      " SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - The directors of troubled Bumi Plc ( BUMIP.L ), one of the world's largest thermal coal exporters, gathered for a board meeting on Thursday amid an uncertain future for the company created by British-born financier Nat Rothschild and Indonesia's Bakrie family. \n",
      " Allegations of financial irregularities, against a background of weak coal prices and tumbling shares, have strained already frayed relations between major investors in the London venture and fuelled speculation of a potential split. The meeting was being held in Singapore and Rothschild, 41-year-old scion of the Rothschild banking dynasty, was in the city, sources close to the company said. They said the board members had dinner together on Wednesday night. The board includes Rothschild, Indra Bakrie, one of the Bakrie brothers, and Samin Tan, an Indonesian billionaire who pulled the Bakries back from default last year with a $1 billion investment, only to watch the value of his shares crumble. The Bakries and Tan each hold half of a 47.6 percent stake in Bumi Plc, while Rothschild owns 12 percent. The relationship between Rothschild and the Bakries, one of Indonesia's most powerful and politically connected families, has soured over the past year, particularly after a leaked letter from the financier last November that called for a \"radical clean-up\". The letter was seen as a sign of his frustration with the Bakrie family, whose patriarch Aburizal Bakrie is an Indonesian presidential candidate. Tan and the Bakries pushed out Rothschild as co-chairman in March and Tan became chairman. But relations have also frayed between the Bakries and Tan. Sources have said Tan is \"furious\" with the Bakries after watching the value of his investment plunge -- the shares he bought are worth only one-ninth the level at which he came in. The board meeting is the first since an inquiry into potential wrongdoing at the group's Indonesian operations was announced last month. The independent probe, being led by a London law firm and still in progress, has revived worries over governance at Bumi Plc and concerns over the woes of its debt-burdened affiliate, PT Bumi Resources ( BUMI.JK ), the jewel in the Bakrie empire. Heightening tensions before the Singapore meeting, the Bakries said on Wednesday that telephones and e-mail accounts belonging to the family and its group of companies had been hacked, pointing to unspecified \"suspicions\" over whom to blame. The incident has been reported to Indonesian police. WRITTEN DOWN Most of the allegations of financial irregularity, expected to total more than $500 million, relate to Bumi Resources, the flagship Bakrie miner and Indonesia's largest coal producer. Two of three investments at the center of the probe, though, have already been written down to zero by the London parent. \"While we are not able to quantify the amounts involved in these irregularities, we believe this investigation may reinforce the idea that the company needs to address its complex corporate structure,\" analysts at JP Morgan, the bank that fostered the creation of Bumi, said in a note last month. Bumi was listed in London last year via a reverse takeover engineered by Rothschild that aimed to create an international coal-mining powerhouse with operations in Indonesian Borneo, and one of the biggest listed companies on the London exchange. The deal highlighted the promise of Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy, which boasts some of the world's largest deposits of coal, gold, copper, tin and natural gas, spread across an archipelago of 17,000 islands. But banks and dealmakers looking for long-term investments in Indonesia must tread carefully around the powerful local conglomerate heads. The Borneo coal mines at the heart of the deal once belonged to global energy companies Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ), BP ( BP.L ) and BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ), which sold them to the Bakries in 2001 and 2003, after facing pressure from nationalists to divest their assets to local interests. Sources familiar with the matter said Thursday's board meeting was a scheduled gathering, with a long-planned to-do list - but top of the agenda will be progress made by lawyers on their probe, which could run into next month. The meeting of the board members, 16 after the resignation of former CEO Ari Hudaya, is expected to include Chairman Samin Tan, co-Chairman Indra Bakrie and Rothschild, and is therefore unlikely to escape discussion on the future of the group. At least one of the sources, though, said no restructuring could be decided before the full investigation was completed. Bumi Plc has long said it would like to bring together Bumi Resources, in which it owns 29 percent, and coal miner Berau, in which it owns 85 percent, into a single operating holding. But options being considered by teams of advisers courting Bumi in recent weeks include more radical solutions, such as a divorce of Bumi Resources from the group. Bumi Plc's board could also seek to replace Hudaya, who was chief executive until March and is still chief executive of Bumi Resources. Two sources also said they could not exclude other changes.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Over half a million foreign visitors to the London Olympics and Paralympics may have helped lift the British economy out of recession, although total tourist numbers fell during the Games. \n",
      " Just over 3 million overseas residents visited Britain in August, 5 percent fewer than in August 2011, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday. But Britain's earnings in August - including Olympic and Paralympic tickets bought before and during the Games - rose 9 percent on the year. \"The average amount of money spent by those people who either made their visit for an Olympics or Paralympics purpose or attended a ticketed event was almost twice as much as the average spent among other visitors,\" the ONS said. Based on its surveys, the ONS estimates that some 590,000 visitors came to Britain during July and August either for the Games or at least attended one ticketed event. The noticeable lack of visitors in London's theatres, museums and on buses and trains during the Olympics have raised concerns that the Games could hurt British businesses as other tourists stayed away to avoid the crowds. IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer pointed out that the weak economic situation in many countries across the globe might have also been a reason for the fall in tourist numbers. \"While the impact of the Olympic Games and the Paralympics on the number of overseas visitors coming to the UK in August may be open to differing interpretations, it is evident that the Games did boost spending by overseas visitors to the UK,\" he said. The British economy is widely expected to have posted some growth in the July-September period as production bounced back from a hit caused by the extra public holiday in June. Economists in a Reuters poll expect growth of 0.6 pct in the quarter, which would mean an end to the recession after three consecutive quarters of contraction. The ONS has already said that all ticket revenues from the July 27-August 12 Olympics and the August 29-September 9 Paralympics will be accounted for in the third quarter, boosting quarterly GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points.

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. housing market is starting to thaw, but it could be two years before a full-blown recovery takes hold, Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) Chief Executive Frank Blake said on Thursday. \n",
      " The world's largest home improvement retailer has seen the benefits of the nascent U.S. housing recovery as professional contractors have started buying more in recent months. \"It's starting to recover, but we're a long way away from true recovery,\" Blake, 63, told Reuters in a wide-ranging interview that touched on his views of the so-called Fiscal Cliff to why he sees the internet as Home Depot's next frontier. The comments came less than a week after two influential Federal Reserve officials blamed the disappointing rebound in U.S. housing for continuing to trip up the country's overall economic recovery. \"This housing market's been very, very bad and it's going to take some time to recover,\" Blake said. A bubble in the U.S. housing market was at the core of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which started the same year that Blake became CEO. During the housing downturn, Home Depot's sales at established stores fell more than 20 percent in markets such as Florida and California. \"The way we look at it is there's going to be a period of a workout, a fine period of one to two years and then you're going to get a more robust recovery,\" Blake said. Credit availability and the overhang of distressed housing are among the reasons the housing market can't \"just spring back\" to where it was before the recession, Blake said. While California and Florida, states slammed by the housing downturn, show signs of improvement, Blake urged investors not to read too much into the recent signs of recovery. \"We've had head fakes on the housing market coming back, so you always worry that this is a little bit of a head fake,\" Blake said. One way to tell the difference is whether or not consumers will again look at a home improvement as a cost they can recoup when they sell their home. \"The fundamental question asked in our business is does our customer think about a granite countertop as an expense or an investment?\" he said. TAKING THE ONLINE ROUTE As it looks for new areas of growth, Home Depot plans to concentrate on building its Internet business rather than overseas expansion, Blake said. Last month, Blake decided to close all seven of Home Depot's big box stores in China after a failed expansion attempt there. He said he views online business as the next area of expansion, rather than new geographic markets. \"Home Depot can afford not to be in Brazil. Home Depot can afford not to be in, name your country. Home Depot cannot afford not to be the best, what we call, inter-connected retailer in our space,\" said Blake. The retailer, which bought California-based Red Beacon earlier this year, is interested in making more acquisitions in Silicon Valley to boost its online business and other related capabilities, Blake said. Even in China, the retailer has already started selling goods on website 360buy.com and is looking for opportunities to partner with other e-commerce sites. FISCAL CLIFF Blake said he had not yet seen U.S. shoppers holding back from spending because of fears of the looming \"fiscal cliff.\" That is Washington's self-imposed year-end deadline to agree on a plan to shrink the federal budget or trigger $600 billion in spending cuts and higher taxes. \"We don't see that in consumer behavior,\" Blake said. He was less confident when asked if he thought Washington will find its way through the crisis. \"You never want to get too deep into a bet on the rationality of Washington,\" Blake replied.

      " ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's jobless rate topped 25 percent and its biggest company said it would quit the country on Thursday in a fresh blow to an economy that German experts warned cannot be \"saved\" without writing off more debt. \n",
      " The announcement by drinks bottler Coca Cola Hellenic (CCH) HLBr.AT that it was switching its primary listing from Athens to London, and moving its corporate base to stable, low-tax Switzerland, is a bitter blow to the debt-crippled nation. The firm, which bottles Coke and other drinks in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria, is Greece's biggest by market value and is 23 percent owned by The Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) of the United States. It said its Greek plants would be unaffected. CCH's announcement coincided with data that showed Greek unemployment climbing for a 35th consecutive month in July to 25.1 percent from a revised 24.8 percent in June. The jobless rate has more than tripled since the country's now five-year-old recession began. Fifty-four percent of Greeks aged 15-24 years are out of work, fuelling violent protests against the tax hikes, spending cuts and public sector job losses demanded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund in exchange for more than 200 billion euros ($258.03 billion) in loans since 2010. Greece is still far off target. IMF chief Christine Lagarde, speaking in Tokyo, backed calls to give the country two more years, up to 2016, to cut its debt mountain to 120 percent of GDP from 165 percent in 2011. The IMF is also pressing official lenders such as euro zone paymaster Germany to take a \"haircut\" on their Greek debt similar to that swallowed by private bondholders this year. With elections in 2013, Berlin is resisting, but Germany's leading economic institutes warned on Thursday that without further debt restructuring, the Greek economy would not make it. \"Yes, we don't think Greece can be saved,\" Joachim Scheide, head of forecasting at the Kiel-based IfW institute, said when asked whether investors in Greek debt would have to accept another haircut. \"We need a restructuring of Greek debt; that would help Greece best,\" he said. MORE AUSTERITY German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was greeted with angry protests on Tuesday on her first visit to Greece since the debt crisis erupted, opposes any further restructuring, at least until after Germans vote next September. Her visit came as the Greek government is locked in talks with its \"troika\" of international lenders on more austerity measures to secure a next tranche of loans worth 31.5 billion euros. Without further aid, Athens says it will run out of money by the end of next month. Data released by the finance ministry showed Greece had narrowed its central government budget deficit by 37 percent in the first nine months of the year. But the figures did not include spending on local municipalities and social security - the areas of most concern for the troika, which comprises the IMF, the European Union's executive Commission and the European Central Bank. Even after steep tax hikes, net government revenue stagnated at 36.7 billion euros, or 1.3 billion euros short of an interim target set under the bailout plan. Private businesses say the tax hikes are suffocating them. Coca Cola Hellenic had complained about the high tax measures, and on Thursday said it was relocating. Its Greek operations, which account for five percent of its bottling business, will be unaffected, but the move was bad news for a nation struggling to compete inside the euro zone. Chief executive Dimitris Lois said the decision to switch the company's primary listing to London and its corporate base to Switzerland made \"clear business sense\". Its move follows Greek dairy group FAGE's relocation to Luxembourg this month. \"This is a healthy company that does not want to suffer from Greece's high country risk,\" said an analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Analyst Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities in Athens said that the move made sense for the firm, which follows Greek dairy group FAGE this month in seeking a low-tax, low-volatility haven for its corporate base - in FAGE's case Luxembourg. \"The Greek bourse is losing a very good company and the London Stock Exchange is gaining a very important group,\" said Hatzidakis. \"It's very bad news for the Greek economy and bourse.\" COUNTRY RISK Another analyst said the firm, which rose to the top of corporate rankings as the values of Greek banks collapsed, was out to rid its share price of risks associated with Greece; the country is mired in recession and facing mass discontent as its leaders slash budgets to meet international creditors' terms for loans intended to keep Athens inside Europe's single currency. \"This is a healthy company that does not want to suffer from Greece's high country risk,\" said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign investors have been steadily reducing their investment in the Athens Stock Exchange  .ATG  since the country was engulfed by the sovereign debt crisis in 2009. Greece's future in the 17-nation euro zone still remains in doubt. Aided by the fact that it is doing most of its business outside Greece, CCH consistently outperformed the general Athens stock market index, which has slumped to 20-year lows. CCH has become the country's biggest firm by market value with a capitalization of around 6 billion euros ($7.7 billion), representing about a fifth of the Athens bourse's total. Typical daily trading in its shares has represented close to 10 percent of average volume on a Greek stock market where trade had already halved over the past year, squeezing broking firms. The company, which last year made net profit of 330 million euros on sales of 6.85 billion, has also complained of high taxes imposed under Greek government austerity measures. CCH said it would delist from the Athens Stock Exchange and then seek to re-enter that bourse with a secondary listing. Coca Cola Hellenic shares were down 5.8 percent at 15.49 euros in Athens after the news. Analysts explained the drop by the low cash price of 13.58 euros the company is offering to those shareholders who refuse the offer of new Swiss shares.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Tom Enders was flying high six weeks ago; newly elevated to the top job at Europe's EADS, his secret merger deal to create the world's biggest aerospace group and rid himself of burdensome government meddling was preparing for launch. \n",
      " But when \"Major Tom\", a pugnacious paratroop officer in the German army reserve, took off to go hang-gliding in late August, things began to go wrong. A painful crash that left his arms strapped up, robot-style, kept him only briefly from work; but it prevented him flying with Chancellor Angela Merkel on a trip to China where he might have hoped to win her as an ally. In the end, it seems unlikely even the most persuasive of her countrymen would have stopped Merkel shooting down the plan to merge with British defense contractor BAE Systems, which the firms pulled on Wednesday after governments failed to agree. But the tale of Enders' untimely fall to earth will stand as an image of how his daring bid to break the Airbus manufacturer free of political interference was brought down by exactly the kind of diplomatic turbulence he had hoped to put behind him. Within a couple of weeks of his accident, word of the $45-billion merger talks leaked, triggering a regulatory deadline in Britain to wrap up a deal by Wednesday; an ill-tempered free-for-all broke out among ministers in Paris, Berlin and London as well as corporate and institutional shareholders, many of them suspicious that Enders had been keeping them in the dark. Yet although the 53-year-old launched the idea with BAE Chief Executive Ian King in total secrecy in May, shortly before succeeding Frenchman Louis Gallois as CEO of European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. on June 1, the straight-talking Enders had never hidden his disdain for a corporate structure designed to protect national interests after a messy marriage 12 years ago. A particularly vocal public row a couple of years ago when Enders demanded more government backing up front for EADS' new military transport aircraft, the A400M, had won him few friends in politics, not least among his fellow Germans. And he kept on the offensive over the past year about those state holdings. These clipped EADS' wings, he argued, when it needed to fly free to compete, notably with American arch-rival Boeing. Addressing investors' doubts, he acknowledged during a presentation in London: \"This will not go down in history as the deal with the most cost synergies.\" Rather, as he wrote to employees of the group whose painful creation he witnessed at first hand in 2000, the merger would liberate EADS from constraints built into it at birth: \"If we succeed and if the EADS shareholder pact can be dissolved, our governance will be significantly simplified and 'normalized'.\" POLITICAL CROSSWINDS In the end, some will see an irony in that it was this very web of interlinked and competing European interests that brought down his plan, codenamed Hawthorn, to bring together Elm - as in E for EADS - and Birch - BAE - its partner in the Eurofighter jet and a big supplier of military hardware to the Pentagon. Though there was also skepticism among private shareholders, who questioned the benefits of the complementing airliners with weaponry in the combined group, it was crosswinds from political leaders that downed the talks before any merger deal was ready. French and British officials said their differences, once seen as the toughest to overcome, had been settled; London had accepted a continued French state shareholding and Paris agreed to limits it had sought to avoid. They both pointed to Berlin, where Merkel and her ministers kept stony silence, as the principal naysayer when time ran out for talks on Wednesday. \"It's a German government decision,\" one French official said. \"It's a great shame, because ... we had made progress. \"It would seem that the chancellor does not want the discussions to continue.\" In London, a source said: \"It was absolutely heading in the right direction ... There was very significant progress with France. There wasn't the same progress elsewhere.\" The German government, which unlike France is not directly a shareholder had, sources said, been offered parity with Paris in any combined group - something it wanted since carmaker Daimler has been looking to give up the biggest German stake in EADS. While others felt Berlin was offered good terms, including a stake in the firm and guarantees of jobs and office locations going to Germany, sources in the German government said a range of factors had soured Merkel on Enders' proposals. Those ranged from questions over the business logic and fears of damaging sales by possibly increasing state involvement to discomfort with involving Germany, still scarred by its militarist past, in what would become the world's biggest armaments manufacturer. As once source close to Merkel said: \"Defense is an especially sensitive subject in Germany.\" A London hedge fund manager, who profited from the collapse of a plan that had depressed EADS shares and boosted BAE's, reckoned Enders had been fighting a losing battle from the first: \"It proves that you can try to take the politics out of EADS,\" he said. \"But you can never take EADS out of politics.\" SECRET TALKS There were those who felt the managements' miscalculation had been in the very secrecy they hoped to maintain until a deal could be worked out away from the glare of public politicking. A source close to the Spanish government, which also has a stake in EADS, told Reuters: \"The fact that they tried to handle this deal behind the backs of the governments, who are the main shareholders, was a major error.\" Enders' position may now be questioned and EADS's ownership structure may in any case face a major shake-up as Daimler and French conglomerate Lagardere try to sell out, disrupting a complex and partly secret set of internal pacts. The CEO, who has relished publicity stunts like jumping out of his own firm's new military transporter from 12,000 feet, may now look back on where things went sour in talks that one source involved described as starting as \"a bit of banter\" between Enders and King. Within weeks of taking over the top job, that vague idea turned into a serious project in early July during a meeting at London's City Airport among a small group from both firms. Later that month, wider discussions including lawyers and bankers sketched out a plan that would fix the share of EADS investors in the combined group at 60 percent and BAE at 40. Over the summer, government officials were getting involved - though not quickly enough for the liking of some ministers. And the corporate teams were caught off guard when, on September 12, just two weeks after the hang-gliding accident had disrupted Enders' plan for an Airbus-centered trip to China with Merkel, the news of the talks leaked and Britain's takeover regulator set a 30-day clock ticking for them to make shareholders an offer - or show justification for extending the timetable. In the end, it was clear that, for now at least, it was a deal that wouldn't fly.

      " TOKYO  (Reuters) - The IMF on Thursday backed giving debt-burdened Greece and Spain more time to reduce their budget deficits, cautioning that cutting too far, too fast would do more harm than good. \n",
      " But Germany pushed back and said back-tracking on debt-reduction goals would only hurt confidence, a stance that suggested some disagreement between the International Monetary Fund and Europe's largest creditor country. \"The IMF has time and again said that high public debt poses a problem,\" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters. \"So when there is a certain medium-term goal, it doesn't build confidence when one starts by going in a different direction.\" \"When you want to climb a big mountain and you start climbing down then the mountain will get even higher.\" The IMF released new research this week showing that fiscal consolidation has a much sharper negative effect on growth than previously thought. Since the global financial crisis, these so-called fiscal multipliers have been as much as three times larger than they were before 2009, the IMF research shows. That means aggressive austerity measures may inflict deep economic wounds that make it harder for an economy to get out from under heavy debt burdens. \"It is sometimes better to have a bit more time,\" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said. \"That is what we advocated for Portugal; this is what we advocated for Spain; and this is what we are advocating for Greece.\" But the IMF was less willing to be patient with Europe on following through with its efforts to seek a more cohesive fiscal and banking union. It said that process was critically incomplete, and blamed the plodding pace for contributing to economic uncertainty that was hurting global growth. Emerging markets expressed frustration that the euro zone troubles were spilling into their economies. The IMF still expects emerging markets to grow four times as fast as advanced economies, but it cut its forecast sharply for two of the biggest players, Brazil and India. \"Europe has to get its act together,\" said Palaniappan Chidambaram, India's finance minister, speaking on behalf of the Group of 24 developing and emerging economies. \"What is happening in Europe is having an impact on developing countries.\" CREDITOR COUNTRIES The IMF has expressed frustration with Europe's piecemeal response to its debt crisis and warned that a recent respite in borrowing costs for debt-laden countries such as Spain may prove short-lived unless euro zone leaders come up with a comprehensive and credible plan. In its financial stability report on Wednesday, the IMF said that without swift policy action, including the triggering of the European Central Bank's bond-buying program, the premium that investors demand to hold Spanish and Italian debt instead of safer German bonds would nearly double. Standard & Poor's cut its rating on Spain on Wednesday to a level just above junk territory, and Moody's may soon follow. The IMF has said it stands ready to support a European bailout for Spain, should Madrid ask. Reuters reported on October 1 that Spain was ready to seek help, but that Germany was blocking an aid request because it preferred to combine a Spanish rescue with additional assistance for other struggling countries such as Greece. Jose Vinals, the head of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, warned that countries must not withhold help if Spain were to ask the European Central Bank to buy its bonds under a new bailout program, known as OMT for Outright Monetary Transaction. \"If it were to be the case that they decide to activate this mechanism and they can submit to the proper degree of conditionality, it would be essential that the creditor countries do not negate this activation of the OMT for Spain or for any of the countries,\" Vinals told Reuters. MIND THE FISCAL CLIFF European officials were keen to ensure their region was not the sole topic of discussion in Tokyo, where finance officials from around the globe have gathered for the semiannual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. Europe wants more attention placed on the difficulties Washington faces addressing its \"fiscal cliff\" of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect early next year unless the U.S. Congress acts. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the United States had a window of opportunity after its November 6 presidential election to negotiate a debt reform framework. Geithner said the magnitude of fiscal reforms that the United States needed to achieve debt sustainability was between 2 percent and 3 percent of gross domestic product, which he pointed out was \"a modest challenge relative to what most countries around the world face on the fiscal side.\" \"Our belief is that we can use the period between the election and the end of the year to negotiate a framework of reforms that can be phased in over time,\" he said. Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial nations - the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy, Britain, Germany and France - huddled during the afternoon to discuss their challenges, but did not issue a statement outlining their views. Japanese Finance Minister Koriki Jojima told reporters the G7 agreed the global recovery faced risks and that it had held in-depth discussions on monetary policy. But he declined to go into specifics. An official from the finance ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Europe was not in the firing line at the G7 meeting. \"It's not the case that the meeting was dominated by a sense of pessimism about Europe, or that there was a sense the region was not doing enough,\" the official said.

      " (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co's ( JPM.N ) chief financial officer, Doug Braunstein, may step down and take another position with the bank, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. \n",
      " The move would be the latest management change at the bank, which has been roiled by $6 billion of losses from bad bets on derivatives. The person familiar with the matter said any shift would be Braunstein's decision, and would be unrelated to the trades. In July, JPMorgan announced new co-heads for commercial and investment banking and named a co-chief operating officer. Analysts believed the steps were designed to add checks and balances to the bank's senior ranks after the trading losses, which have brought intense regulatory scrutiny to the bank. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters at the time that the shifts had been in the works before the bad trades, and were designed to help the bank cope with the increased complexity that financial companies face globally. Braunstein did not return a call to his cell phone seeking comment on his possible job change, and the bank declined to comment. The timing for any job change for Braunstein is unclear. The bank is set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday. The $6 billion of trading losses came from a JPMorgan group called the Chief Investment Office (CIO), which managed risk for the bank and invested deposits. The CIO group in London took large bets on derivatives, with one trader taking big enough positions to be called \"the London Whale.\" The bank first disclosed possible losses in May, and in July said that some traders may have lied about the value of their positions to the bank, adding fuel to government probes into the trades. Regulators and agencies including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are all looking at the bank. On Wednesday, Dimon told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, \"We made a stupid error. He added: \"I should have caught it ... I didn't.\" Even with the trading losses, JPMorgan Chase earned $5 billion in the second quarter. In narrative accounts of the bad trades by multiple media outlets, including a more-than-7,000 word piece published in this weekend's New York Times Magazine, Braunstein is not mentioned. JPMorgan said last week in an internal memo that Barry Zubrow was retiring. Zubrow was head of risk management at the bank when it was building a dangerously large position in credit derivatives. In January, months before the bank announced the bad derivatives trades, Zubrow switched to heading corporate and regulatory affairs. News of Braunstein's possible job switch was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. (Additional reporting by Sarah N. Lynch in Washington and David Henry in New York)\n"

      " The revised spending plan would be 3.3 percent higher than an initial 610 billion yuan tally announced last month, according to a bond prospectus published on www.chinabond.com.cn, the government's bond issuance website. The increase comes as the government tries to shield the world's second-largest economy from stiff global headwinds, including fast-tracking some infrastructure projects. The government has recently approved 25 rail projects that could be worth more than 700 billion yuan, as part of measures to stimulate the country's slowing economy. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its forecast on China's 2012 economic growth to 7.8 percent from 8 percent and warned of risks to emerging Asia if the euro zone crisis worsens and the United States does not avoid its \"fiscal cliff\". The Ministry of Railways said in September it would boost spending by 30 billion yuan to 610 billion yuan this year while it raised its target to 580 billion yuan by 12.4 percent in July. The government said on Wednesday it would increase state spending and offer tax breaks to quicken the development of the country's urban public transport system. However, China has cut planned railway investment by 500 billion yuan to 2.3 trillion yuan under a five-year plan to 2015, official media reported on Tuesday, but that may reflect spending cuts that have already occurred. China's rail investments slowed sharply in 2011 after a fatal high-speed train crash that led to the firing of the minister and some of the ministry's senior staff. But the government has been trying to boost investment since then, approving rail projects and giving the green light for the ministry to raise money through corporate bonds.

      " The pods are not licensed by Keurig or affiliated in any way, Kraft spokesman Basil Maglaris told Reuters. That means that Green Mountain will not receive any royalties from their sale. The move by Kraft, which also owns the rival Tassimo one-cup brewer, represents the first time a big-name coffee brand skirts Green Mountain in making cups for its market-leading system. Certain Green Mountain patents related to the design of its K-Cups expired in September. Maxwell House is the third-largest retail coffee brand in the United States behind No. 1 Folgers, which is owned by J.M. Smucker Co ( SJM.N ), and No. 2 Starbucks ( SBUX.O ), according to market research firm Euromonitor International. Following news of similar launches by private label brands including Kroger Co ( KR.N ), Safeway Inc ( SWY.N ) and Supervalu Inc ( SVU.N ), the move by Kraft adds more weight to the argument put forth last year by Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, who questioned the sustainability of Green Mountain's dominance in the single-serve market. Einhorn publicly disclosed a short position in the company a year ago. Aside from new K-cups coming to market, Green Mountain is also facing new competitors to its coffee brewers from the likes of Bunn, Starbucks and others. Starbucks Corp and Dunkin Brands Group Inc's ( DNKN.O ) Dunkin Donuts also sell cups for Keurig, but they are licensed. Maglaris said he expects the K-cups to be on U.S. retail shelves sometime in the next several months. Green Mountain was not immediately available to comment. Kraft also manufactures the Tassimo single-serve coffee system. Maglaris could not say whether the Keurig cups would cannibalize sales of single-serve discs used in Tassimo machines. Green Mountain shares initially fell as much as 3.4 percent on the news on Thursday, but by midday were up 0.3 percent at $22.14. Kraft shares were down 1.7 percent at $45.55.

      " ACCRA  (Reuters) - A court in Ghana upheld as legal on Thursday the detention of an Argentine naval vessel seized under a court order by creditors pursuing the South American nation over its 2002 debt default. \n",
      " Argentina declared a sovereign default a decade ago and now faces a raft of lawsuits in U.S. courts by bondholders seeking state asset freezes to recover the value of defaulted bonds. The Libertad, a navy frigate with 200 crew, was detained in Ghana's eastern port of Tema on October 2 under a court order sought by NML Capital Ltd, an affiliate of the investment firm Elliott Management. Argentina's defense ministry filed a motion contesting the detention claiming sovereign immunity. It said that, due to its military nature, the vessel could not be targeted by creditors. In its ruling the commercial court in Ghana's capital Accra said Argentina had forfeited such immunities when it issued the bonds. \"The defense applicant had made it so clear in the transaction agreement that it was waving such immunity and it is my view that the action being sought by the plaintiff is binding in accordance with the laws,\" the judge said in a statement. Ace Ankomah, a lawyer for NML Capital, told Reuters his clients were seeking a bond deposit worth at least $20 million before releasing the vessel. Argentina owed his clients \"well over $300 million\", he said. \"We are not insisting on cash payment, neither are we asking for the full amount. Our position is that we'd release the vessel if they are able to get a bank to issue the bond to us,\" Ankomah said. Bondholders like NML Capital, which the left-leaning government of President Cristina Fernandez calls vulture funds, normally target foreign bank accounts held by state-run companies or government agencies. Defense lawyers said the ship, which is used as a training vessel, was running low on fuel and appealed to the court to allow refueling to provide power for the crew, all of whom remain aboard. The Libertad was visiting Ghana as part of a west African tour. It is due to sail to Angola next. (Reporting by Kwasi Kpodo; Editing by Joe Bavier and  Robert Woodward )\n",

      " MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain is comfortable putting off an international aid request for weeks or even months as it waits out German political obstacles and seeks greater definition on the European Central Bank's bond-buying program, analysts and sources say. \n",
      " In the meantime, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is focusing on measures such as intensifying labor market reforms, as well as pushing for a European banking union that would help rebuild confidence in Spain's tarnished banking sector. Spain's borrowing costs spiked in July, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond jumped over an unsustainable 7 percent, but tumbled after ECB head Mario Draghi unveiled a bond-buying scheme to lower Spanish borrowing costs. Spain must first sign up for a European rescue plan to trigger the bond buying. Given its debt position, the Spanish government still sees that step as inevitable but pressure has eased as investors are less willing to bet against Spain with the ECB waiting in the wings. Germany has sent Spain strong signals that it should hold off because German Chancellor Angela Merkel is wary of presenting a fresh aid request to her parliament, euro zone sources say. Sources familiar with Rajoy's thinking say he also wants the ECB to indicate exactly what it will achieve with the bond-buying. Is the idea to avoid periodic volatility or to define a reasonable level for the risk premium on Spanish debt? they ask. \"We will end up there, with ECB action, but the ECB is still designing the instrument in more accurate terms,\" said a source close to the government. \"The markets understand that we have the fire extinguisher. We'll see how it evolves in the coming weeks.\" Turmoil over Greece, a fresh spike in Spanish yields or a credit rating downgrade to junk status for Spanish government bonds could accelerate the process, but for now Madrid is comfortable taking it slow, the source said. Spanish officials see more risks to moving ahead quickly without assured German backing, than in delaying a request. Meanwhile, they think things are moving in the right direction. For example, criticism of Draghi's plan has died down after strident objectives from European Central Bank Governing Council Member Jens Weidmann, who heads the German Bundesbank. \"We think that the current period of vacillation might last for several months if events don't intervene,\" Alex White, an economist with JP Morgan in London, wrote in a research note. White said he saw little on the horizon to change Germany's desire to avoid a Bundestag vote on Spain in the near-term. Then there is Rajoy's personality to consider. \"Rajoy has infinite patience to put up with tension where others would break down,\" said a senior banker in Spain. Although Rajoy has said he is studying conditions for seeking European aid, there is no mystery over what the European Commission would demand of Spain in terms of structural reforms and spending cuts. Euro zone sources have said conditions are likely to be largely in line with measures the country has already taken, since Spain would not be applying for a full rescue program that would cover all of its financing needs. The International Monetary Fund has sent a strong message to European policymakers to focus on growth even as they try to correct deficits, a line Spain applauds. With the economy in a deep recession and unemployment close to 25 percent, Spanish officials point out that ECB intervention might bring liquidity, but won't revive economic growth. \"With or without liquidity we have a growth problem globally, that we must start discussing,\" said the source close to the government. BANKING REFORM Rajoy has concentrated on moving forward with banking union -- under which the ECB would supervise European banks and the region would set up a deposit guarantee fund -- which he sees as key to improving Spanish banks' access to liquidity. After meeting French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday the two leaders called for rapid progress toward banking union [ID:nL6E8LAK52] at a European leaders' summit next week. However, Germany and others do not expect agreement even on cross-border supervision for a year or more. Originally, Spain was pushing for the banking union because it would have allowed the ESM rescue fund to directly recapitalize Spanish banks, keeping the cost of a financial sector rescue off the country's public accounts. However, Spain is less concerned about that impact now, since it estimates it will use only 40 billion euros of the 100 billion euros of bank rescue funds lined up, equivalent to only 4 points of gross domestic product. Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro calculated the deficit would swell to 7.4 percent of GDP this year when taking the bank rescue into account, but he said the European Commission would not consider that as non-compliance with targets, since it is a one-off. But banking union is still paramount for Spain since it would foster some confidence in its financial sector, which was crippled by a decade-long building boom that collapsed four years ago leaving the banks with 184 billion euros of bad debt. Rajoy has announced 65 billion euros in budget savings by the end of 2014 to try to bring Spain's deficit down drastically, in line with European Union targets. But rising unemployment, falling tax revenue and the recession are undermining his efforts. The Spanish government is acutely aware that next door, Portugal's severe spending cuts have failed to revive the economy. On Tuesday, in Luxembourg at a meeting of European finance ministers, Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said the euro zone believed Spain's budget cuts programme should take account of its recession. In Madrid, the source close to the government said under European rules if the government misses is deficit target because of recession, the European Commission would not apply sanctions for a missed deficit.

      "-- Thu Oct 11, 2012 6:25am EDT\n",

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Wednesday cut Spain's sovereign credit rating to BBB-minus, just above junk territory, citing a deepening economic recession that is limiting the government's policy options to arrest the slide. \n",
      " The S&P downgrade comes with a negative outlook reflecting the credit ratings agency's view that there are significant risks to economic growth and budgetary performance, plus a lack of clear direction in euro zone policies. \"In our view, the capacity of Spain's political institutions (both domestic and multilateral) to deal with the severe challenges posed by the current economic and financial crisis is declining,\" S&P said in a statement. S&P's two-notch downgrade from BBB-plus brings it in line with Moody's Investors Service's Baa3 rating. Moody's has Spain on review for a possible downgrade. Both firms have Spain just on the cusp of junk status. Fitch Ratings has a BBB rating on Spain, one notch higher, but also with a negative outlook. A spokeswoman at Spain's Economy Ministry told Reuters the government had no comment on the ratings action. The country has been in recession since earlier this year, its second economic contraction in just a few years, and unemployment is stubbornly high at close to 25 percent with a return to job creation still two years away. Falling tax revenue and rising costs of unemployment benefits are confounding the government's efforts to hit a 2012 deficit reduction target of 6.3 percent of gross domestic target agreed with the European Union. Both the International Monetary Fund and Spain's own Central Bank cast doubt on the savings envisioned in Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's 2013 budget, saying they are based on a too-rosy outlook for the economy. In the wake of the downgrade, the euro dropped about 0.25 percent to $1.2865 in late New York trade from just under $1.29 prior to the news. \"This is weighing on the euro. A downgrade from S&P could be followed by a downgrade from Moody's, and while S&P did not downgrade Spain to junk, Moody's might,\" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. \"If Moody's goes to junk status, that's even more significant, and this adds to the pressure on Moody's to make a decision. It could lead to higher bond yields in Spain and push the government closer to asking for a bailout,\" Lien added. In European trade earlier on Tuesday, ten-year Spanish bond yields fell 1 basis point to 5.83 percent. Those yields spiked above 7 percent earlier this year, but have since come down on a European Central Bank bond-buying plan. SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND EURO ZONE DOUBTS Prime Minister Rajoy's centre-right People's Party has an absolute majority in parliament and so far has been able to pass spending cuts and economic reforms without any problem. However, street protests have increased in recent months as Spaniards revolt against public sector wage cuts and lower spending on education and healthcare. Resentment is also rising over huge public bailouts for the country's crippled banks, while social benefits are cut. Although Rajoy's PP governs 11 of 17 Spanish regions, which have been forced to make massive budget cuts, S&P noted that tensions between the central and regional governments are rising, \"leading to substantially diluted policy outcomes.\" The agency said Rajoy's resolve will be \"repeatedly tested by domestic constituencies.\" Although the European Central Bank has set up a bond-buying program that would support Spanish debt prices on the secondary market, Spain has balked at signing up for international aid because it would come with harsh conditions. \"We view the Spanish government's hesitation to agree to a formal assistance program ... as potentially raising the downside risks to Spain's rating,\" S&P said in its note. The agency also said that euro zone policy makers must show progress on implementing a banking union that would allow Europe to directly recapitalize Spanish banks, taking the weight off of the Spanish government.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - In a tax fight that could jolt the real estate business, Howard Hughes Corp is challenging the U.S. Internal Revenue Service over a $144.1 million tax bill stemming from land sales at Summerlin, an enormous planned community in southern Nevada. \n",
      " The dispute centers on an accounting practice - known as the \"completed contract method\" - that the IRS has scrutinized for years. A Tax Court trial is scheduled for November 5 in Las Vegas. The IRS contends, according to court records, that Howard Hughes improperly deferred taxes on income from sales of residential lots at Summerlin, which sprawls across 35 square miles on the western fringe of Las Vegas. The company should pay taxes as it books the lot sales and not wait until the project is nearly finished, the IRS said. But Howard Hughes says its use of the method is permissible under an IRS exemption for home construction, and that developers pay up-front costs and do not know their ultimate taxable gains until a project is almost finished. Both the company and the IRS declined to comment. Dallas-based Howard Hughes is a spinoff from General Growth Properties. Though Howard Hughes is the company in court, General Growth is liable for tax payments if the IRS wins, according to the spinoff agreement. General Growth declined to comment. Activist investor William Ackman is chairman of Howard Hughes. Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management LP, owned 3.6 million Howard Hughes shares as of June 30. The IRS said in September 2009 that companies using the completed contract accounting method to defer income from land sales for years, or even a decade or more, could trigger an audit. The IRS has other Tax Court challenges pending with property developers over the completed contract method, or CCM. \"Taxpayers' misuse of the CCM is a growing trend within the residential construction industry,\" the IRS said in a September 2009 internal memo, one of several posted on the IRS website. HIGH STAKES FOR INDUSTRY An IRS win in Tax Court could mean property developers would need to pay taxes on a \"percentage-of-completion\" accounting method, a less-favorable approach for businesses. The IRS is \"taking a pretty hard-line position, saying that you just are not entitled to the completed-contract method,\" said David Auclair, principal at accounting firm Grant Thornton. \"This is a big issue for land developers and commercial real estate,\" he said. Homebuilders also use the completed contract method. In July, California-based Shea Homes LP went to trial with the IRS over this issue. The company could owe up to $61 million in federal and state taxes, Shea said in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Wilkes Graham, senior vice president at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC, said a court loss for Howard Hughes and General Growth would not deal a blow to their shareholders. But, he said, the challenge to the accounting method will be watched by other companies. \"It's a bigger deal overall,\" he said. For companies using the completed contract method, \"those entities would be at risk\" if the IRS wins, he said. Howard Hughes got a tax bill in February 2011 for allegedly under-paying taxes in 2007 and 2008 on Summerlin, a project that the company does not expect to sell out until 2039. Hurt by the recent financial crisis, Summerlin's acreage sales are starting to recover this year. The development's land covers an area half the size of the District of Columbia. As a developer, Howard Hughes builds the infrastructure at Summerlin - roads, sewer and water, electricity. The company makes money when it sells developed properties to home builders. A Tax Court loss by Howard Hughes would hurt the development industry just as it is starting to recover. Developers beginning new projects may need to pay taxes sooner, adding an up-front cost for the businesses, said Richard Shavell, a vice chairman at the Associated Builders and Contractors, an industry group. \"If the IRS wins, they could cause a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.

      " TOKYO  (Reuters) - Greece, Spain and the euro zone's slow progress toward debt reform take centre stage at IMF meetings on Friday despite Europe's best effort to remove itself from the spotlight. \n",
      " The International Monetary Fund recommended that some of Europe's debt-burdened countries take a bit more time to reduce budget deficits, arguing that moving too fast is counter-productive because it hurts the economy. But Germany, Europe's largest creditor country and the key to any lasting fiscal reforms, pushed back against that advice and said reversing course on promised deficit reductions would only weaken credibility. \"The euro zone does not lack the financial wherewithal to stem the crisis. What it lacks is the political will,\" former IMF official Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, wrote in the International Herald Tribune. While the IMF has advocated a slower approach to debt reduction, it urged swifter policy action, both in Europe and the United States, to remove economic uncertainty and help lift anemic global economic growth. \"We expect action, courageous and cooperative action on the part of our members,\" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said, spelling out her expectations for the twice-yearly meetings that start on Friday. In Europe, the IMF wants to see more progress toward promised reforms that would create a tighter fiscal and banking union. In the United States, the IMF has sounded the alarm over the \"fiscal cliff\" of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that take effect early next year unless Congress acts. European officials insist they are on track to deliver reforms, and want to see closer scrutiny of the U.S. fiscal issues instead. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Washington has a window of opportunity to address the fiscal cliff after the November 6 presidential election. Both topics will be on the agenda, along with the IMF's own internal reform efforts, which have stalled. The Fund was supposed to have completed by the Tokyo meetings a set of voting reforms that would give fast-growing emerging markets greater say in the international lender and vault China to the No. 3 spot. But U.S. presidential politics got in the way. The Obama administration is reluctant to seek congressional approval for additional IMF funding when the budget deficit is such a hot-button election issue. Without U.S. support, the IMF reforms lack sufficient votes to pass. (Additional reporting by Reuters IMF team; Writing by  Emily Kaiser ; Editing by  Tim Ahmann )\n",

      " WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court overturned a pretrial sales ban against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy Nexus smartphone, dealing a setback to Apple Inc in its battle against Google Inc's increasingly popular mobile software. \n",
      " Apple is waging war on several fronts against Google, whose Android software powers many of Samsung's devices. The ruling on Thursday from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is not expected to have an outsized impact on the smartphone market, as the Nexus is an aging product in Samsung's lineup. Apple's stock closed down nearly 2 percent at $628.10. However, the court's reasoning could make it much harder for companies that sue over patents get competitors' products pulled from the market, said Colleen Chien, a professor at Santa Clara Law school in Silicon Valley. Such sales injunctions have been a key for companies trying to increase their leverage in courtroom patent fights. \"The Federal Circuit has said, 'Wait a minute,'\" Chien said. Apple declined to comment, while Samsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple scored a sweeping legal victory over Samsung in August when a U.S. jury found Samsung had copied critical features of the hugely popular iPhone and iPad and awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages. The Nexus phone was not included in that trial, but is part of a tandem case Apple filed against Samsung earlier this year. District Judge Lucy Koh issued a pretrial injunction against the Nexus in June, based on an Apple patent for unified search capability. The appeals court then stayed that injunction until it could formally rule. In its opinion on Thursday, the Federal Circuit reversed the injunction entirely, saying that Koh abused her discretion. Apple failed to prove that consumers purchased the Samsung product because of the infringing technology, the appeals court ruled. \"It may very well be that the accused product would sell almost as well without incorporating the patented feature,\" the court wrote. \"And in that case, even if the competitive injury that results from selling the accused device is substantial, the harm that flows from the alleged infringement (the only harm that should count) is not.\" The court considered a single patent - one which allows the smartphone to search multiple data storage locations at once. For example, the smartphone could search the device's memory as well as the Internet with a single query. The appeals court has sent the case back to Koh for reconsideration. A separate pretrial sales ban Apple had managed to win against Samsung - targeting the Galaxy Tab 10.1 - was dissolved earlier this month after Samsung won at trial on that patent. Beyond the Nexus, Samsung also has a collection of new tablets and smartphones intended for launch before the holidays. On Wednesday, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt called the intensifying struggle between Apple and his company a \"defining fight\" for the future of the mobile industry. The case in the Federal Circuit is Apple Inc vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al., 12-1507. (Reporting By Diane Bartz; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick,  Bernard Orr )\n",

It might feel like an easy path at the moment but it will still leave a set of big questions hanging over the country. I don't think that will help.\" \"Our belief is that we can use the period between the election (on November 6) and the end of the year to negotiate a framework of reforms that can be phased in over time. The magnitude of policy reforms we have to agree on to achieve sustainability are somewhere between 2 to 3 percent of GDP. They're a very modest set of changes and if you do it in a balanced way with a mix of tax reforms ad spending cuts you can do a very good job of gradual reforms and still create some room for investments.\" GEITHNER ON EUROPE \"Even though they have a lot of details to work out, the agreement on that basic framework makes it much easier for Europe to navigate what is going to be a long difficult period of reform.\" GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLE \"There is no country in Europe which would give any thought to the question of abolishing the euro.\" \"I am convinced that we will be able to tell our friends and partners around the world that Europe is in the process of solving its problems and Europe is aware of its responsibility.\" \"We are convinced that in Germany and Europe it is of central importance ...that the public believes that there are reasons to trust the long-term foundations of our policies.\" \"Therefore, we believe that we will fulfill our international obligations with our policy of growth-friendly deficit reduction.\" SCHAEUBLE ON CONSOLIDATION'S NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GROWTH \"One should also consider the advantages of the common currency. No one was forced to become a member of the European monetary union. \"Greece has repeatedly made clear that it does whatever it can to stay in the monetary union. And when Greece wants that and implements measures, no one will force Greece out of the euro zone.\" SCHAEUBLE ON IMF SUGGESTION GERMANY STIMULATE DOMESTIC DEMAND \"Such suggestions reveal not so great knowledge about Germany's situation. Domestic demand does rise in Germany.\" \"We are the growth engine of Europe and we believe it is not helpful when one creates an impression that there are solutions that would be easier.\" \"I don't believe in criticizing others. That's cheap. It would be much more reasonable when others would solve their problems and Europeans theirs.\" \"The IMF has said time and again that high public debt poses a problem. So when there is a certain medium-term goal, it doesn't build confidence when one starts by going in a different direction.\" \"When you want to climb a big mountain and you start climbing down, then the mountain will get even higher.\" JAPAN FINANCE MINISTER KORIKI JOJIMA ON FISCAL STIMULUS \"The government will do the utmost to ensure financial market stability in the near term and we need to take fiscal measures to stimulate the economy as needed. In the medium to long term, we need to tackle fiscal discipline and economic growth as a pair of wheels. As Europe's debt crisis clearly shows, once fiscal policy loses market confidence, it would cause a vicious cycle of a spike in government bond yields and worsening of public finances.\" \"Rebuilding public finances is a common task for developed countries ... Japan has enacted a law to increase the sales tax to 10 percent as part of effort to achieve prime budget balance by fiscal 2020/21 ... and this shows our stance of sincerely adhering to our promise to international society.\" JOJIMA ON CURRENCIES: \"Despite the fragile economic fundamentals, a strong yen is continuing. I told (IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde) about our concern that further yen gains would pose major downside risks to the Japanese economy, which is recovering from (last year's) earthquake. Managing Director Lagarde told me that the yen is somewhat overvalued.\" JOJIMA ON EUROPE AND CHINA (after the G7 meeting): \"I said it is important for Europe to fulfill its responsibility to steadily carry out agreed steps and that I expect that will ensure market stability.\" \"Chinese economy is slowing down but there's room for fiscal and monetary policy steps to achieve its growth target of 7.5 percent. There occasionally arise difficult problems between Japan and China as we are neighbors, but Japan-China economic relationship is close and (there is) interdependence, and I believe its smooth development is important for development of Asia and the world economy.\" JOJIMA ON EUROPE (from the text of a speech prepared for the meetings) \"The debt and financial-sector problems in Europe pose the biggest downside risk to the global economy. Europe must make its own efforts to prevent the spread of the crisis and to stabilize the market. First of all, it is important to quickly put into operation the measures that have been agreed on and announced to date.\" \"The currency unification in Europe is an ongoing magnificent experiment in history. We hope that European countries will overcome conflicts in opinions and strengthen their efforts to unite together and establish a monetary union in the true meaning. Japan is ready to make contributions as necessary while keeping watch on these European efforts.\" JOJIMA ON S.KOREA COOPERATION \"I discussed with South Korean minister Bahk the global and regional economic situation. We agreed that both countries would cooperate in the framework of the G20 and ASEAN 3 and that our finance authorities will closely work with each other on the economic and financial front. We shared the view that the enhanced bilateral currency swap agreement was beneficial over the past year and that we are ending it this month as planned. We also agreed that we will hold the next bilateral finance dialogue at an appropriate time.\" WORLD BANK'S KIM ON WORLD'S POOR: \"We are in challenging times. Food prices remain high and volatile, growth in high income countries is weak, and developing countries, which have been the engine of growth, will not be immune the increased uncertainty in the global economy.\" \"The economic announcements emanating in recent weeks have been sobering. Everyone is vulnerable in times of uncertainty but especially the poor who have few, if any safety nets and resources, and live from day to day.\" IMF CHIEF CHRISTINE LAGARDE CALLS FOR POLICY ACTION \"We expect action and we expect courageous and cooperative action on the part of our members.\" \"Whether you turn to Europe to the United States of America to other places as well, there is a level of uncertainty that is hampering decision makers from investing from creating jobs ... We need action to lift the veil of uncertainty.\" LAGARDE ON EUROPE DEBT CRISIS AND U.S. 'FISCAL CLIFF' \"There are threats on the horizon, threats that can be addressed, should be addressed but are not necessarily addressed. Here I'm talking about ... the policy decisions that should be taken within the euro zone, in particular, and policy decisions that should be made in the United States of America to address the issue of 'fiscal cliff' and debt ceiling.\" LAGARDE ON TOP CHINESE OFFICIALS NOT ATTENDING MEETINGS \"All economic partners in this region are very critical for the global economy. Certainly at the IMF, where we encourage cooperation ... we hope that differences no matter how longstanding can be resolved harmoniously and expeditiously and can be beneficial not only to those countries ... but also to the global economy.\" LAGARDE ON TALKS WITH EGYPT TOWARD IMF PROGRAM \"As you know, one of your (Egypt) authorities indicated he was hoping for closure in the middle of next month. Fingers crossed ... I am very confident we can discuss productively, reach agreement, and help Egypt as much as we can.\" LAGARDE ON EFFORTS BY EURO ZONE TO DEAL WITH DEBT CRISIS \"As is often the case with the euro zone, there is good news and bad news. Good news is the fact that this European Stability Mechanism that had been discussed and in the making for the last months has now been christened ... That is the good news. In terms of speed, the bad news is that for it to actually operate there will be a legislative and often parliamentary process for the fund to effectively work.\" LAGARDE ON IMF'S ROLE IN EUROPE \"We are flexible but when we monitor we want to know that what we monitor is something that we are comfortable with, that makes sense from an economic point of view, which means that we also want to participate in the design.\" BANK OF JAPAN GOVERNOR MASAAKI SHIRAKAWA \"The outlook for the global economy is very difficult, so I hope to discuss the risks to the outlook at the IMF meeting.\" \"It is unfortunate that People's Bank of China Governor Zhou did not attend (this week's meetings). But my understanding is that the deputy governor is leading China's delegation here. Japan and China have close economic ties and I hope to continue communicating with the PBOC.\" \"When explaining Japan's economic outlook, currencies are a big part of that, so from that standpoint I want to explain our monetary policy at the G7.\" ECB GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER EWALD NOWOTNY \"The ECB assumes that we'll have a lower inflation rate next year, below 2 percent. \"The ECB does not commit itself to future policy but my personal view is that at the moment I don't see any need to change the interest rate policy.\" \"Realistically, I hope that there will be a legislative basis for the European banking supervision but in terms of operations I don't think it will be in place before mid-2013.\" FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD CHAIRMAN MARK CARNEY \"There are signs that reforms ... in euro zone countries are starting to improve their competitiveness and their current account. It is important that the current momentum is not lost...\" \"The core of the global banking system has substantially improved their (global systemically important financial institutions') capitalization and I would say liquidity. But there are regions of the global economy where that is not the case.\" \"(FSB) members expressed concern about unresolved issues in the cross-border application of regulation (of derivatives). They called on jurisdictions to put in place their legislation and regulation promptly and to act by end of 2012 to identify and address conflicts, inconsistencies and gaps in their national frameworks.\" BRAZIL FINANCE MINISTER GUIDO MANTEGA \"When it comes to European countries, our view is that they're taking the correct measures, that the instruments being built are adequate, namely the common banking supervision and a fiscal union, or the European Stability Mechanism.\" \"But the problem is that these instruments are still not being used and implemented. Implementation keeps being delayed.\" (Reporting by Reuters IMF and World Bank reporting team)\n"

      " (Reuters) - Carlyle Group LP co-founder David Rubenstein said President Barack Obama's economic plans are not anti-business, countering criticism from his Republican rival Mitt Romney, who like Rubenstein is a veteran of the private equity business. \n",
      " While Obama has come under attack for his health care plan and corporate tax policies - criticized as harmful to business - the administration has not turned a blind eye to CEOs, Rubenstein, Carlyle's co-chief executive, said in an interview on October 2 with Reuters TV host Robert Wolf, the former Wall Street executive and outside Obama advisor. \"Obama had reached out to the business community, they just haven't liked all of his decisions and some of his rhetoric,\" said Rubenstein, a former White House aide in the Carter administration. \"But generally I think the administration is quite open and accessible.\" His background notwithstanding, Rubenstein denied any party affiliation. \"I don't really try to get involved politically by giving money to politicians or by saying I'm a Democrat or Republican,\" he said. \"Right now, I just view myself as an American.\" Rubenstein worked with the Obama administration earlier this summer, when Carlyle formed a joint venture with Sunoco to save a Philadelphia oil refinery set to close. \"The people at the White House did help, and we were very pleased with it,\" he said. Rubenstein also pointed to the fiscal cliff - the year-end expiration of tax cuts and triggering of spending cuts - as a major cause of uncertainty within the business community. \"Everywhere I go in the world, people care about the fiscal cliff,\" he said. \"It's not like many things that get overly dramatized.\" However, Rubenstein said it is unlikely the lame-duck Congress will make any sweeping changes. \"We'll probably kick it down the road for six months to give the next president and the next Congress an opportunity to really focus on it,\" he said. During the interview, Rubenstein touched on several other topics, including Carlyle's aggressive dealmaking this year. The firm has made several large acquisitions in the last quarter alone, including photo agency Getty Images for $3.3 billion, DuPont Co's auto paint unit for $4.9 billion and investment manager TCW Group. Going forward, Carlyle is interested in continuing to make acquisitions in emerging markets. \"The emerging markets will probably not grow as much as they have, but China, India and Brazil are great countries in which to invest,\" he said.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. unemployment remains \"painfully high\" while inflation is not an immediate concern, giving the Federal Reserve plenty of reason to launch a new stimulus last month, a top Fed official said on Thursday. \n",
      " Jeremy Stein, in his first keynote speech since becoming a Fed governor in May, said he strongly supported the U.S. central bank's decision to embark on a new, open-ended bond-buying program. His comments suggest that despite cries of foul from a handful of hawkish regional Fed bank presidents, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke had solid backing for the third round of quantitative easing, or QE3, announced in September. Stein said the plan was needed to boost an economy that was growing too slowly to bring down the nation's unemployment rate, currently at 7.8 percent. \"It appears that the economy is growing at a pace such that, absent policy action, progress on reducing unemployment will likely be slow for some time,\" Stein told an event at the Brookings Institution. \"Given where we are, and what we know, I firmly believe that this decision was the right one.\" U.S. economic growth registered a paltry 1.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter and economists polled by Reuters see a still anemic 1.7 percent clip for the third quarter. Stein offered a detailed explanation of how he estimates the effect of the new asset purchases will help economic growth. The purchases kick off with $40 billion per month in mortgage-bond buying. He estimated a hypothetical $500 billion in Treasury purchases would lower yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes by about 0.15-0.20 percentage point. Stein added there was a boost to stock prices and corporate bond markets as well. But he said there was an even deeper impact from the psychological boost to confidence among consumers and businesses. \"(The) overall impact of (asset buys) may be augmented via a signaling or confidence channel,\" Stein said. Describing some of the potential costs of unorthodox monetary easing from the Fed, Stein concluded - like the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee - that the risks are manageable and worth taking. He said the Fed has the tools and the will to raise interest rates if inflation becomes a problem. FED ON BUBBLE WATCH Stein said the Fed is cognizant of the possibility that low interest rates could lead to asset bubbles by forcing investors to take undue risks, and that the Fed would monitor such prospects closely. But he added current conditions offer little cause for alarm, arguing low rates may actually contribute to financial stability by making it easier for firms to rely less heavily on short-term financing. He pushed back against the notion that the Fed might be shooting for higher inflation, saying this would risk the central bank's credibility without offering any obvious benefits. \"I disagree with the premise that what we're doing is seeking to gin up inflation,\" Stein said in response to questions from the audience. Stein also dismissed the notion that easy monetary policy only helps wealthy individuals by boosting stock prices. On balance, lower income earners tend to have higher debt levels, he said, and are therefore net beneficiaries of the Fed's ultra-low rates. He acknowledged that the weakening of the dollar that tends to accompany the Fed's monetary stimulus is of some benefit to economic growth but argued that this is not a dominant channel through which Fed policy affects the economy. In response to the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-2009, the Fed cut official rates to effectively zero and more than tripled its balance sheet to around $2.8 trillion.

      " AVONDALE, Penn.  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's stated intention to keep interest rates ultra low for nearly three more years is suggesting to some that the Fed is willing to cut the jobless rate at the expense of higher inflation, putting the central bank's credibility at risk, a top official of the U.S. central bank said on Thursday \n",
      " Charles Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed and one of the most hawkish of the Fed's 19 policymakers, in a speech on Thursday weighed in on the simmering debate over just how high U.S. monetary policymakers would allow inflation to rise in order to boost weak economic growth and lower unemployment. The debate has amplified - both among Fed policymakers and outside economists - since the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last month launched a third and potentially massive round of asset purchases and said it expected to keep short-term borrowing costs near zero through mid-2015. Plosser, in the text of a speech, said keeping the federal funds rate so low for so long \"would risk destabilizing inflation expectations and lead to an unwanted\" rise in inflation. \"In fact, some are interpreting the FOMC's statement that we will keep accommodation in place for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens as an indication that the Fed is focused on trying to lower the unemployment rate and is willing to tolerate higher inflation to do so,\" he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Southern Chester County Chamber of Commerce, in Avondale, Pennsylvania. \"This is another risk to the hard-won credibility the institution has built up over many years, which, if lost, will undermine economic stability,\" he said. U.S. economic growth cooled in the second quarter to a tepid 1.3 percent annual rate, and forecasters do not think the economy is expanding much faster now. Though unemployment fell sharply to 7.8 percent last month, from 8.1 percent in August, analysts doubt that improvement can be sustained. Inflation, meanwhile, has remained relatively stable near the Fed's 2 percent target for almost three years. It is now tracking slightly below that target. Since the Fed's latest easing move, three of Plosser's colleagues - Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Narayana Kocherlakota of Minneapolis and John Williams of San Francisco - have each specified how high above 2 percent they would allow inflation to rise before tightening policy. Economic theory suggests that higher inflation expectations have the same impact as easier monetary policy: lowering inflation-adjusted \"real\" interest rates, and encouraging borrowing, investment and hiring. \"We know that monetary policy can control inflation, but its ability to manage the unemployment rate is far more dubious,\" said Plosser, who does not have a vote this year on Fed policy. \"Chasing an elusive goal for unemployment could well risk losing control over inflation,\" he added. \"That was the lesson of the Great Inflation during the 1970s.\" (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n",

      " BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Asian economies will likely register another year of weak growth in 2013, despite pockets of mild recovery expected in some countries as central banks continue to keep policy accommodative, a Reuters poll showed. \n",
      " But much will hinge on whether China, Asia's largest economy, can pull out of its downtrend this year, if the U.S. economy can continue to gain traction and if the euro zone can contain its prolonged debt crisis. Forecasts for nearly all of the 12 economies polled in October were downgraded from the last quarterly poll conducted in July. \"Next year will probably be quite a difficult year for most Asian economies,\" said Vishnu Varthan, economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank. \"A lot of these economies still have their umbilical cords tied to China and whether China eases policy and its magnitude will probably decide the course of growth in the region.\" After starting off 2012 in relatively good shape compared to their Western peers, one Asian economy after another began quickly succumbing to the global downdraft as the year progressed and demand for the region's exports deteriorated in the United States, Europe and then China. China is scheduled to publish third-quarter GDP data next week, with investors anticipating a seventh straight quarter of slowing growth, and economists were reluctant to make fresh forecasts so close to the release date as they run the risk of having to immediately revise their assumptions. The last Reuters poll of economists four weeks ago was taken in the wake of weaker-than-expected data for August and revealed a sharp cut to their third-quarter growth call to 7.4 percent year-on-year from a 7.9 percent consensus forecast just two months earlier. Investors have repeatedly pushed back their expectations of when China's economy would hit the bottom of the current growth cycle. The consensus view at the start of 2012 was that the first quarter would be the nadir. It has since moved to the third quarter, with the economy set for its slowest full year of growth since 1999. Reuters polls also showed that Asia's second-largest economy, Japan, is stumbling and likely shrank in the third quarter as the slowdown in China and the euro zone's woes take a bigger toll on the export-reliant nation than previously anticipated. The economy is expected to grow just 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter after a predicted 0.1 percent contraction in the third quarter, the poll of 26 economists taken October 2-9 showed. For the full year to March 2013, the economy is expected to grow 1.7 percent, revised down from a 1.8 percent expansion projected last month, and the lowest estimate since the first forecast in February 2011. The poll also saw a slightly lowered growth forecast for the next fiscal year to 1.4 percent from a 1.5 percent expansion in the previous survey. Graphic for the poll:  link.reuters.com/vub59s WORST OVER FOR INDIA? But economists said the worst may be over for India's economy, with one big proviso: the federal government must continue to push through and stick to politically unpopular reforms. The Reuters poll showed India's growth slump has likely passed and the economy will gradually recover over the next year, though the rate of expansion for this fiscal year will still be the weakest in a decade. GDP in Asia's third-largest economy will likely grow 6.6 percent in the fiscal year to March 2014, after expected 5.7 percent growth in this fiscal year. That compared to 6.3 percent and 7.0 percent growth predicted in the last poll in July. Optimism has risen since New Delhi announced a slew of reforms last month to mend the government's finances, but economists warned that failure to stick to the path of reforms will likely throw the country back into a period of low growth. LIQUID OPTIMISM Hopes for a turnaround beginning in the fourth quarter have been influenced by several factors. Optimism in world financial markets has shown some improvement after the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank agreed to launch new rounds of bond buying to help boost their fragile economies and reignite global growth. \"Tail risks to global growth has been substantially mitigated by the decisive action of the ECB and Fed,\" said Wai Ho Leong, economist at Barclays. Attention has also focused on more encouraging though still erratic economic data from the United States, although nothing so far is pointing to anything more than a sluggish recovery. The U.S. is now expected to grow at less than 2 percent over the remaining months of the year, while the euro zone will likely find itself mired in recession for some time. That is unlikely to bode well for Asia's export-driven economies such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, all of which have slashed growth forecasts for both this year and next. POCKETS OF RECOVERY Australia and New Zealand, two of Asia's largest commodity driven economies, are expected to grow at a slightly faster pace this year. \"There will still be quite a bit of tiering within Asian economies. Depending on where commodity prices are going that will impact how Australia, the Philippines (and others) grow,\" said Varthan. With growth in focus and inflation expected to remain relatively subdued, most central banks in the region are expected to keep policy accommodative into 2013. The poll showed most central banks will likely keep interest rates on hold in coming months, though India's central bank is expected to cut its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points by December. South Korea's central bank cut rates on Thursday for the second time in four months, as expected, while Indonesia kept rates unchanged at a record low while conceding that domestic demand, while still robust, was not as high as expected as the global downturn drags on.

      " HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Apple Inc's largest contract manufacturer has been pushing for a Chinese worker left brain-damaged in a factory accident to be removed from hospital in a case that throws a harsh new spotlight on labor rights in China. \n",
      " Zhang Tingzhen, 26, an employee of Taiwan firm Foxconn, had nearly half his brain surgically removed after surviving an electric shock at a plant in southern China a year ago. He remains in hospital under close observation by doctors, unable to speak or walk properly. However, Foxconn, which is paying Zhang's hospital bills, has been sending telephone text messages to his family since July, demanding they remove him from hospital and threatening to cut off funding for his treatment - a move the firm says would be justified under Chinese labor law. Foxconn confirmed it had sent the messages, saying that under Chinese law the worker must submit himself to a disability assessment - a process that in Zhang's case would require him to be discharged from the Shenzhen hospital and travel 70 km (43 miles) to Huizhou, where he was first hired by Foxconn. The firm said in response to emailed questions that it would be prepared to return Zhang to the Shenzhen hospital after the assessment, though his father said Zhang was unfit to travel and that doctors felt he remained at risk of a brain haemorrhage. The case has raised fresh questions over the labor record of Foxconn, one of the biggest and most high-profile private employers in China, after a series of well-publicized suicides among its army of around a million workers and recent outbursts of labor unrest. It has angered labor activists who say Zhang's plight also highlights China's patchy and sometimes precarious welfare system for workers seriously injured in industrial accidents - and point out that there are many workers worse off than Zhang. \"They kept sending me SMSs every day to get my son out of hospital and to appear before an injury assessment body or they will stop paying all expenses, including his medical fees and our living expenses,\" said Zhang's father, Zhang Guangde. \"You cannot imagine the suffering they put me through, how I had to fight every inch of the way just to get money so we can take care of our son,\" he added, speaking at his son's bedside at the Number 2 People's Hospital in Shenzhen. Zhang was repairing a spotlight on an external wall at a Foxconn factory in Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, when he received an electric shock and fell four meters (12 feet) to the ground. He has since undergone five operations, has lost his memory, is incontinent and requires careful, regular monitoring. 'ROBBED OF DIGNITY' Workers who are disabled in workplace accidents and covered by insurance are eligible for compensation payouts, once their disability is assessed and graded by a panel of medical experts. The assessment is done after medical treatment is finished. Foxconn sent the text messages, and according to Zhang's father at one point briefly halted payments to the family, despite a provincial law stipulating that injured workers can remain in treatment for up to two years before they must be assessed for disability compensation. The company, however, denied that it delayed or stopped payments, saying it paid them on time. Zhang, whose case was alerted to Reuters by labor activists, has been in hospital since October 2011. Doctors at the Number 2 People's Hospital declined to comment for this article, but Zhang's father, 50, said they had not indicated that he could be discharged and had said they needed to keep his son under observation after implanting a tube in his body to drain fluid from his brain cavity to his bladder. \"The doctor told me they needed to monitor his condition and that for such serious injuries, a person was allowed to be treated in hospital for up to two years. After that, assessors can order treatment to be prolonged,\" the father said. Labor activists in China say Zhang is just one of many thousands of Chinese workers who are left permanently disabled or chronically ill by workplace accidents, at the mercy of a system that often requires them and their families to fight degrading battles for treatment funding and compensation. \"China now has laws specifying the types of compensation that are due to workers. But in many serious industrial accidents, companies still put workers or their families through a lot of suffering just to get what is due to them,\" said Choi Suet-wah of the Chinese Working Women Network in Hong Kong. \"They are robbed of their dignity,\" said Choi, who has extensive experience working with migrant workers in China. Zhang is actually one of the lucky ones, social workers say, pointing out that Foxconn has at least been paying his hospital bills and the living expenses of his family, which has moved to Shenzhen from central China to be with him. They estimate that at least four out of 10 Chinese workers are not covered by any kind of insurance and are left to fend for themselves when seriously injured in the workplace - despite laws requiring all employers to insure their workers. \"This is just one of many, many industrial accidents in China. And you almost certainly never get what you are entitled to, especially in serious cases,\" Choi said. WELFARE BORDERS Foxconn says it is insured against workplace accidents, which means its insurer would meet the cost of a compensation payment once Zhang's disability is finally assessed. But compensation in China can vary depending on the city in which a worker's disability is assessed - and this, according to Zhang's family, is why Foxconn wants him to travel to Huizhou and refuses to have him assessed in Shenzhen. Labor activists say wages and compensation levels are all substantially lower in Huizhou than in Shenzhen, one of the most expensive cities in China. When asked why Zhang could not be assessed in Shenzhen, Foxconn said the law required him to go to Huizhou because he had signed his employment contract there. It added that it was prepared to send him back to the hospital in Shenzhen if the assessors determined that he required more medical attention. In hospital, Zhang walks unsteadily, holding on to the bed frames of other patients in his shared room and, with a smile, sits down next to his father whose face tightens with emotion. \"He calls me 'mother' and calls my wife 'father'. He can only mimic words you ask him to say, it is meaningless,\" the elder Zhang said later, holding a jar containing large fragments of his son's cranium. Doctors replaced a portion of Zhang's skull with synthetic bone. He said that despite Foxconn's funding - a monthly allowance of 11,000 yuan ($1,800) plus treatment costs - the family had racked up 200,000 yuan ($31,800) in debt to pay for medicines not provided by the hospital and other expenses. Back home in central Henan province, the family was building a house for Zhang to live in after his impending marriage when he was injured. \"We were building a three-storey house,\" the elder Zhang said. \"The project has since been abandoned and all the building materials we bought have been washed away by rain. But these workers still have to be paid. My whole life is over.\" (Additional reporting by China bureau; Editing by  Mark Bendeich  and  Nick Macfie )\n"

      " NEW YORK/HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Oil major BP Plc has secured U.S. government permission to ship U.S. crude oil to Canada, and Royal Dutch Shell has applied for an export license, as rising production in the world's top oil consumer upends global energy flows. \n",
      " A surge in output from shale oil reserves in the Bakken of North Dakota and Eagle Ford of Texas has raised U.S. domestic production to the highest level since 1995, light, sweet crude that could fetch better prices on international markets. The United States still imports more than 8 million barrels per day, making it the world's biggest importer. BP Plc received a crude export license this summer from the Bureau of Industry and Security, a branch of the US Commerce Department, to ship crude oil to Canada, a source familiar with the issue said on Thursday. BP has yet to export any crude oil on that license, the source said. \"We have applied to the Department of Commerce to export domestic U.S. crude oil,\" Shell spokeswoman Kayla Macke told Reuters, adding that as a global commodity, imports and exports would follow supply and demand. Macke declined to comment on the likely export destinations or the volumes of crude involved. A nearly century-old U.S. law requires companies to get a special license to export crude oil. Until recently, there has been no demand for overseas shipments, apart from a trickle of crude from Alaska that has been routinely exported. The Financial Times first reported the news, saying Swiss-based trading firm Vitol applied for a license, citing people familiar with the matter. \"Other than routine movement between Canada and the United States, we have not been involved in any crude oil export requests,\" a Vitol spokesman said. Experts say some U.S. crude oil has routinely moved through Canada or has been refined over the border, but must be reimported to the United States. The FT said the Department of Commerce refused to confirm or deny the existence of license applications or licenses, but quoted the DOC as saying exports to Canada had a \"presumption of approval\". But domestic U.S. refiners, especially on the Gulf Coast, were built to process cheaper, heavier types of crude from Mexico or Saudi Arabia, and are often ill-suited for refining the lighter crudes and natural gas liquids created by the U.S. boom in hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking'.

      " BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The creation of a unified European airspace is seriously off track, potentially requiring the European Union to use sanctions to force compliance from member states, European Commissioner for Transport Siim Kallas said in Cyprus on Thursday. \n",
      " Although the European Union dissolved customs borders and passport controls for much of the continent years ago, control of the skies overhead remains fragmented between nations. \"We have fallen seriously behind in our original ambitions. After more than 10 years, the core problems remain the same,\" Kallas told a conference in Limassol. \"At this stage, it looks like infringements may well be necessary,\" Kallas said. The Single European Sky II package is an EU plan to scale down from 27 national airspaces to nine regional blocks by December, with the ultimate aim of one single air control system. But countries have been slow to dismantle domestic air traffic monopolies in order to form the regional blocks, and the EU may launch investigations into sanctioning countries who won't make good on the agreement. The Commission can force member states to follow EU law through a procedure known as infringement, which begins with a formal demand and can escalate into EU court action and fines. According to the EU's executive, the European Commission, the patchwork control of Europe's airspace leads to more than 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in extra costs per year that gets passed on to passengers. Air traffic control costs make up 6-12 percent of the cost of an airline ticket. Kallas said the price paid in the EU for using antiquated 1950's-era systems makes the bloc uncompetitive. The EU was \"a long way off the price in the United States...which already controls the same airspace area with more traffic at half the cost,\" he said. Full implementation of the EU single sky plan would triple the amount of capacity for flights and improve safety tenfold, the Commission said. Due to the national control of airspaces, flights also have to take longer and more inefficient routes, adding an extra 42 kilometers to each flight in Europe. This in turn results in wasted fuel and increased emissions. ($1 = 0.7754 euros) (Editing by  Hugh Lawson )\n",

      " BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Union's top official fleshed out his ideas for a separate budget for euro zone countries on Thursday, and indirectly warned British Prime Minister David Cameron about using the proposal for his own political gain. \n",
      " At a conference to discuss the state of Europe after nearly three years of debt and financial crisis, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said a separate euro zone budget was an idea that needed close examination. Even if it is a long-term project and there are a host of political and financial obstacles to overcome, it could help underpin the stability of the single currency, he said. \"We have to do everything to stabilize the situation in the euro zone, and if a fiscal capacity or a separate budget can help and can contribute to this stability, then you have to reflect on it, to discuss it,\" he told conference delegates, who included several ministers from EU member states. \"Every currency union needs also a fiscal capacity, and certainly a fiscal capacity to stabilize the euro zone.\" The 27 countries in the European Union currently finance a budget which amounts to around 130 billion euros a year - 1 percent of EU output - and which is used for spending on agriculture, science, infrastructure and other areas. But there is no equivalent budget among the 17 countries that share the euro, a shortcoming that many economists believe has undermined the stability of the currency project. Van Rompuy first raised the possibility of a separate euro zone budget in September and developed his thinking in a document sent to EU capitals in early October. It forms part of a series of initiatives to try to resolve the debt crisis. Germany and France strongly support the proposal and, in a surprise to many EU diplomats, Britain does too, but for different reasons. Cameron sees a euro zone budget as a way of further separating Britain and its increasingly EU-skeptical electorate from the currency bloc and its problems. He also sees a euro zone fund as a way of potentially reducing the amount Britain has to pay into the EU budget, which is negotiated annually as part of a seven-year framework. The issue has become particularly acute as the EU prepares to negotiate the next seven-year plan at a summit in November, a deal Cameron has threatened to veto unless he gets his way. \"There will come a time when you need to have two European budgets, one for the single currency, because they are going to have to support each other more, and perhaps a wider budget for everybody else,\" Cameron said on Sunday, the first day of his Conservative Party's annual conference. Asked if he was prepared to block the long-term EU budget if spending wasn't cut further, Cameron replied: \"If we cannot get a deal that has proper control of that budget, if they put forward ideas for massive increases, I won't say yes to it.\" TOUGH NEGOTIATION The concern for Van Rompuy and others is that Cameron is combining very early discussions on the possibility of a euro zone fund with negotiations on the EU budget, and by doing so putting both processes at risk. \"I want to clear out any confusion - this must not be mixed up with the European Union's multi-annual budget,\" Van Rompuy told the \"Friends of Europe\" conference. \"Since we decide on a multi-annual financial framework in November, it is important that we don't start mixing up that discussion with the embryonic idea\" of a euro zone budget. \"The objectives are different and the timeframes are completely, completely different,\" he said, adding that those who try to mix the two should be careful. But beyond trying to keep Cameron from muddying the waters, Van Rompuy also faces a battle to try to convince the European Commission and several euro zone member states that having a separate budget for them is a good idea. Van Rompuy's thinking - firmly backed by Germany - is that some form of \"fiscal capacity\" among the euro-area countries will allow them to iron out labor market and other socio-economic imbalances that build up in the bloc. The fund could be used to help a country such as Spain, which has unemployment of 25 percent and is struggling to reinvigorate growth. In exchange for budget rigor, the pan-euro zone fund could provide targeted assistance. \"The fiscal capacity could perform stabilizing functions specific to the euro zone, for instance help countries absorb asymmetric shocks over economic cycles, so we limit the adjustment cost in terms of growth and employment,\" Van Rompuy said. \"This would also make the euro area as a whole more resilient.\" While economically it may make sense, politically it is likely to prove challenging to convince all 17 countries that they need to pay more into a fund they hope they never need.

      " SANAA  (Reuters) - Masked gunmen shot dead a Yemeni man who worked in the security office of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa on Thursday, in an attack a Yemeni security source said appeared to be the work of al Qaeda. \n",
      " The incident was the latest of a wave of attacks on officials in the impoverished Arab state, which is battling Islamist militants with Washington's help. The attackers, on a motorcycle, opened fire on Qassem Aqlan - who headed an embassy security investigation team - near his house in the center of Yemen's capital, the source told Reuters. \"This operation has the fingerprints of al Qaeda which carried out similar operations before,\" said the source, who asked not to be named. Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and other militant groups strengthened their grip on parts of the country during an uprising that ousted veteran President Ali Abdullah Saleh in February. Washington, wary of the growing power of al Qaeda, has stepped up drone strikes on suspected militants, with the backing of Saleh's successor, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. A neighbor who identified himself only as Fahad said he had noticed strangers roaming the streets over the past three days, suggesting Aqlan was being watched before the attack. \"Once he (Aqlan) stepped out of his house the men shouted his name and when he replied, they shot him in the head and neck,\" he said. Aqlan, who was in his 50s and had worked at the embassy for more than a decade, was responsible for coordinating security information between the U.S. Embassy and the Yemeni authorities, the source added. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that his main duties included conducting personnel checks as head of the \"foreign service national investigative unit\" and serving as a liaison with Yemeni security services. He worked within the office of the embassy's \"regional security officer,\" who is responsible protecting the embassy, its personnel and information. She also said initial reports that he was involved in the investigation into the attack last month on the U.S. Embassy by protesters angry over an anti-Islam film made in the United States were incorrect. \"We condemn this vicious act in the strongest terms,\" the spokeswoman said but declined to comment on who may have been behind the attack or why Aqlan may have been targeted, saying it may or may not have had anything to do with his work. There have been a number of killings and assassination attempts on security officials and politicians since Yemen's army drove Islamist fighters out of several southern towns earlier this year. Last month Abdulilah Al-Ashwal, a senior intelligence official, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Sanaa. Restoring stability in Yemen has become an international priority due to fears that al Qaeda could become further entrenched in a country which flanks oil producer Saudi Arabia and lies along major international shipping lanes. AQAP, regarded as al Qaeda's strongest regional wing, has mounted operations in Saudi Arabia and tried to launch attacks against the United States.

In September, the lawmakers postponed Mersch's appointment indefinitely by putting off the cross-examination in protest at what they called \"systemic\" bias against women.

      " SINGAPORE/LONDON  (Reuters) - Indonesia's powerful Bakrie family has proposed splitting from financier Nat Rothschild and Bumi Plc, the London-listed miner they co-founded two years ago, after news of an inquiry into possible wrongdoing strained their already tense relations. \n",
      " The dramatic plan put to board directors and key investors on Wednesday night would see the Bakries taking back their Indonesian assets with deals worth an estimated $1.38 billion. If their share swap and cash purchases proceed, they would exit Bumi Plc and dismantle the company they created with Rothschild, drawing a line under the family's ill-fated London venture. The potential unraveling of Bumi Plc ( BUMIP.L ), one of the world's largest thermal coal exporters, is a bitter blow to Rothschild, who staked his reputation on the investment and the model behind it. It also marks the potential end of a miner that has become emblematic of institutional investor concerns over governance at foreign resources firms listed in London. \"The Bakrie family agreed to create Bumi Plc as a way to expand their interests, their reputation,\" one source familiar with the situation said. \"In the end, it's been nothing but trouble.\" Tensions have been rising between Bumi's shareholders, exacerbated last month by an announcement from the London-listed miner that it was launching a probe into potential wrongdoing at its Indonesian coal mining operations, including PT Bumi Resources ( BUMI.JK ), the jewel in the Bakrie crown. It is unclear whether the Bakrie proposal will allow the probe, being led by London lawyers, to proceed. It had been expected to be completed within weeks. \"For the Bakries, they will do anything to defend Bumi Resources,\" said a Bakrie insider who was aware of the proposal. Under the offer, the Bakrie family would cancel their indirect stake in the London-listed group, around 23.8 percent. In exchange, they would get 10.3 percent of PT Bumi Resources, out of a stake of just over 29 percent currently held by the London firm. The Bakries would then buy the remaining 18.9 percent of shares for cash, before Christmas 2012. The Bakries have also made a conditional proposal to buy out Bumi Plc's 84.7 percent stake in PT Berau Coal Energy ( BRAU.JK ), an associated Indonesian coal miner, within the next six months. The news boosted Bumi's volatile shares, after months of steep losses driven by boardroom rows, Bakrie family debts and tumbling coal prices. \"Yes, it is an acknowledgement (of defeat),\" said one source close to the situation, who added it would be difficult for Bumi Plc to work in Indonesia having split from the Bakries. \"No one would want to start from here, but given where we are, this is far from being the worst option.\" END OF THE AFFAIR The Bakries - advised by Ian Hannam, the former JP Morgan banker who masterminded the creation of Bumi Plc two years ago -- outlined a scheme that would leave the London firm without operating assets and back at square one as an investment shell. Bumi Plc's board is now considering the offer and will consult with top investors. \"We are disappointed because there are some absolutely fantastic assets in Indonesia,\" said one top-10 investor in Bumi Plc, lamenting the loss of \"beautifully located\" assets, but pointing to an outcome which could please bruised investors. \"This was a stock that was 150 pence before recent events - the current proposal, if the Bakries have the money to go through with it, would lead to potential return of just under 5 pounds a share according to our calculations,\" he said. \"From out point of view, that is a disappointing outcome, but it is not as catastrophic as it was.\" Bumi Plc's volatile shares were up 41 at 262 pence in afternoon trade after the proposal, still far from peaks of over 12 pounds hit in June last year. Jakarta-listed shares in PT Bumi Resources ended up almost 6 percent. London brokerage Numis said it might be time for the shareholders to cut their losses. \"Valuation aside, this looks like good news for Bumi Plc, in our view, as it could walk away with its reputation intact and some cash in the bank,\" Numis analysts said. \"Losing its main assets would be a disappointment, but given the soggy coal markets and dark cloud surrounding the company, this might be a good way to move on.\" Details on financing arrangements for the Bakries were not disclosed, though a Bakrie spokesman said the London market underestimated the group's financial power, dismissing speculation that the family would not be able to complete the deal - leaving Bumi Plc with Berau, a smaller share in PT Bumi Resources and difficult working conditions in Indonesia. People close to the deal said the Bakries were preparing to borrow up to half the amount required for the deal, possibly through financing arranged by Credit Suisse. Dileep Srivastava, director and corporate secretary for PT Bumi Resources, said the proposal could be a win for all sides. \"We are focused on operational excellence: to reach 100 million metric tonnes (110.23 tons) production in 2014, deleverage and cut interest charges... thereby (unlocking) our intrinsic value - without distractions,\" he said. SINGAPORE MEETING The Bakrie proposal came just before Bumi's board met on Thursday on the 8th floor of Singapore's Mandarin Orchard hotel. This included Rothschild, Indra Bakrie - one of the Bakrie brothers - and Samin Tan, an Indonesian billionaire who pulled the Bakries back from default last year with a $1 billion investment, only to watch the value of his shares crumble. The Bakries and Tan each hold half of a 47.6 percent stake in Bumi Plc, while Rothschild owns 12 percent. The relationship between Rothschild and the Bakries, one of Indonesia's most powerful and politically connected families, has soured since the London group's inception, particularly after a leaked letter from the financier last November that called for a \"radical clean-up\" in PT Bumi Resources. But relations have also frayed between the Bakries and Tan. Sources have said Tan is \"furious\" with the Bakries after watching the value of his investment plunge. There was no immediate word on the Bakrie proposal from Tan. But a source close to the Bakrie family said the deal was a \"clear message of separation with Tan\". The Bakries also urged Rothschild to return shares he received as payment for the successful acquisition of the Bakrie assets, arguing Thursday's proposals reversed that deal. Rothschild, for his part, said he expected the probe into alleged wrongdoing to complete. He pointed to continued challenges for Bumi, including from shareholders still linked to Bakries, after months of struggling to implement \"appropriate standards of corporate governance\".

      " BERLIN  (Reuters) - Bentley and Lamborghini's plans to develop ultra-luxury SUVs may be put on hold to save cash for parent Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), company sources said, in a sign that the crisis is beginning to bite even for the German auto giant. \n",
      " U.K.-based Bentley and the Italian supercar maker rolled out extravagant concept sport utility vehicles (SUV) at the auto shows in Geneva and Beijing this year, with production awaiting approval by VW's management board. The push towards off-roaders is aimed at boosting profitability at Lamborghini, loss-making since 2009, and Bentley. The move has dismayed Lamborghini purists who fear that expanding to four-by-fours will dilute the brand's exclusivity. Grappling with unforeseen production cuts and slowing auto sales, VW may postpone the models as it reviews planned spending on equipment, factories and vehicles due to be ratified by VW's supervisory board on November 23, two company sources said. \"Such vehicles are anything but obligatory during a crisis,\" said Frankfurt-based Equinet AG analyst Tim Schuldt. \"Delaying their launch would be no drama but help save costs.\" VW, on course to overtake U.S. rival General Motors ( GM.N ) as the world's second-biggest carmaker behind Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), has outperformed the European market this year. The German company's eight-month EU-wide sales were flat at 2.05 million cars, compared with a 7.1 percent drop to 8.27 million vehicles for the 27-nation region's market. The Wolfsburg-based maker of the Golf hatchback said on Tuesday that sales at its flagship passenger car brand rose just 4.3 percent to 492,500 vehicles in September, the smallest gain in eight months. VW halted production in Germany of its Passat model for two days last week as part of a wider move to cut group output by about 300,000 vehicles to 9.4 million cars this year. That would be up on last year's output of 8.5 million but short of the goal originally set for 2012 of about 9.7 million, company sources said on October 5. Finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch signaled at the Paris auto show that the slump in European demand could spark further austerity measures at VW. \"In this environment, we need to have a considerable amount of liquidity available,\" Poetsch said on September 26. \"It's normal that one looks for items that aren't imperative,\" he added, referring to investments that could potentially be pushed back. Bentley and Lamborghini would be up against stiff new competition with their plush SUVs; Fiat's ( FIA.MI ) Maserati will start production next year of the Jeep-based Kubang, while UK-based Land Rover will launch the new Range Rover Sport in 2014. Ferrari has had a family car, the FF, its biggest model, in its range since last year. The two VW divisions aim to replicate Porsche's success with the Cayenne SUV, which now accounts for half the sports-car maker's deliveries. But exorbitant pricing, fierce competition and a limited pool of buyers in markets such as China may restrain their sales, according to research firm IHS Automotive. IHS said production of the Bentley SUV, scheduled to start in late 2014, might peak at fewer than 4,000 cars in 2016, while the Lamborghini Urus could reach a maximum of fewer than 2,400 in 2018, a year after the model started rolling off the line. \"It'll be tough to turn the models into sustainable business cases,\" Frankfurt-based IHS analyst Henner Lehne said. Bentley could not confirm that its first-ever SUV, code-named EXP 9-F, would be delayed. It will continue to push for the model to get the nod from VW's leadership, spokeswoman Kerstin Sachl said on Wednesday, adding the British carmaker was hoping for a decision by the end of the year. Lamborghini chief executive Stephan Winkelmann told Reuters on September 27 that while VW has yet to sign off on the Urus, the Italian manufacturer would continue with the model's development.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Next year offers only a slight improvement for a global economy hit by recession in Europe and slowing or moribund growth in Asia and the United States, according to Reuters polls of hundreds economists worldwide. \n",
      " After reaching 3.1 percent this year, world economic growth is expected to hit 3.4 percent in 2013, polls released on Thursday said - a slight cut from July's poll and slower than the International Monetary Fund's latest forecasts of 3.3 percent and 3.6 percent. While few expected 2012 would be anything other than a difficult year for the world economy, there had earlier been some hope a resilient United States and faster-growing emerging markets would keep up the momentum. This view has changed with economists polled over the last week saying at least some of the weakness will inevitably spill into next year. Much will hinge on whether China, Asia's largest economy, can pull out of its downtrend this year, and if the euro zone can contain its prolonged debt crisis. \"As we've moved further through 2012, the assumption we've generally worked off - that next year's got to be better than this - is fading rapidly,\" said Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec in London. She cited a few big risks for next year, including the prospect of deep automatic spending cuts in the United States, the so-called fiscal cliff, which would immediately crimp on growth unless politicians agree a deal to avert it. \"We think they'll find some sort of compromise on that. But there are plenty of smaller drags on global growth through next year - there's no question the euro crisis is going to continue,\" said Clarke. Europe is expected to remain the biggest drag on the world economy next year, as its sovereign debt crisis continues to stew. The predicted five worst performing economies in 2013, out of the 19 covered in the poll, are all European, with Italy bottom of the stack. And the euro zone economy may have to wait until 2014 before it recovers from its decline this year, as few analysts polled by Reuters expect anything other than feeble growth in the quarters ahead. Only 17 of 71 economists polled said it will grow enough next year to cancel out the 0.5 percent decline predicted for 2012. The consensus was for 2013 growth of just 0.3 percent next year, in line with last month's poll. The survey suggested recent aggressive action taken by the European Central Bank will not alone be enough to put the euro zone back on a sound economic footing. Still, easy monetary policy elsewhere in the world should help foster better growth, without really propelling it. NEW YEAR HANGOVER Prospects for the United States, the world's biggest economy, have dimmed only slightly for the first part of next year, suggesting it will maintain its plodding recovery. Economists cut their median growth forecast to an annualized 1.6 percent for the first quarter of 2013, compared with 1.7 percent last month, and to 2.1 percent for the second quarter from 2.3 percent. \"I don't think we are going to get significantly slower from here but that depends on what happens in fiscal policy towards the end of the year,\" said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The poll showed the vast majority of economists - 29 of 31 -believe politicians will agree to stop January's automatic trigger of $600 billion of tax hikes and spending cuts. That would avoid precipitating what the Congressional Budget Office has warned could be \"a significant recession\" and the loss of about 2 million jobs, a scenario already suffered by some major European economies. Europe's slump has cast a big shadow over export-reliant Asian economies, which will likely register another year of weak growth in 2013. Forecasts for nearly all of the 12 Asian economies polled in October were downgraded from the last quarterly poll conducted in July. \"Next year will probably be quite a difficult year for most Asian economies,\" said Vishnu Varthan, economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank. \"A lot of these economies still have their umbilical cords tied to China and whether China eases policy and its magnitude will probably decide the course of growth in the region.\" China is scheduled to publish third-quarter GDP data next week, with investors anticipating a seventh straight quarter of slowing growth. Still, the likes of India and Indonesia will remain among the world's fastest growing major economies next year.

      " ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's biggest company, Coca Cola Hellenic, is leaving the country, the drinks bottler said on Thursday as its move to Switzerland and a London listing for its shares dealt a blow to the crippled Greek economy. \n",
      " The immediate material impact on Greece is limited - its Greek plants stay open and CCH HLBr.AT said the small portion of it activity that the world's second-ranked Coke bottler has in Greece will be unaffected. But analysts quickly saw it as bad news for a nation struggling to compete inside the euro zone. CCH, which has said it fears the Greek crisis could disrupt its multinational business, said in a bourse filing in Athens that shareholders, most of whom are abroad, will exchange their stock for shares in Coca Cola HBC AG, based in Switzerland and effectively shorn of the Greek tag \"Hellenic\". That stock will be primarily quoted on London's LSE. \"A primary listing on Europe's biggest and most liquid stock exchange reflects better the international character of Coca Cola Hellenic's business activities and shareholder base,\" the company said in its regulatory statement. The firm, in which The Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) of the United States has a 23-percent stake, bottles Coke and other produce in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria. About 95 percent of its shareholders and business activity are outside Greece. \"This transaction makes clear business sense,\" chief executive Dimitris Lois told analysts in a conference call. An overwhelming majority of shareholders have already accepted moving a company which has long complained about Greek taxes. Analyst Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities in Athens said that the move made sense for the firm, which follows Greek dairy group FAGE this month in seeking a low-tax, low-volatility haven for its corporate base - in FAGE's case Luxembourg. \"The Greek bourse is losing a very good company and the London Stock Exchange is gaining a very important group,\" said Hatzidakis. \"It's very bad news for the Greek economy and bourse.\" For brokers on the stock exchange, losing a stock that made up 8 percent of daily turnover this year will be unwelcome - especially since total volumes are down by half since last year. For the Greek treasury, the loss of tax revenue is unclear. Though CCH officials did not detail tax savings from moving the registered office to Switzerland, it has complained of high - and increasingly unpredictable - taxation in crisis-hit Athens. But the move may further discourage investment in Greece. Trade unionists saw the corporate exodus as immoral and one, Stathis Anestis, spokesman for the biggest labor group GSEE, suggested a boycott of Coke : \"This is unacceptable,\" he said. \"CCH and FAGE are speculating at the most crucial moment for the Greek economy and the Greek people. Consumers should use their power to punish these companies.\" COUNTRY RISK One analyst said CCH, which rose to the top of corporate rankings as the values of Greek banks collapsed, was out to rid its share price of such risks associated with Greece; the country is mired in recession and facing mass discontent as its leaders slash budgets to meet international creditors' terms for loans intended to keep Athens inside Europe's single currency. \"This is a healthy company that does not want to suffer from Greece's high country risk,\" said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign investors have been steadily reducing their investment in the Athens Stock Exchange  .ATG  since the country was engulfed by the sovereign debt crisis in 2009. Greece's future in the 17-nation euro zone still remains in doubt. Aided by the fact that it is doing most of its business outside Greece, CCH consistently outperformed the general Athens stock market index, which has slumped to 20-year lows. CCH has become the country's biggest firm by market value with a capitalization of around 6 billion euros ($7.7 billion), representing about a fifth of the Athens bourse's total. The company, which last year made net profit of 330 million euros on sales of 6.85 billion, has complained of taxes imposed under Greek government austerity measures. A U.S. filing shows it paid about 20 million euros in both 2009 and 2010 for one-off \"social responsibility\" levies in Greece. Profits at operating units in other countries are generally taxed locally. The Greek parent company reported 32 million euros in Greek taxes in 2010 and none last year. New withholding tax on dividends in Greece might have affected CCH in future. In its U.S. filing for 2011, the company said: \"Greece, which accounted for approximately 6 percent of our unit case sales volume and approximately 8 percent of our net sales revenue in 2011, is currently facing a severe economic crisis resulting from significant government fiscal deficits and high levels of government borrowing.\" \"The ... Greek government debt crisis may have impacts on our liquidity that currently cannot be predicted.\" CCH said it would delist from the Athens Stock Exchange and then seek to re-enter that bourse with a secondary listing. Coca Cola Hellenic shares closed down 4.9 percent at 15.66 euros in Athens. Analysts explained the drop by the low cash price of 13.58 euros the company is offering to those shareholders who refuse the offer of new Swiss shares.

      " (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn offered to buy all the outstanding shares of Oshkosh Corp ( OSK.N ) Thursday for a 21-percent premium to the U.S. truckmaker's closing price on Wednesday, sending its shares to their highest in more than a year. \n",
      " Icahn, the company's largest shareholder with a 9.45 percent stake, said the only condition on his $32.50-a-share offer was that shareholders elect a slate of directors whom he will nominate to the company's board. \"Mismanagement of this company has resulted in a lost decade of shareholder value,\" Icahn said in a statement. \"Oshkosh needs proactive shareholders to bring a proactive management team together to weather a volatile economy.\" Oshkosh said its board would advise shareholders of its position on the offer within 10 business days, and suggested that shareholders not act on the offer until the board has reviewed it. Oshkosh shareholders had, in January, voted down an Icahn-backed slate of directors. Shares of the company surged 12 percent to $29.98 on the news, earlier hitting $31.30, their highest since July 2011. \"It's not an unattractive price by any means, but it's surely not a fully valued price,\" said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst who covers Oshkosh at Longbow Research. Lustgarten has a \"buy\" rating on Oshkosh with a $34 target price. Profit at the Oshkosh, Wisconsin-based company slumped about 36 percent through the first nine months of its recently ended fiscal year, hurt by declines at its military-vehicle unit. Last month, Oshkosh management met with analysts and laid out a plan to double annual profit by 2015, helped by cost costs and strong growth at its JLG aerial-lift arm. In August, Icahn told Reuters he believed Oshkosh should spin off JLG, which it acquired in 2006 for $3 billion. NAVISTAR RISES Oshkosh is not Icahn's only big holding in the U.S. trucking sector. He is also the third-largest shareholder of Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ), with a 14.94 percent stake. Icahn proposed merging the two companies last year, a move supported by former Navistar Chief Executive Daniel, but opposed by Oshkosh. Navistar shares rose 6 percent to $23.34. \"People are thinking that with Icahn involved in both, there's an opportunity to put them together and generate some shareholder value,\" said David Leiker, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co who covers Navistar. Leiker said he didn't see a lot of sense in combining the two companies. While both make military trucks, they assemble them in different ways, he said, adding, \"It's like bicycles and cars.\" A spokeswoman for Navistar, which in late August replaced Ustian with former Textron Inc ( TXT.N ) CEO Lewis Campbell, declined to comment. Last week, Icahn was victorious in his campaign at Navistar when the maker of International-brand trucks agreed to accept Icahn associate, Vincent Intrieri, to its board. The company also agreed to accept another shareholder, Mark Rachesky, as a director and to take on one other director nominated by the two investors. SHAREHOLDER VOTE Oshkosh shareholders' rejection in January of Icahn's director nominees has not deterred the billionaire, who is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management shake-ups or sales. Icahn urged Oshkosh in August to spin off its JLG aerial-lift unit to shareholders, saying that business, which Oshkosh bought in 2006 for $3 billion, would do better on its own. In a statement Thursday, he said that, once officially made, his tender offer would expire in 45 days, but that if at least 25 percent of the company's outstanding shares were sold to him, he would extend it. Should he be able to boost his stake to 50.1 percent, Icahn added, \"we will demand that the current board ... accelerate the upcoming annual meeting to allow the prompt election of our slate of directors so that the tender offer can close quickly.\" Oshkosh shares have risen some 52 percent over the past year, while Navistar's have declined 39 percent. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  has risen 10 percent. (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by  Bernadette Baum )\n"

      " TOKYO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Japanese wireless service provider Softbank Corp is looking to buy roughly 70 percent of Sprint Nextel Corp in a bold move that would make it a major player in the U.S. mobile market. \n",
      " But Softbank's ambitions may not stop with Sprint, which might also be looking to buy out its partner, Clearwire Corp. The Japanese company might also be aiming to use Sprint as a vehicle to make a run at smaller Sprint peer MetroPCS Communications Inc, a two-step transaction that would potentially cost more than 2 trillion yen ($25.55 billion), according to a Nikkei report. That would make it the biggest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company ever and vault Softbank into the upper echelons of wireless carriers worldwide. In response to reports of a pending deal, Sprint said on Thursday that it was in talks with Softbank on a \"potential substantial investment\" that could involve a change in control of the U.S. company. It said there was no assurance of a sale. Softbank is eyeing a controlling stake in Sprint worth more than 1 trillion yen ($12.8 billion) and is in talks with several banks to borrow money to finance a bid, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. A second source familiar with the situation, who would not speak on the matter publicly, said Softbank was after a stake of roughly 70 percent, which it could achieve by buying some newly issued shares directly from Sprint and tendering for the rest. By raising some new equity directly, Sprint would be able to shore up its balance sheet and potentially fund other deals such as a buyout of Clearwire in which it already holds roughly 48 percent. Sprint shares rose as much as 19 percent on Thursday to levels not seen since the summer of 2011, on the heaviest trading volume in the stock's history. The stock ultimately closed 14.3 percent higher at $5.76 on New York Stock Exchange. The shares of Clearwire, which could play a key role in any deal, closed almost 71 percent higher at $2.22. Clearwire, which has been looking for new sources of funding, has said that it has enough money until at least the middle of 2013. It declined to comment on Thursday and its chief financial officer pulled out of a conference presentation at the last minute without an explanation. A major Sprint investor said any Softbank investment should be used to buy out the rest of Clearwire, to give Sprint attractive wireless spectrum assets and to speed up Clearwire's upgrade of its wireless network with faster data speeds. \"I just don't think there's any deal unless it involves Clearwire. I don't think you'd see one without the other,\" said Daniel Martino, a fund manager at T. Rowe Price, which owned 47.2 million Sprint shares as of the end of June. DEALS MULTIPLYING Sprint, whose market capitalization was $15.12 billion at Wednesday's market close, is the third-largest U.S. carrier, with more than 56 million users at the end of June, even after losing customers for years. As for Softbank, Sprint might be its only option for an entrance into the U.S. market, according to analysts. \"In terms of (Sprint) standalone, we believe the asset represents the only way for a potential new entrant to get a national presence immediately in the U.S.,\" Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a note to clients. The Softbank news comes just days after a source told Reuters that Sprint has been considering bidding for MetroPCS, which agreed this month to merge with Deutsche Telekom AG's and NTT Docomo. Japanese media said buying Sprint - which competes in the United States against Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc - would also make it cheaper for Softbank to procure smartphones and other mobile devices. Benjamin Powell, a former general counsel to the director of national intelligence now in private practice at WilmerHale, said the deal was very likely to require a government review because it involved sensitive telecommunications networks. But several analysts said regulators were likely to eventually look favorably on a deal. Japanese companies made a record 642 cross-border deals last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Buoyed by a stronger yen, the value of all overseas deals rose to $69.5 billion, up 81 percent from 2010, also a record.

      " In a short statement, the British armaments manufacturer said it was trading in line with expectations but that it could face some limited trading disruption in the United States in the final quarter of 2012, as the government in Washington tries to pare the federal deficit. U.S. sales account for nearly half of BAE's revenue. \"We are obviously disappointed that we were unable to reach an acceptable agreement with our various government stakeholders,\" BAE Chief Executive Ian King said of the failed deal to merge with European Airbus manufacturer EADS that would have created the world's biggest aerospace and defense group. \"However, our business remains strong and financially robust. We continue to see opportunities across our platforms and services offerings and in the various international markets in which we operate.\" Talking to reporters on Wednesday, King had played up the company's opportunities outside the United States and Britain, naming Saudi Arabia and Oman as two areas of growth. The group said on Thursday it expected modest growth in overall underlying earnings per share for 2012, but this assumed a satisfactory conclusion to pricing negotiations this year with the Saudi government on the Typhoon Salam program to supply the Gulf kingdom with Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighters. It is also in talks with Oman to supply aircraft and support for them. And it has secured a contract win in South Korea, which it sees as a key market with potential for further deals.

      " Investors are keen to hear management make its case and explain how Europe's biggest defense contractor plans to keep growing when governments are cutting back on their military spending. \"We want to sit down with the company to talk through exactly why they wanted to do this deal, and now that it won't be going ahead, what are the plans,\" said one of BAE's top 20 shareholders. \"They implied this was a strategic necessity, and now they say this setback is fine and that they can carry on as normal. Well, which is it?\" Investors contacted by Reuters after the proposed deal fell through said BAE's management has said it will meet them, possibly within days, to outline its plans. Earlier this week fund manager Invesco, BAE's biggest shareholder with more than 13 percent of the company, fired a broadside at the company in an attempt to sink the merger, citing concerns over state interference, poor terms and lack of strategic rationale. But now the deal is off the table many of the investors said they remained supportive of BAE's managers but still expect to see a robust plan for the company's future, and will not settle for pledges to find an alternative suitor, perhaps in the United States as a solution to its immediate challenges. \"They need to be clear now. The last thing you want to hear is they're just going to wait for a better suitor to come over the hill. You want them to be actively managing the business and getting on with the day-to-day business of winning more international contracts,\" said another leading shareholder. A number of investors said management were owed a modest amount of credit for engaging EADS ( EAD.PA ) in what they saw as an ambitious attempt to fulfill obligations to investors and explore all possible ways of generating value for shareholders. One major shareholder said he had supported the principle of the merger with the owner of Airbus as an effective way to meet BAE's challenge of diversifying away from its current dependence on the weakening defense sector. The failure of the deal is therefore an ominous sign for the company, he noted. \"BAE are left in a tricky position ... Consolidation would seem sensible in the face of such difficulties, but as we have seen, this is not going to be easy to achieve,\" he said. None of the investors contacted by Reuters demanded an immediate management overhaul following the deal's collapse but indicated that Chief Executive Ian King and Chairman Dick Olver face a tough few weeks in trying to restore their credibility and avoid a vote of no confidence at the next shareholder meeting. \"Until you sit down with the company, you cannot make those kinds of judgments on whether the chairman should stay or go ... So we'll hold fire, talk to the company and then decide how we feel about it,\" the first investor said. (Editing by Greg Mahlich)\n",

      " The United States said last month it had complied with an order to withdraw subsidies to Boeing after the WTO found in March that the U.S. planemaker had received billions of dollars in unfair aid. But the European Commission, the EU's executive, said Washington has shown no proof it has complied. \"It is now clear for the European Union that the United States has not only failed to properly implement the decision of the WTO but it has even provided new subsidies to Boeing,\" the Commission said in a statement. The Commission said U.S. subsidies were costing European aerospace companies billions of euros in lost revenue. Recent U.S.-EU talks failed to resolve this dispute, the Commission said. \"The US claimed to have removed (the subsidies), but provided no detailed evidence to support its claims,\" it said. The U.S. Trade Representative's office said it had met a deadline to comply with the WTO's findings in a case brought by the European Union. That was in response to the first claim launched by the United States more than seven years ago. Brussels says Boeing is unfairly assisted by government research deals and other federal and local measures. The WTO has also ruled against European support to Airbus, which is owned by EADS ( EAD.PA ), in which the French government has a stake and the German government has influence via a holding owned by Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ). In the row, the United States and the European Union disagree over the ruling against subsidies to Airbus, which the United States says far outstrip any U.S. government support for Boeing. The United States has also accused the European Union of ignoring WTO decisions and is threatening up to $10 billion in sanctions. However, most observers expect both sides to eventually negotiate a settlement to end the row. (Reporting by  Robin Emmott ; editing by  John O'Donnell )\n",

      " WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The collapse of the proposed merger between BAE Systems Plc and EADS will shift the focus to smaller deals among global weapons makers as companies strive to keep revenue rising in the face of cuts in military spending by the United States and Europe. \n",
      " Industry executives and bankers do not see other mega-deals on the horizon for now, after the $45 billion UK-French-German talks collapsed on Wednesday. The failure showed how easily a deal of that scale can be derailed by competing interests of different countries, despite commercial logic. Instead, major defense companies likely will focus on possible combinations with smaller players such as Rockwell Collins, L-3 Communications Holdings Inc, SAIC Inc, ITT Exelis and Harris Corp, according to interviews with more than a dozen industry executives and bankers. \"None of the big players in the global defense industry seem inclined to do mega-mergers similar to the BAE-EADS proposal,\" said Loren Thompson, a Washington-based defense consultant who has advised BAE's U.S. unit and its competitors. \"The American companies are all at a place where they're not eager to grow in defense and are basically trying to secure their base, while the overseas companies have been chastened in watching the BAE-EADS transaction falter.\" It is also unlikely that big U.S. prime defense contractors would bid for BAE Systems, even though the company is considered potentially \"in play\" after the failed merger, because of the potential complexity, these people said. EADS said it would continue its aggressive hunt for takeover targets and alliances, especially with U.S. partners, though on a smaller scale than the BAE deal. EADS North America Chief Executive Sean O'Keefe said on Wednesday that EADS remained \"undeterred\" in its drive to increase its share of the U.S. defense market. BAE's U.S. unit said it, too, would keep looking for possible mergers in the areas of cyber, intelligence, security, electronics and international businesses. The scope of consolidation in the defense industry still hinges largely on how the U.S. Congress deals with $1.2 billion in mandatory budget cuts slated to start in 2013. Half of those cuts are for defense, and as long as those reductions threaten, mergers and acquisitions are expected to remain slow. Worldwide aerospace and defense deals have totaled $5 billion so far in 2012, compared with $27.5 billion in all of 2011, when United Technology's $16.5 billion takeover of Goodrich boosted the total. This year's total also appears low compared with $6.7 billion in deals in 2010. The effort by BAE and EADS to create the world's biggest aerospace and defense group underscored the effect of shrinking markets on big weapons makers. Many other major companies are scrambling to move into adjacent civilian or commercial markets, or find smaller takeover targets to keep revenues growing, bankers and senior industry executives said. \"Second-tier consolidation is much easier because the Defense Department is not against it,\" said a banker who requested anonymity, because he is not authorized to speak to the media. \"Had the EADS-BAE deal gone through and created a stronger global entity, clearly it would have increased the likelihood of U.S. consolidation at the prime level,\" said the banker. \"The chances seem lower in the absence of the deal.\" The U.S. Department of Defense has discouraged mergers among the leading U.S. prime contractors, but has said it is fully expecting takeovers, mergers and other actions among second- and third-tier suppliers, given the expected decline in defense spending in coming years. A Pentagon official said last month that the department would have to rethink its views on top-tier mergers if Congress is unable to avert another $500 billion massive military spending cuts on top of the $487 billion in cuts already slated for the next decade. NEW BAE DANCE PARTNER? Almost all prime U.S. defense contractors considered merging with BAE Systems at various points in the past, and decided against it, several people familiar with the companies' thinking said. Most were interested in BAE's North American operations and they remain wary of adding political risk that would come with being the UK government's prime contractor by pursuing the whole company, they said. \"There had been conversations for decades,\" said a senior industry adviser on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media. \"But buying the whole BAE, with golden share and other things like dual-listing, dual-incorporation structure, U.S. guys say it's not worth it.\" For its part, BAE Systems has repeatedly said it has no intention of selling the U.S. unit, which contributes more than half of the company's revenue. BAE officials made clear in recent weeks that any move by the U.S. government to require divestitures as a condition for approving a merger with EADS would have been a deal-breaker. Some sources cautioned that a new round of merger considerations involving BAE cannot be ruled out, given the challenging defense environment. But most potential U.S. bidders have their own reasons for why the deal would not make sense right now. Executives at Lockheed Martin Corp have said privately that they have no plans to pursue BAE, which is a key supplier on its troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. They say the company is squarely focused on its performance on the F-35, the Pentagon's largest weapons program, and does not need the distraction of integrating a major acquisition. Boeing Co is more focused on its booming commercial business and expanding its position in the cyber and unmanned systems areas at the moment, according to company executives and analysts. Raytheon Co's Chief Executive William Swanson has publicly discussed the immense challenges involved in absorbing such a large, complex company. Northrop Grumman Corp just sold two units, including its lackluster shipbuilding business, to streamline the company, making an acquisition highly unlikely, according to company insiders. Chief Executive Wes Bush is more focused on creating a high-performing defense company and maintaining profit margins, not acquiring a company whose revenues have been hard hit by the downturn in demand for ground combat vehicles, according to analysts and company executives. Any combination with General Dynamics Corp could raise antitrust issues, since the General Dynamics and BAE both build the biggest U.S. combat vehicles, and on a global scale, submarines. General Dynamics also is changing management, with Phebe Novakovic slated to take over as chief executive in January. The company has highlighted the importance of its balanced portfolio of commercial and military businesses, and may be reluctant to add more defense activities to its portfolio at a time when military spending is declining, analysts said. Pentagon officials were open to a possible merger of BAE and EADS because it would have created a stronger, sixth prime competitor. But the agency could be more wary of a deal that involved a combination with one of the existing primes, some industry executives said.

      " Spending cuts reduced the budget gap to 12.6 billion euros ($16.3 billion) from 20.1 billion in the same period last year. The figures exclude key elements of the general government budget, which is the one used by the European Union to assess Greece's fiscal performance under an EU/IMF bailout program. Mired in recession, Greece is struggling to meet the targets set under two bailouts since 2010 totaling more than 200 billion euros ($258.03 billion). Despite fierce tax hikes, net government revenue stagnated at 36.7 billion euros, 1.3 billion euros short of an interim target set by the bailout plan, the figures showed. In a bid to make up the shortfall, the finance ministry has slashed investment by about a fifth, further hurting the economy. It also cut back on primary spending, before interest service costs, by 9 percent, partly by suspending payments to government suppliers and state workers. (Reporting by Harry Papachristou)\n",

Both companies are now racing to carve a new advantage by recasting many, if not most, cleared energy swaps as futures -- thereby making them exempt from new Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules due to come into effect on October 12. Some of those rules may now be delayed, Bloomberg reported. The switch to futures is in large part semantic: In most key respects, the newly renamed oil, natural gas or electricity futures contracts are almost identical to the swaps that companies like BP ( BP.L ) or Glencore ( GLEN.L ) have been routinely using to hedge for a decade. But for the energy industry, where clearing has been a mainstay ever since the Enron meltdown over a decade ago, the benefit of switching to futures is huge. Under the CFTC's new swaps rules, many could face much stricter regulatory requirements, including putting up more capital, if they trade more than $8 billion a year of swaps. Whichever exchange offers the smoothest transition and greatest regulatory security stands to win more volume. For both ICE and CME, the stakes are substantial. Over-the-counter energy clearing generated about $400 million or 30 percent of ICE's total revenue last year, and about $300 million, or 9 percent of the CME's. CME does not break out revenue from clearing other kinds of swaps. And even though energy clearing is a smaller piece of the CME's pie, analysts say there is greater pressure on the CME to get it right in the battle for market share, one that is fuelling the biggest energy upheaval in a decade. Although the regulatory uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook amid questions over what exactly will be counted as a swap, the CME \"might not be as well positioned as ICE\" for the coming era, says KBW analyst Niamh Alexander. For at least the past three and a half years -- as far back as CME data is available -- ICE has dominated the business, with volume doubling even as CME's activity has slipped. Last year ICE handled nearly four times the energy swaps contracts as CME; so far this year ICE's volume is running at five times that at CME. ENERGY SWAPS IN CROSSFIRE The change is part of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms meant to drive the over-the-counter derivatives market -- blamed in part for exacerbating the 2007-2008 financial crisis -- into the safety of clearinghouses, which guarantee the trades. In broad terms the shift means money for clearinghouses, with vast parts of the interest rate and credit swap trading currently done bilaterally over-the-counter. Clearing revenue could reach about $2.1 billion by 2014, says Alexander. There is less growth for energy swaps, which have been predominantly traded on a centrally cleared basis for years. Regulators, for their part, say they are merely trying to create a safer world. \"I could care less about any competitive issues between CME and ICE, but I want to ensure that our rules don't roil the markets,\" CFTC commissioner Bart Chilton told reporters this week in Chicago. In a swap, the trader on one side of the contract agrees to periodically pay a fixed price for, say, a barrel of oil, and the trader on the other side agrees to pay whatever price the market currently bears. Like an exchange-traded futures contract, which is a deal to buy or sell a set amount of a commodity at a future date, a swap lets traders lock in prices or bet on price swings. But swaps have historically been traded away from exchanges and were not as heavily policed -- until now. DIFFERING ROOTS ICE and CME grew out of very different parts of the energy market. ICE, founded in 2000 by big Wall Street banks, energy companies and electricity merchants, was a power and gas trading platform, while the New York Mercantile Exchange and Clearport, acquired by CME in 2008, had its deepest roots in oil. Ever since the late 2001 collapse of power-trading giant Enron drove most energy swaps users to seek the safety of clearing, both have grown. The 2008 financial crisis that forced companies to reassess the creditworthiness of the biggest traders gave another boost to clearing activity, years before new rules would make such centralized risk mandatory. But over the years, offerings by the CME and ICE have increasingly overlapped for both on-exchange futures -- including ICE's successful U.S. crude contract that mimics the Nymex benchmark -- and clearing for off-exchange swaps. CME and ICE compete most heavily in natural gas swaps, which make up about 57 percent of energy swaps cleared on CME's Clearport and 81 percent of OTC energy volume at ICE, according to data from the exchanges. Clearport, CME's energy clearing platform, also does a brisk business in oil swaps, which account for about 23 percent of the total, while ICE's second-biggest market is for power swaps, comprising 16 percent of ICE's swaps business, the data show. \"I'd say they're competing head to head on clearing now,\" says Chris Thorpe, executive director of energy derivatives at broker INTL FC Stone. \"The ICE technology and back-end systems seem to be better, and ICE has always had more competitive fees.\" ICE seems to be pulling further ahead this year. ICE cleared about 2 million OTC energy contracts a day in the first six months of the year, up 25 percent from its 2011 average and double 2009, according to its filings. CME handled 440,000 contracts a day this year through August, about the same as last year and down about 10 percent from 2009. VOILA -- FUTURES! ICE has set out a relatively straightforward response to the regulatory changes: Over this coming weekend, it will convert all of its cleared energy swaps to futures. CFTC approved the move this week, and allowed it to keep the same margin offsets, which save money for traders, it had when the contracts were swaps. It is a simple transition for ICE, since its most liquid cleared swaps are already traded on its electronic platform. \"ICE's transition from swaps to futures ensures that markets remain transparent and liquid because they already trade competitively and transparently,\" an ICE spokeswoman told Reuters. A CME spokesman declined to comment on liquidity, but said the exchange is \"ready to go,\" pending regulatory approval for some its own rules to ease the transition to futures. The CME has a more complex path, and will institute a series of rules that will make it easier for traders to replace swaps with futures but retain the benefits of off-exchange deals. Clearport contracts start life as swaps, and are converted to futures at clearing. Under a new rule filed late last month, CME will allow users to enter into the very same contracts away from the exchange -- a key feature of over-the-counter swaps -- but they will be designated as futures from the get-go. The problem for CME, however, is that it does not currently have a liquid trading platform for many of its Clearport contracts, making the transition to futures a bit more rocky. Until early next year, Clearport swaps will not count toward the $8 billion threshold that marks a large swap trader, a CFTC advisory showed this week, giving CME a few months to bring its trading platform up to speed.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits slid last week to the lowest level in more than four and a half years, according to government data that may provide a boost to President Barack Obama a month before voters go to the polls. \n",
      " The Labor Department report on Thursday was the latest data to suggest improvement in the jobs market, though the surprisingly large 30,000 drop in new claims may have reflected distortions due to seasonal adjustments that are likely to be smoothed out in coming weeks. \"The overall trend seems to be that the labor market is improving,\" said Brian Kim, a currency strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. A Labor Department analyst said seasonal factors had predicted a very large increase in claims last week, which he said would be typical for the first week of the quarter. Unadjusted claims did rise, but far less than expected, resulting in the sharp drop in the seasonally adjusted figure. He noted that one state reported a decline in claims last week when a rise had been expected. No states had been estimated for the report, he said. \"We will likely see some payback in the claims data reported next week. But through this potential volatility, it does look like the trend in the claims is improving somewhat,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan. California, given its large population and past \"massive swings\" in its claims data, was probably the state that caused the sharp drop in the seasonally adjusted figure, Silver said. A second Labor Department official said \"a processing issue\" resulted in the state, which he did not identify, reporting fewer claims than expected. \"We cannot dictate to a state how they process their claims ... This is one of the years they happened to be behind everyone else,\" he said, adding the Columbus Day holiday this week may have been one factor. \"This individual state, whenever there are increases in claim, usually range from 15,000 to almost 20,000,\" he added. The jobs data was tempered by a second report on Thursday that hinted at weaker U.S. and global demand. The trade deficit widened in August to $44.2 billion, as goods exports fell for the fifth consecutive month and imports declined fractionally. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, the lowest number of new claims since February 2008, about a year before Obama took office in the midst of the global financial crisis. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims edging up to 370,0000 last week. Zach Pandl, strategist at Columbia Management in Minneapolis, said \"you do have to be cautious about possible distortions. But with that caveat, the jobless claims numbers have been modestly encouraging over the last few weeks.\" The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, fell 11,500 to 364,000, the lowest in six months. U.S. stocks rose in response to the jobs data, while Treasury debt prices slipped and the dollar was lower against a basket of currencies. A government report on Friday showed employers added a modest 114,000 jobs to payrolls in September but the unemployment rate dropped sharply to 7.8 percent, also the lowest level since Obama took office. Former General Electric chief executive Jack Welch and others suggested last week the payrolls data was fixed to make Obama look better ahead of the election, a charge the Labor Department strongly denied. Obama's opponent, Republican Mitt Romney, has accused the president of mishandling the economy. Thursday's claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid fell to 3.27 million in the week ended September 29, the latest data available. It was the lowest since May. DECLINING TRADE A Reuters poll on Thursday showed economists were slightly less optimistic about U.S. growth, lowering their median growth forecasts to an annualized 1.6 percent for the first quarter of 2013, compared to 1.7 percent last month. The group of more than 70 respondents also trimmed their second-quarter forecasts to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent, suggesting the U.S. economy will continue its slow, steady plod despite a recession in Europe, a slowdown in China and more restrictive fiscal policy at home. The monthly trade deficit increased to $44.2 billion in August, from an upwardly revised estimate of $42.5 billion in July, the Commerce Department said. Analysts were expecting an August trade gap of about $44.0 billion. Overall U.S. exports dropped 1.0 percent as troubles in Europe continue to weigh on global growth, while imports fell 0.1 percent in a sign of faltering U.S. demand for consumer products, autos and capital goods. \"It looks like net exports will contribute negatively to GDP (gross domestic product) growth, subtracting as much as half a percentage point,\" said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York. A separate Labor Department report showed that overall U.S. import prices rose 1.1 percent for the second consecutive month in September, while U.S. export prices rose 0.8 percent.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - European banks will need at least another five years to bolster their capital base in line with new regulations, as they wait for loan books to slowly expire rather than sell them at a loss, a report said on Thursday. \n",
      " The resultant protracted shortage of credit for firms and individuals risks starving investment and spending and, in turn, hinder the economic recovery, according to a Deloitte survey of banks representing 11 trillion euros ($14.19 trillion) in assets. Banks need to reduce loan portfolios and trading positions to comply with regulators' demands to put up more of their own money for every dollar they lend. Almost three quarters of respondents to the Deloitte survey said that reducing balance sheet debt is likely to take more than five years - longer than previous banking crises. The IMF expects banks to reduce their balance sheets at a faster pace than suggested by Deloitte. October's Global Financial Stability Report said European banks are likely to offload $2.8 trillion in assets over two years, or over 7 percent of total assets. But Deloitte's report found the process - known as deleveraging - will be \"surprisingly modest\", involving less than 7.5 percent of total assets over five years. \"While the numbers involved are large in nominal terms, this is a relatively small compared with the expansion of credit in the boom years,\" said Margaret Doyle, head of Financial Services Research at Deloitte. Less than half of the 18 banks in the survey believe that selling off assets will play an important part in bringing down how much debt they hold. Finding a buyer was the biggest problem for nearly 60 percent of respondents. The fragile state of the European economy, meanwhile, has barricaded other avenues to higher capital levels, such as ploughing back earnings or asking investors for more money. Banks will be particularly reluctant to divest assets if they expect this to worsen their capital position, and more than 5 percent of respondents expect deleveraging to have a negative impact on their bank's Core Tier 1 ratio. While a rapid deleveraging process might require banks to take big losses on assets, the Deloitte report said a very slow deleveraging can raise questions about whether the assets remain overvalued following a credit boom. \"The uncertainty can slow economic recovery,\" the report said. \"This adjustment path may feel less painful in the short run, but at the price of a slower economic recovery.\" (Editing by  Douwe Miedema  and Hans-Juergen Peters)\n"

      " Europe's two biggest aerospace groups will go back to the drawing board to find new strategies after Germany stymied the creation of the world's biggest arms and aviation company. Italy's Finmeccanica, meanwhile, has been presented with various opportunities to take advantage of the merger's failure, Giampaolo Di Paola told reporters at the margins of a parliamentary hearing. The defense minister said that these have to be evaluated first by management and then by the government, adding: \"I would like to see these evaluations carried out very rapidly.\" Di Paola's comments, which came ahead of a meeting between Finmeccanica and the government to discuss possible alliance prospects, boosted shares in the state-owned conglomerate to their highest level in seven months. An industry source familiar with the situation said that Finmeccanica, Europe's third-biggest defense group, could take part in any cross-border talks for possible alliances in aeronautics, defense electronics and helicopters. The company, which posted a 2.3 billion euro ($2.97 billion)loss last year, would have greater bargaining power in sector consolidation talks if it manages to make progress in its continuing restructuring and asset disposal plan, the source added. Chairman Giuseppe Orsi and other Finmeccanica executives are expected to meet Prime Minister Mario Monti, Di Paola and Treasury Minister Vittorio Grilli on October 16 to talk about the prospect of alliances and development in the aeronautics and defense sectors. Finmeccanica, Italy's No. 2 industrial group behind car maker Fiat ( FIA.MI ), has put on the block its non-core energy and transportation assets and has promised to earn 1 billion euros from disposals by the end of the year to avoid its credit rating being cut to \"junk\". The industry source said that Finmeccanica's experience in building the Eurofighter could make it easier for the group to join any European or international partnership for the next generation of fighter aircraft, which could either be a drone or a more traditional fighter plane. Although its Anglo-Italian AgustaWestland helicopter business is profit-making, Finmeccanica needs to cut costs and restructure its aeronautics and defense electronics operations - sectors in which greater international cooperation is needed because of shrinking budgets. Analysts have said that Finmeccanica could expand cooperation or even consider a merger with French aerospace and defense electronics specialist Thales ( TCFP.PA ). Finmeccanica shares were up 1.1 percent at 1040 GMT (0640 EDT). (Additional reporting by Danilo Masoni; Editing by David Goodman)\n",

In January, the Merckle family confirmed it would seek damages from Porsche SE via conciliation proceedings, but the Stuttgart-based holding company declined to pay, according to the Porsche SE spokesman. Billionaire Adolf Merckle committed suicide in January 2009 while his business empire, including stakes in HeidelbergCement and drug wholesaler Phoenix Pharmahandel, crumbled following bets on VW, increasing debt and a drop in the value of HeidelbergCement stock. Plaintiffs have accused Porsche SE of camouflaging its takeover plans in 2008 and secretly piling up a holding in VW. When Porsche SE disclosed its stake in October 2008, VW common shares surged to 1,005 euros within days, briefly making VW the world's most valuable company as short-sellers such as Merckle raced to buy back stock they had borrowed to bet that VW shares would drop. The Braunschweig court dismissed two minor lawsuits against Porsche SE on September 19, sending a discouraging signal to claimants including Elliott Associates and other U.S. investment funds seeking damages.

      " ATHENS  (Reuters) - As Greece's privatization program resumes this month, nearly half a year behind schedule, at stake is not just the billions of euros it needs to raise, but the credibility of its commitment to reforms demanded by its creditors. \n",
      " Greek politicians are under intense pressure at home to resist foreign calls to sell state assets on the cheap and raise fast cash to pay down government debt. More challenging still will be efforts to use privatization as a tool to uproot corrupt business practices and restore foreign investors' confidence in Greece. The 15-month-old Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund aims to transform dozens of state businesses to increase value before leasing or selling them through a series of tenders. The first major sales - gambling company OPAP, state gas business DEPA and several prime real estate projects - could be completed as early as the first quarter of 2013, putting the fund back on track after wildly missing a 3 billion euro target this year. It now expects to generate just 300 million in 2012. Many hope privatization proceeds will help break the cycle of austerity and recession in Greece, where economic output has declined by almost a quarter since 2008 and unemployment is nearing 25 percent. Greece, the most indebted euro zone nation relative to GDP, has repeatedly missed targets set under its EU/IMF bailouts and risks being forced out of the single currency. If successfully executed, economists say the privatizations could add an annual 3.5 percent to GDP from 2013, enough to return Greece to growth, and create 150,000 long-term jobs. A leading fund official said the delays had been largely down to the need to get companies in a state to sell. \"As the interest for Greece is waning, you can't proceed with tenders where the assets are not 100 percent clean and attractive,\" the official said on condition of anonymity. \"We're having a deep dive in all the companies to single out all the major issues the companies have, to deliver them to the market,\" he said. WOOING FOREIGN INVESTMENT To create greater transparency and attract foreign investors, the fund was set up in July 2011 as an independent agency, with English as its official language. Its core task is raising 19 billion euros by 2015, but more important will be how Greece is perceived by international markets to be meeting criteria for its 173 billion euro bailout. \"It is absolutely critical we send a signal of change,\" the top official said. The privatization fund got off to a rocky start, with repeat general elections in May and June having stalled activity by more than five months. Its first head, Costas Mitropoulos, quit less than a year into the job, citing a lack of political will. \"The newly elected government has not given ... the necessary level of support,\" he wrote in a July resignation letter. \"On the contrary, in an indirect but systematic manner, the government has acted to undermine the authority and credibility of the fund.\" A high-level Greek official speaking on condition of anonymity said the current privatization target, down from an initial 50 billion euros, is still unrealistic because \"the credibility of Greece is at a low\". Investors are more interested in high-yield government bonds than sinking money into 30-year infrastructure projects with uncertain outcomes, the official said, citing conversations with major U.S. fund managers. WINDS OF CHANGE There are signs business practices are changing for the better in a country one official jokingly called \"the last Soviet-style economy in Europe\". An example came early this year, according to a person who was present, when Russian oil executive and former energy minister Igor Yusufov offered 250 million euros in cash to buy the Greek gas network in a meeting at the fund's Athens office. Yusufov confirmed attending a meeting at the privatization fund's office in April but denied proposing - in writing or verbally - to buy the network for 250 million euros in cash saying that this was not his intention. Yusufov's investment vehicle, Fund Energy, was dropped from the tender process for DEPA, the public gas corporation 14 companies are now bidding for, which is expected to fetch more than four times that amount. According to one source familiar with the discussions, the question of price was not raised by anyone because, under the terms of the tender, bidders would only put forward price proposals at the next stage of the process. Fund Energy complained at the time that its exclusion from the tender process was \"unlawful\", and says it is still interested in energy assets in Greece. \"We continue to be interested in energy assets in Greece and await the announcement by the government of new terms for the process of privatizing the country's energy assets,\" Yusufov said on Thursday. The privatization program requires a raft of bureaucratic reforms. At least 77 technical regulations, government decrees and ministerial guidelines must pass through Greece's notoriously slow legislature, including the creation of new market regulators. In September, the first small deal was reached when the fund said it would raise at least 81 million euros from the long-term lease of a shopping mall that once housed the broadcast center for the Athens 2004 Olympics. Next month, the sale of the highly profitable State Lotteries operator is expected, followed by the state's remaining 33 percent in football betting monopoly OPAP and a controlling stake in DEPA. Other businesses and properties slated for privatization are regional ports, airports and a multi-billion-euro, top seaside property at the site of the former Athens airport of Hellenikon. \"The finance minister and the prime minister are very keen to show the Europeans things are moving ahead, and a key priority is to show privatization is being accomplished,\" said Wolfango Piccoli of Eurasia, the political risk consultancy. \"It's a huge priority for the government. Not just revenue, but most important is to send a signal.\" (Additional reporting By Douglas Busvine; Editing by Will Waterman and  Janet McBride )\n"

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Its $45 billion merger plan shot down, BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) must now hunt growth elsewhere if the British arms maker is to find the cash needed to sustain big dividends and avert the possibility of a break-up. \n",
      " CEO Ian King is under pressure to spur the search for new business with a lucrative deal in Saudi Arabia now seen as crucial to bolster the balance sheet. The warning signs for the maker of Astute nuclear submarines and Challenger tanks are clear. Net debt at Europe's biggest arms maker is mounting, and there are ominous signs from the massive U.S. defense market that has powered recent revenues. The fact it considered a merger with Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ), a company in which it sold a stake in 2006 having balked at a full merger several years earlier, showed how wide-ranging BAE's search for a new strategy has become. \"The genie is out of the bottle now and they cannot put it back,\" one of the top 30 shareholders in BAE told Reuters. Armored vehicles used in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as warships and fighter jets for Europe have fuelled BAE's growth and profits. It has extended its reach with deals in Saudi Arabia and Australia. But Europe's arms purchases are drying up and U.S. and British troops in Afghanistan are heading home, meaning the outlook for BAE, formed in 1999 with the merger of Marconi Electric Systems and British Aerospace, is dimming. \"BAE shareholders, they need to ask management where they go from here because clearly in agreeing to do this merger there was an implicit admission that maybe their focus on defense was perhaps a failed strategy,\" Societe Generale analyst Zafar Khan told Reuters. Troops in Afghanistan will go home in 2014 when BAE's last Type 45 destroyer for the Royal Navy is also due to set sail. SAUDI LIFELINE Weak prospects for a \"big win\" to offset slowdowns in such programs are worries for both the company and investors, and analysts agree a upgrading a contract on Typhoon fighter jets for Saudi Arabia must now be at the top of BAE's to-do list. \"BAE really needs the cash from renegotiating Typhoon pricing with Saudi Arabia. Without it total gearing remains high to 2015 (and) we see a decreased possibility of share buybacks,\" said analyst Sash Tusa at Echelon Research and Advisory. The deal is worth more than 7 billion pounds and analysts estimate as much as 600 million pounds in cash this year. Without it, dividends that have grown by 10 percent a year could be in trouble in the near future. Even with it, growth hopes are modest. CEO King highlighted the program, and a campaign to sell warplanes to Oman, on a call with reporters on Wednesday. \"We have real key prospects in Saudi, in Oman and in other territories,\" King said, while Chairman Dick Olver said current dividend plans remain unchanged. But beyond 2012 some see trouble. Bank of America analysts on Thursday cut estimates on BAE's stock price and the dividends it is likely to deliver in 2013 and 2014. SWINGEING CUTS BAE's push into the United States has been the most successful of any European defense firm. Few analysts question setting up shop in a market four times the size of Britain, Germany and France combined. But that exposure now leaves BAE vulnerable, as the Pentagon lines up $487 billion in spending cuts over the next decade. Worse, there is a major risk of the figure doubling unless Washington swiftly gets its finances in order. \"BAE are left in a tricky position, closely linked to defense spending with U.S. budget cuts likely and the threat of (further cuts under U.S. budgetary) sequestration looming,\" said a second BAE shareholder. \"Consolidation would seem sensible in the face of such difficulties, but as we have seen, this is not going to be easy to achieve,\" he said of the EADS escapade. Wednesday's collapse of the mooted EADS-BAE merger was blamed on the German, French and UK governments failing to agree terms. BAE shareholders speaking to Reuters on Thursday were willing to give management time to recover from the affair, but analysts did not discount the possibility of shareholders looking for value through a break-up. Most said BAE getting taken over in its entirety was unlikely given its size and tough competition rules in the United States where its most likely suitors operate. But some saw a chance of a buyer looking at parts of the business. \"We see a greater likelihood in one of the U.S. groups making an offer for (U.S.-based unit) BAE Inc,\" said Societe Generale's Khan. \"We believe that BAE should explore all options to maximize value for shareholders, including the disposal of the U.S. business.\" Management's more mundane challenges also linger, including BAE's retirement funding shortfall and rising net debt pile. Net debt of 1.44 billion pounds in 2011 was six times the figure from the year before, while the funding gap jumped by more than 1 billion pounds. Better cash inflow could come this year, management promised in an interim statement on Thursday, but linked this to securing the Saudi deal. Modest growth in 2012 underlying earnings per share would also hinge on that deal getting done.

      " BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Union accused the United States on Thursday of ignoring a World Trade Organisation ruling to stop subsidies to planemaker Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and asked the Geneva-based body to investigate, prolonging the world's largest trade dispute. \n",
      " The United States said last month it had complied with an order to withdraw subsidies to Boeing after the WTO found in March that the U.S. aircraft manufacturer had received billions of dollars in unfair aid. But the European Commission, the EU's executive, said Washington has shown no proof it has complied. \"It is now clear for the European Union that the United States has not only failed to properly implement the decision of the WTO but it has even provided new subsidies to Boeing,\" the Commission said in a statement. The Commission said U.S. subsidies were costing European aerospace companies billions of euros in lost revenue and that recent U.S.-EU talks had failed to resolve the dispute. \"The U.S. claimed to have removed (the subsidies), but provided no detailed evidence to support its claims,\" it said. Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office, said the United States remained \"confident that the actions we announced on Sept 23rd brought us into full compliance with our WTO obligations.\" The EU's request for a panel to review the U.S. compliance effort seems to ignore U.S. programs \"that we made clear have been terminated,\" she said. The WTO has also ruled against European support to Airbus in a case brought by the United States. Washington accuses the EU of not complying with that ruling. Airbus is owned by EADS ( EAD.PA ), in which the French government has a stake and the German government has influence via a holding owned by Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ). \"Instead of bringing into compliance the massive illegal subsidies that Boeing has received in the past and continues to receive from U.S. federal and state governments ... Boeing has neither paid back nor eliminated the illegal subsidies,\" said a spokeswoman for Airbus. Washington is threatening up to $10 billion in sanctions in the dispute, while Brussels is threatening $12 billion. However, most observers expect both sides to eventually negotiate a settlement to end the dispute. (Reporting by  Robin Emmott ; Editing by  Kevin Liffey  and  Eric Walsh )\n"

      "-- Analysis: Fund firms cut back on new ETFs, closing more\n",

      " NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fund companies are growing more wary of introducing new exchange-traded funds, and more willing to kill those that have not caught on, as they grapple with a price war in an overcrowded $1.2 trillion market dominated by the three largest providers. \n",
      " BlackRock Inc.( BLK.N ), State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard Group offer ETFs in virtually every major asset class. Together, the Big Three have captured 77.6 percent of all new investor money that has come this year into the U.S. ETF market this year, up from 60.5 percent in 2011, according to Lipper. In recent weeks, Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ) slashed its ETF fees and BlackRock said it planned to. This all makes it more difficult for new entrants to successfully compete. That has cut the net increase in ETFs in the first nine months of this year to just 60, down almost 69 percent from 192 in the same period last year, according to IndexUniverse LLC. While there were 146 new ETFs launched, down 34 percent from 222 in the year-earlier period, there was also a huge spike in ETF closures to 86, almost triple the 30 for all of 2011. With more than 1,450 ETFs available in the United States, firms realize there are very few opportunities to find a niche that is not already covered, said Tim Strauts, ETF analyst at Morningstar Inc ( MORN.O ). Some firms are also exiting the business entirely. In just the past few months, Scottrade and Russell Investments announced the shut-down of their ETF businesses and Direxion Shares and Global X said they were closing a number of ETFs after they failed to garner assets. Those who are launching new ETFs are adding new methodologies to offer twists on already popular ideas, Strauts said. To compete with the largest ETF providers, firms must find better ways to structure exposure to various sectors, said Bruno del Ama, chief executive officer of Global X Funds, which has 31 ETFs with $1.5 billion in assets. \"It's not necessarily cheaper exposure, or new exposure, but smarter exposure,\" del Ama said. Most industry analysts expect the pace of new ETF creation will slow even further as firms increasingly realize how difficult it is to be successful in this market. Dave Nadig, director of research at IndexUniverse, estimates in the coming years, the standard number of new ETFs coming to market will be between 80 and 100 a year. There were 222 launches in 2011. \"The pace of growth ... and the pace of closures will slow as firms stop trying these niche products that fail and need to be closed 18 months later,\" Nadig said. SQUEEZING MARGINS, NEW TWISTS Any firm looking to launch a new ETF must first contend with the Big Three both on breadth and price. Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, early entrants into ETFs, have established themselves over the past decade or more. These firms together hold $943.17 billion in ETF assets, or 73 percent of the U.S. total, according to Lipper, a share of flows they have maintained despite increasing competition over the years. Vanguard, long the low-cost leader, has gained market share over the last several years, though it is now facing more price competition. Schwab, for instance, slashed some of its fees to pennies. The environment makes it tough for smaller players trying to get a better foothold in the business. Copycat ETFs often fail to attract investors away from established funds, said Paul Baiocchi, an ETF analyst at IndexUniverse. He added that niche strategies have trouble attracting investors and may also have liquidity issues. Fewer niche ETFs are being launched, although some still raise eyebrows. For example, on September 28, a newcomer to ETFs, LocalShares, filed to introduce the \"Nashville ETF,\" which would invest only in Nashville, Tennessee-based companies. Some ETFs of that nature - including one for Oklahoma and another for Texas launched in 2009 - were closed within a year after failing to attract investors. In some cases, firms are being more creative by taking popular asset classes, like junk bonds or commodities, and packaging them differently - often using customized indexes. For example Van Eck's Market Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond ETF ( ANGL.P ), which started trading in April, tracks an index of bonds that were issued as investment grade, but have since been downgraded. The $10.6 million ETF - tiny by comparison to more-liquid ETFs - is yielding 6 percent so far this year. Van Eck has practically made its business case around the idea of taking existing asset classes and creating new indices, said Ed Lopez, its director of marketing. \"There are a lot of ideas that would help improve products that are already out there,\" Lopez said. Existing ETFs track specific indexes, making it hard to change the way they invest. \"Traditional bond indexes put the most money into the most indebted company or country,\" Nadig said. \"You are starting to see indexes with weightings based on something other than the issuer.\" Similarly, firms are launching commodity ETFs that address problems that have haunted these products. Many commodity ETFs that track futures have suffered from \"contango,\" where future prices are higher than the current spot price, causing the ETFs to perform differently than their underlying commodities. But recently, more providers have introduced commodity ETFs tracking indices that do not roll into the front month's future contracts, but are instead more tactical. For instance, BNP Paribas Stream S&P Dynamic Roll Global Commodities Fund BNPC.P, which started trading in June, can participate in contracts further out on the futures curve, mitigating the potential for contango. The $17 million ETF has returned 11.84 percent for the past three months, compared to its benchmark, the Morningstar Long-Only Commodity TR Index, which has returned 7.95 percent for the same period. The danger of some of these products, however, is that they may not trade often and thus trade at a premium or a discount to their underlying securities. And some of these new ETFs may be too complicated, scaring away already-wary investors. \"Some of these products may be too sophisticated for their own good,\" Morningstar's Strauts said. \"It may be tough for them to get traction with investors.\" (Additional reporting by  Ryan Vlastelica ; Editing by Jennifer Merritt and  David Gregorio )\n",

      " BERLIN/LONDON  (Reuters) - Europe's two biggest aerospace firms will go back to the drawing board to find new strategies after Germany stymied the world's biggest arms and aviation company merger. \n",
      " Britain's BAE Systems, which earns nearly half its revenue selling arms to the Pentagon, could end up a takeover target after failing to seal its $45 billion deal with the Franco-German maker of Airbus civilian jets, EADS. Politically, the deal's failure may hurt British Prime Minister David Cameron, who failed to persuade Germany's Angela Merkel to allow the merger and now faces uncertainty over the future of his country's most important engineering firm. EADS shareholders mainly expressed relief at the collapse of the deal, fearing for their investment in a successful civilian planemaker as it ventured into a declining defence market. EADS shares ( EAD.PA ) rose 5.29 percent on Wednesday, while BAE shares ( BAES.L ) fell 1.38 percent. The merger's failure is however a setback for EADS boss Tom Enders, who had hoped the merger would dilute the political control that Berlin and Paris exert over his firm. Britain and France both backed the planned merger, but Germany never warmed to it, despite the companies saying they were prepared to pledge to keep jobs there, allow Berlin to hold a big stake and meet other conditions. \"We started asking ourselves, 'Does this deal really make sense?'\" one senior German official said. \"The market went down, investors were against it, the synergies were unclear, as was U.S. market access with the big state shareholdings.\" BAE, a private company which enjoys privileged access to Pentagon contracts, would have needed Germany and France to limit their control of the combined firm to avoid alienating Washington which does not want foreign states exerting influence over its defence contractors. \"We had clear red lines that we were not willing to go beyond, relative to engagement and involvement of governments,\" BAE's CEO Ian King said. \"If that was going to impinge on our ability to commercially run this new merged organization, and support and develop our existing business, then we wouldn't go to that point, and that is where we are today.\" NEGOTIATIONS Ultimately, German officials said, the parties were unable to resolve the shareholding issue to everyone's satisfaction. Paris wanted to retain the option of going up to 13.5 percent by buying a stake held by French firm Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) at a later date. German officials insisted they be able to follow suit. The British wanted a cap of 10 percent each, concerned that the Germans and French could approach a blocking minority if they went above that level. Still, the companies believed they could have bridged the differences if Germany was more willing to negotiate. \"France and the UK agreed that Germany have the same stakeholding as France in the merged group. Separately, vast guarantees were given regarding safeguarding national security interests, sites, jobs. The topic of headquarters was being discussed very emotionally, but not an issue big enough to let the deal fail,\" a source close to the transaction said. The merger would have created a group employing nearly a quarter of a million people that could better compete with U.S. rival Boeing ( BA.N ). Asked whether BAE management felt under pressure as a result of the stormy investor reaction followed by the collapse of the plans, King said: \"Certainly not. No more than usual\". Britain backed the deal and has largely supported BAE's case that French and German influence would have to be limited to make the deal work, especially given BAE's vast U.S. business. \"Our view is that for this company as a merged entity to have been successful, it would have needed to be able to operate as a commercial company free of undue control or influence by any single government and that's something that the company evidently has decided it is not able to achieve,\" British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said. The merger never won over either company's shareholders. Barry Norris, founding partner at Argonaut Capital Partners, an EADS shareholder, said: \"Today's decision to terminate the merger talks is a triumph for common sense and shareholder value. Having sunk almost 30 billion euros ($38.70 billion) into new Airbus plane projects, which are only now beginning to break even, it made no sense for EADS to now share this with BAE shareholders. \"Continuing merger negotiations would have resulted in a long battle with shareholders and sustained tension over weak corporate governance. That the problems in executing the deal proved too complex should be a source of celebration rather than regret,\" he said. But without the deal, BAE remains exposed to severe cuts in U.S. defence spending as troops finish their withdrawal from Afghanistan. Among its many U.S. contracts, the British firm is the largest supplier of armored vehicles for the U.S. military. Chairman Dick Olver said the firm would return to business as normal, despite what he acknowledged was a tough climate. \"We have an excellent Plan A, which is driving the company, admittedly in a difficult business environment, and the executives are doing an excellent job,\" he told reporters on a conference call alongside CEO King.

      " The fishermen and farmers, together with the Friends of the Earth campaign group, accuse the oil major of polluting land and waterways around their homes in the Niger Delta region of Africa's top energy producer. Shell has denied responsibility, saying the leaks were caused by sabotage. The villagers launched their claim in a civil court in The Hague, where Shell has its joint global headquarters. It was the first time a Dutch-registered company had been sued in a Dutch court for offences allegedly carried out by a foreign subsidiary. Friends of the Earth said the claim, if successful, could open up a new way for plaintiffs to take on multinationals - by suing their parent companies in their home countries. The villagers, who appeared in court, want unspecified damages saying Shell and other corporations were responsible for pollution from three oil spills between 2004 and 2007. \"My community is a ghost land as a result of the devastation. We had good vegetation. Today people have respiratory problems and are getting sick,\" said one of the plaintiffs Eric Dooh, from the Goi community, which lives between two pipelines. \"Shell is aware of the whole devastation. I want them to pay compensation, to clean up the pollution so we can grow our crops and fish again,\" the 44-year-old told Reuters before the hearing. Shell says the pollution was caused by thieves breaking into pipelines to steal the oil, and believes it has played its part in cleaning it up. \"The matter has been resolved as far as we are concerned and we do not properly understand why Friends of the Earth has submitted the case,\" Allard Castelein, Shell's vice president for environment, told Reuters before the hearing. The biggest pollution problem in the Niger Delta was caused by thieves who steal oil from Shell's installations, he said. Around 150,000 barrels of oil are stolen every day in the Delta. That is worth about $6 billion a year. Friends of the Earth said other companies could face similar claims in European Union cities if it won the case. \"It opens up a range of possibilities for people from poor countries to use the legal system to seek compensation from companies,\" said Geert Ritsema, international affairs coordinator at the environmental group during a break in the proceedings. WETLAND ECOSYSTEM The Nigerians' lawyer Channa Samkalden told the court Shell had failed to maintain pipelines, clean up leaks and prevent pollution. \"It was insufficient maintenance, not sabotage, that was responsible for the leaks ... Shell did not operate as a conscientious oil company,\" she said. With around 31 million inhabitants, the Niger Delta is one of the world's most important wetland and coastal marine ecosystems. It is an important source of food for the poor, rural population. Last year, the United Nations said in a report the government and multinational oil companies, particularly Shell, were responsible for 50 years of oil pollution that had devastated the Ogoniland region, part of the Niger Delta.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ) has reshuffled the senior ranks of its team advising financial institutions on mergers and financing in Europe, as it renews efforts to bring in more investment banking fees from that industry. \n",
      " Henrietta Baldock, who had already been in charge of the European financial institutions group (FIG) since 2009, will now become chair of the FIG investment banking division, an internal memo seen by Reuters showed. Michael Frieser and Marc Tempelman have been appointed co-heads of financial institutions corporate and investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). \"With this leadership team we are looking to significantly build our market share in this sector,\" Christian Meissner, the global head of corporate and investment banking, and Bob Elfring, one of Meissner's European deputies, said in the memo. Bank of America's investment bank has been hit by a series departures and undergone a series of reshuffles this year, with Meissner only moving into the top corporate and investment banking job in January. The division is in charge of overseeing advisory activity on merger and acquisition deals and stock and debt underwriting. Earlier this week, BofA ML named capital markets specialist Rupert Hume-Kendall as chairman of corporate and investment banking in EMEA to bolster its coverage of key clients. BofA ML's financial institutions franchise in particular was hit after star dealmaker Andrea Orcel left for UBS ( UBSN.VX ) in March. Orcel counts banks such as Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) among his biggest clients, and BofA ML had scored a lead role underwriting a bumper rights issue for Italy's UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) before his departure. Baldock, who has been at BofA ML for 12 years, has worked on some big bank deals alongside Orcel, including the ultimately ill-fated acquisition of ABN Amro by RBS ( RBS.L ), and is also known as an insurance specialist. In her new position as chair, Baldock will assume a more ambassadorial role rather than a hands-on management job, liaising with key clients and trying to win new business. The financial institutions industry has remained a big focus area for investment banks even as they cut back in other areas as the flow of deals slows. In the first nine months of the years, global investment banking fees in the financials sector were just over $15 billion, while income from deals in the energy and power industry for instance brought in $8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

      " Dimon said the company is still paying the price for doing the Federal Reserve \"a favor\" by buying Bear Stearns in early 2008. \"I'm going to say we've lost $5 billion to $10 billion on various things related to Bear Stearns now. And yes, I put it in the unfair category,\" Dimon said, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington. Dimon's candid comments come one week after the New York State Attorney General filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan, alleging that Bear Stearns deceived investors buying mortgage-backed securities in 2006 and 2007. During a wide-ranging hour-long discussion that went from the \"fiscal cliff\" to the impact of regulations, Dimon bristled when a member of the audience asked him if he now regretted participating with the government to rescue Bear Stearns in light of the lawsuit. \"We didn't participate with the Federal Reserve, OK?\" he said. \"Let's get this one exactly right. We were asked to do it. We did it at great risk to ourselves ... Would I have done Bear Stearns again knowing what I know today? It's real close.\" The federal government engineered the rescue during the Bush administration when regulators were desperate to find a buyer who could take on Bear Stearns' toxic assets and help calm markets. Dimon went on to recount how he warned a senior regulator at the time of the deal to \"please take into consideration when you want to come after us down the road for something that Bear Stearns did, that JPMorgan was asked to do this by the federal government.\" He added that JPMorgan, which will report its third-quarter earnings on Friday, will come out fine in the end. But if he is ever put in a similar position again, he said he \"wouldn't do it.\" \"I'm a big boy. I'll survive,\" he said. \"But I think the government should think twice before they punish business every single time things go wrong.\" \"FISCAL CLIFF WAR ROOM\" Beyond Bear Stearns, Dimon also criticized the government for so far failing to seriously negotiate an agreement to avoid a fiscal cliff of $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts due to hit at the end of the year. He said JPMorgan is \"forming a fiscal cliff war room\" and will be prepared. \"JP Morgan will survive a fiscal cliff - it is just terrible policy to allow it to get close,\" he said. He backed several proposals supported by Democrats to raise revenues, including a higher individual tax rate for the wealthy and a hike in the capital gains tax to 20 percent while keeping corporate taxes low. \"I don't mind paying 39.6 percent in taxes,\" he said. Dimon is one of a handful of CEOs who have been lobbying lawmakers to give businesses greater certainty around budget and taxes issues before the year's end. Republicans want to extend low rates that expire on December 31 for all income groups, while President Barack Obama and Democrats want to extend the lower rates only for households earning up to $250,000. These are the expiring tax rates first enacted by President George W. Bush. The current top rates are 33 percent and 35 percent. They would rise to 36 and 39.6 percent under the Democrats' proposal. While a decision on the individual tax rates must be made before the end of the year, the corporate tax issue is almost certainly going to wait until next year at the earliest. Obama and his Republican presidential rival Mitt Romney agree that the current 35 percent corporate tax rate should be reduced to be more competitive globally, but they disagree on the extent and how to fund such a rate cut. Despite backing some of Obama's tax plans, Dimon told the audience he is \"barely\" still a Democrat. 'INTENSELY STUPID' During Wednesday's event, Dimon was also faced with questions about the \"London whale\" credit derivative trades that have so far racked up at least $5.8 billion in losses for the bank. While Dimon has previously acknowledged his bank's failure to intervene sooner, he went even further on Wednesday in assigning himself personal responsibility for not detecting the problematic hedging strategy. \"I should have caught it ... I didn't.\" He said the trading loss was \"really intensely stupid\" and \"it's kind of embarrassing personally.\" Dimon also touched on financial reforms more generally, saying he was frustrated with contradictory and overlapping regulations being pushed out by policymakers. He said JPMorgan could see more than $1 billion in annual overhead costs from new international and domestic financial regulations, including the Basel III capital standards. (Reporting by Sarah N.

      " Ingolstadt, GERMANY  (Reuters) - The automotive industry faces a tougher year in 2012 than it has done this year, Audi ( NSUG.DE ) Chief Executive Rupert Stadler told Reuters in an interview for release on Sunday. \n",
      " \"But this should not be a reason to fall into pessimism,\" he said, adding that the automotive industry will continue to grow over the next 10 years thanks to the enormous appetite for mobility among people in developing economies. Stadler also denied speculation in the German media that he might be a successor for Audi parent Volkswagen's ( VOWG_p.DE ) CEO, Martin Winterkorn, when he steps down at the end of 2016. He said he expects China's automotive market to grow 8 to 9 percent, with its premium segment expanding 20 percent or even 30 percent, though he did not give a timeframe. Audi is the market leader in the luxury segment in China, well ahead of German rivals BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and Daimler AG's ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes. Stadler, who has set a goal of making Audi the world's top premium car maker by 2015, told Reuters carmakers have a better chance of growing in the premium segment because emerging markets like China will produce a crop of millionaires in dollar terms. Audi is aiming for the top position in the United States, which has the world's biggest premium segment at nearly 2 million cars, he said. The company currently runs behind both BMW and Mercedes in that market. He said a new production plant there would help, but it was still unclear where the facility would be based. He noted that wages in Mexico were cheaper than in the United States, where parent Volkswagen already has a factory. But he said if Audi were to join the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, \"the investments would certainly be somewhat less,\" although exporting cars out of the United States would have high customs fees. NO VW PLANS Asked if he would like to be the successor to VW's Winterkorn, Stadler replied: \"No,\" adding he wanted to remain at Audi. \"I have many things to do here,\" he said. Like Ferdinand Piech, the current supervisory board chairman of Volkswagen, Winterkorn was Audi Chief Executive before becoming head of the executive board of Europe's biggest carmaker. Stadler has been Audi CEO since 2007 and last year became a Volkswagen board member. Unlike Piech and Winterkorn, who both studied to become engineers, Stadler graduated with a business management degree. Volkswagen works council head Bernd Osterloh told a German newspaper the company could miss its internal outlook for vehicle sales in 2012, without saying how much growth the company expects. \"The reason would be weakness in southern European markets,\" he told Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview published on Saturday. \"But in exchange, we have good chances of selling more cars than before in Latin America, North America and Russia,\" he said.

      " NEW YORK/LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Retailers saw a steady flow of last-minute shoppers on Saturday, the day before Christmas, putting a moderate cap on a pre-holiday season that started with a bang and has since waned. \n",
      " Industry watchers are forecasting a stronger holiday shopping season than expected, fueled by deep discounts at the start of the season, unusually warm and dry weather, a late Hanukkah, and an extra shopping day. On the last shopping day before Christmas, the scene at several malls in different parts of the country was busy, but neither shoppers nor retailers seemed overwhelmed. \"The last-minute Charlies have come out,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group. \"Stores are busy, but not bustling.\" The fact that Christmas Eve falls on a Saturday is good for retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Best Buy and Gap Inc. So is the fact that the day after Christmas is a Monday, instead of a Sunday like last year, when many people stayed home and watched American football, said Ramesh Swamy, an analyst in Deloitte's retail practice. \"The calendar is working in our favor,\" Swamy said. So is the fact that there was no blizzard this year, like there was last year. Many stores around the country saw brisk traffic in the past week, and Friday was the busiest shopping day of the season, according to a survey of stores done by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc. Sales at surveyed stores were trending up at a mid-single-digit rate for the week, on average, Taubman said, though luxury goods stores were trending up at high-single to double-digit rates. Saturday caps a key week in the retail calendar that saw a handful of major U.S. store chains staying open around the clock to cater to consumers' late-night shopping craves, from Toys R Us Inc to Macy's Inc, a decision hailed by shoppers and industry watchers alike. The National Retail Federation raised its forecast for holiday retail sales to a 3.8 percent increase from an October forecast of a 2.8 percent increase. And ShopperTrak, which monitors traffic at shopping malls, now expects sales in November and December to rise 3.7 percent, up from its September forecast of 3 percent. NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT The Thanksgiving weekend, which marks the unofficial start to holiday shopping, saw sales soar 16.4 percent to $52.4 billion this year, the NRF said. The number of transactions at merchants jumped 17 percent on Black Friday alone, dwarfing the 5 percent gains seen in the prior two years, according to data from MasterCard Inc's network. The binge was spurred by deep discounts, but they have since moderated, thanks to tighter inventory management by retailers who often would rather sell fewer items at full price than more items at profit-sapping markdowns. \"It isn't how much you sell but how well you sell it,\" said NPD's Cohen. \"Retailers would rather sell out than sell off.\" As a result, inventory on key gift items, such as sweaters, was quite low in many stores on Saturday, Cohen said, and the discounts were not that extreme. One shopper, who only wanted to be identified as 67-year-old Bill V., was finishing up his holiday shopping at a Las Vegas-area Macy's store early Saturday morning. Armed with several bags filled with gifts for his wife, daughter and grandson, he said the deals were not much to write home about. \"They were OK. They could have been better,\" he said. Vickie Hoffman, a 39-year-old stay-at-home mom, bought some perfume and lotions at Victoria's Secret and an engraved snow globe for some last-minute gifts on Saturday. \"I didn't think so much of the sales this year,\" Hoffman said. \"I didn't think there were many great deals. I just didn't see them.\" Most of the steepest discounts on clothing on Saturday were for cold-weather coats, due to the mild weather this season. A Macy's in suburban Las Vegas was offering 50 percent to 60 percent off women's winter coats, 60 percent off sweaters, 50 percent off slippers and fuzzy socks and 40 percent to 70 percent off purses. Children's clothing chain Gymboree was selling all its merchandise, in stores and online, for $15.99 or less. Guess Inc had 50 percent off sweaters, outerwear and boots and teen clothing chain Aeropostale Inc had women's fleeces, originally $49.50, on sale for $18 and men's and women's jeans, originally $54.50, on sale for $25. All retailers offer discounts to draw shoppers as part of their holiday strategy. But unplanned markdowns, as a result of poor sales, is what hurts profit margins. On balance, margins are expected to be better this year than last, Cohen said, but January will be the key. That is when shoppers head to stores with returns or gift cards, often spending 16 percent more than the value of their credit, he said. Some retailers' tactics included offering people store credit that they can use starting next week, as a way to get them back in the stores once the full-priced, spring merchandise hits shelves, Swamy said. The weak economy has put a damper on consumer confidence, but shoppers' resilience has surprised the industry. \"There are still a lot of issues out there, including uncertainty in the economy,\" Swamy said. \"But for whatever reason it didn't dampen people's holiday spirit.

      " BEIJING  (Reuters) - Japan and China agreed to start formal talks early next year on a free trade pact that would also include South Korea, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Sunday after talks that showed the deepening bonds between Asia's two biggest economies. \n",
      " Japan also said it was looking to buy Chinese treasury debt, and the two governments agreed to enhance financial cooperation. \"On a free trade agreement among Japan, China and South Korea, we've made a substantial progress for an early start of negotiations,\" Noda told reporters after his meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao. China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, said on its website (www.pbc.gov.cn) that the two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral financial market cooperation and \"encourage the use of the renminbi and Japanese yen in international trade transactions between the two countries.\" The renminbi is another name for China's yuan currency. The trade talks announcement builds on an agreement between the three countries last month also to seek a trilateral investment treaty and finish studies on the proposed free trade agreement by the end of December so that they could start formal negotiations on the trade pact. \"China is willing to closely coordinate with Japan to promote our two countries' monetary and financial development, and to accelerate progress of the China-Japan-Republic of Korea free-trade zone and East Asian financial cooperation,\" Wen told Noda at the meeting, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry's official website (www.mfa.gov.cn). But the regional trade negotiations could also compete for attention with Washington's push for a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), after Japan said last month it wants to join in the talks over the U.S. proposal. CLOSER ECONOMIC TIES Despite sometimes rancorous political ties between the two neighbors, Japan's economic fortunes are increasingly tied to China's economic growth and consumer demand. China and Japan are also the world's first and second-biggest holders of foreign reserves. Wen told Noda that closer economic ties were in both countries' interests. \"The deep-seated consequences of the current international financial crisis continue to spread, and the complexity and severity of global and world developments have exceeded our expectations,\" Wen said. \"China and Japan both have the need and conditions to join hands more closely to respond to challenges and deepen mutually beneficial strategic relations.\" China has been Japan's biggest trading partner since 2009. In 2010, trade between the two nations grew by 22.3 percent compared to levels in 2009, reaching 26.5 trillion yen ($339.3 billion), according to the Japan External Trade Organization. In a statement issued after the two leaders' meeting, the Japanese government said it would seek to buy Chinese government bonds -- a tentative step toward diversification of Tokyo's large foreign exchange reserves that are believed to be mostly held in dollars. China central bank said the two governments agreed to support Japanese businesses issuing yuan bonds in Tokyo and other markets outside of China, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation would begin a pilot scheme for issuing yuan-denominated bonds in mainland China. The People's Bank of China also said it will support Japan in using the yuan for direct investment in China. But Japanese officials have stressed that Japan's trust in dollar assets remains unshaken, and the scale of the planned purchase of Chinese government bonds will be small. Wen and Noda also agreed to set up a framework to discuss maritime issues after diplomatic ties deteriorated sharply last year following Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain near disputed isles in the East China Sea. Bilateral meetings attended by vice ministers and senior officials from relevant ministries will be held periodically to exchange views, in an effort to prevent a similar row from happening. \"On maritime matters, we have successfully set up a channel to solve problems through multi-layered dialogue,\" Noda told reporters.

      " LONDON  (Reuters) - Europe faces another year of dismal economic performance in 2012 that will weigh on global growth, but emerging markets and the United States should at least keep the world economy moving in the right direction. \n",
      " There are several reasons why next year may be nothing to look forward to, according to Reuters polls from the last few months. Many of the world's biggest developed economies are heading into recession, global stock markets look set to recoup only a fraction of their heavy losses in 2011, oil prices will head lower, and asset managers are unsure where best to invest. And these could be the best-case scenarios. Most economists base their assumptions on the hope that the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis will not boil over into a new global economic crisis, having already dented growth in major exporters to Europe. Still, most of the major emerging market economies like Brazil and China should pick up speed later next year. All of them have suffered from slowing economies in recent months, caused mainly by tightening monetary policy in the face of high inflation. \"It's important to stress the world economy is still growing. But it's a tale of two worlds,\" said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank. \"The storyline for 2012 is that Europe drags the world down in the first half of the year, and China drags it up in the second half of the year.\" Enormous political risks cloud the outlook further, with elections and leadership changes in the most powerful countries and the prospect of continuing turmoil in the Middle East. Still, there are glimmers of hope. The United States' economy has performed better than most had hoped over the last quarter, and Reuters' polls of economists show it growing around 2.2 percent in 2012, compared with zero growth in the euro zone. \"The big unknown in Europe and the U.S. is that big companies, with balance sheets in good shape, have the ability to invest at home if they want. It's more likely that will take place in the U.S. rather than Europe,\" said Lyons. THE EURO ZONE QUESTION European Union leaders took a historic step towards greater fiscal integration earlier in December, but economists have been clear that this would not ease a debt crisis entering its third year and still hogging the headlines in 2012. Reuters polls show real concern that leaders are doing far too little to stimulate growth, with the likes of Spain and Italy destined for long and painful recessions. The euro zone as a whole, meanwhile, is probably in a moderate recession right now that will last midway into 2012. \"The euro area continues to be a source of economic and financial instability for the rest of the world,\" said Juan Perez-Campanero, economist at Santander, in a research note. \"We could be facing a more permanent and lasting decline in growth capacity in developed economies and, particularly, the euro area.\" Whether Spain and Italy will need to seek funding from the euro zone's bailout facility next year is open to question, with a very slim majority of economists polled this month - 27 out of 56 - saying not. And a November survey of 20 top economists and former policymakers in academia and respected research institutes showed 14 of them do not expect the euro zone to survive in its current form. Even in Japan, where economists have downgraded growth forecasts relentlessly, the economy is expected to pick up in the fiscal year from April and expand 1.8 percent. Japan should narrowly avoid a recession, but polls show little hope it will emerge from deflation any time soon. ASSESSING THE ASSETS The severe uncertainty surrounding 2012 is perhaps best reflected by Reuters' asset allocation poll of more than 50 leading investment houses in the United States, Europe and Japan. Investors raised their cash balance to the highest in a year in December as they prepared for a jittery 2012, although they also moved back into cheap equities, Reuters polls showed on Monday. The euro zone crisis was the key concern of asset managers polled, hence the increased preference for cash as well as moves into British and Asian shares rather than European ones. Similarly, the last quarterly stock markets poll suggested emerging markets will easily outperform European share indexes in 2012, which will struggle to bounce back to end-2010 levels, never mind end-2011. With Europe heading into a recession, oil prices look set to fall from here. Brent crude will average $105 a barrel next year, not far below this year's record high average near $111. \"We expect a mild recession across the OECD next year to put a damper on demand and consequently prices,\" David Wech from Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy said. \"Nevertheless, the risk to oil prices is definitely on the upside given a still troubled geopolitical environment.\" Economic growth is likely to slow among the Gulf's wealthy oil exporters next year, but governments will remain able to spend to counter the impact of any global slump, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. Respondents cited the euro zone debt crisis and signs of slowing growth in China as reasons for the darkened economic outlook in the Gulf. DELAYED CHINESE CHEERS Whatever the euro zone's future, the effects of the debt crisis have already been felt across the world. The European Union is China's biggest export market, and manufacturing data there show dwindling levels of foreign new orders. Indeed, the Chinese economy is now growing at its weakest pace since 2009. In an effort to support it the central bank cut reserve requirements at the end of last month for the first time in three years. Economists polled by Reuters after this move, however, said the People's Bank of China will refrain from more aggressive stimulative policies unless growth falls sharply to below 8 percent. Similarly, India has been suffering from a pronounced slowdown in growth and Reuters polls suggest its central bank will also slacken monetary policy by mid-2012 to counter this, despite stubbornly high inflation. It could be in for a difficult year. \"Looking ahead, the economy faces the lagged effects of monetary tightening,\" said Leif Eskesen, economist HSBC in Singapore. \"Moreover, administrative hurdles and domestic policy paralysis are holding back investments and hurting sentiment.\" Brazil's central bank on Thursday cut its 2011 growth estimate to 3.0 percent, versus its previous estimate of 3.5 percent, and said 2012 would see growth of 3.5 percent. Compared with previous years where growth averaged near double-digit rates, that would be a disappointment, although still a fair improvement on the anaemic rates of most developed peers. Overall, even the slightly depressed growth rates from these developing economic powers will power world growth next year. \"It is positive growth, but the picture does vary considerably - not just in terms of the first and second half of the year, but also depending on which part of the world you look at,\" concluded Lyons from Standard Chartered.

      " SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - While the threat of credit rating downgrades hangs over Europe, a few big emerging market economies are on the upswing. \n",
      " Indonesia provides arguably the starkest contrast. Fitch's upgrade of Indonesia's sovereign rating on December 15 restored it to investment grade status for the first time in 14 years. Back in 1997, when the Asian financial crisis exploded, the International Monetary Fund had to step in with a three-year loan worth $10.1 billion at the time. \"Indonesia's banking sector was not prepared to withstand the financial turmoil that swept Southeast Asia,\" the IMF said then. Fast-forward to 2011, and it is European banks that are the focus of concern as the euro zone struggles to come up with a politically palatable way to solve its own debt crisis. All three of the world's major ratings agencies have warned that European countries face downgrades if they cannot stem the crisis. Fitch said on December 16 that a comprehensive solution was \"technically and politically beyond reach.\" Sentiment toward Europe has turned so dark that the most positive thing Northern Trust economists could say about the outlook there was, \"Our base case is that the euro zone does not completely collapse within the next two years.\" Why the role reversal? Indonesia's 2012 growth is expected to reach 6.4 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists, down only slightly from 2011's estimated 6.5 percent. The euro zone is widely expected to be stuck in recession next year, while U.S. growth will probably trudge along at one-third of Indonesia's pace. The lesson that Asia learned from its financial crisis in the late 1990s was, \"make sure you've got good insurance.\" Asia now holds most of the world's foreign exchange reserves, with about $4.5 trillion concentrated in China and Japan combined. But there are also large stockpiles in India, Indonesia and South Korea. That cushion can provide protection from financial market turbulence. Indonesia, South Korea, India and others have tapped reserves this year to defend their currencies from extreme volatility. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ IMF on \"schizophrenic\" investors: imfdirect.imf.org/2011/12/21/2011-in-review-four-hard-truths/ For IFR's forecasts for the week ahead in U.S. economic data, click on:  here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \"SCHIZOPHRENIC\" INVESTORS The IMF itself seems to have learned a few lessons from its experience in Asia, especially on how deep budget cuts can hurt a country's economic growth and its citizens. Its November 1997 statement announcing Indonesia's bailout arrangement spelled out the IMF's policy prescription: tight fiscal and monetary policies and \"substantial\" fiscal measures to keep the budget in surplus. The IMF at the time expected Indonesia's growth, which had been around 8 percent before the crisis, to slow to 5 percent in the first year of the program and 3 percent in the second. In fact, Indonesia's economy contracted by 13.1 percent in 1998 and grew by only 0.8 percent in 1999. Former IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn acknowledged in February 2011 that the IMF's reform program had been \"harmful and painful\" for the Indonesian people. Many economists worry that Europe's austerity measures, much like those in Indonesia in the late 1990s, will end up doing even more damage to the economy, worsening the debt picture. IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard said investors were \"schizophrenic\" about austerity and growth. \"They react positively to news of fiscal consolidation, but then react negatively later, when consolidation leads to lower growth -- which it often does,\" Blanchard said. WHO IS NEXT? European countries are the obvious candidates for imminent downgrade. S&P's move could come any day. Moody's said on December 12 it will revisit its European ratings in the first quarter of 2012. While downgrades and the threat of more have received the most media attention this year, Fitch said its sovereign rating actions year-to-date were almost evenly split between upgrades and downgrades. Since August 5, when Standard & Poor's stripped the United States of its AAA-rating, countries including Indonesia, Brazil, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Paraguay, Peru, Kazakhstan and Israel have received upgrades from at least one of the world's big three ratings agencies. Next on the upgrade list may be the Philippines. Its leaders expressed some disappointment that Indonesia got the nod from Fitch first, although S&P revised its outlook to \"positive\" on December 16. But it is the negative actions that pose the global economic threat. The advanced economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have 2012 borrowing needs estimated at $10.5 trillion. A number this large means even a small increase in borrowing costs is meaningful. \"OECD debt managers are facing unprecedented funding challenges in meeting higher-than-anticipated, strong borrowing needs,\" the OECD said in a report on sovereign debt.

      " WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration cleared the way for states to legalize Internet poker and certain other online betting in a switch that may help them reap billions in tax revenue and spur web-based gambling. \n",
      " A Justice Department opinion dated September and made public on Friday reversed decades of previous policy that included civil and criminal charges against operators of some of the most popular online poker sites. Until now, the department held that online gambling in all forms was illegal under the Wire Act of 1961, which bars wagers via telecommunications that cross state lines or international borders. The new interpretation, by the department's Office of Legal Counsel, said the Wire Act applies only to bets on a \"sporting event or contest,\" not to a state's use of the Internet to sell lottery tickets to adults within its borders or abroad. \"The United States Department of Justice has given the online gaming community a big, big present,\" said I. Nelson Rose, a gaming law expert at Whittier Law School who consults for governments and the industry. The question at issue was whether proposals by Illinois and New York to use the Internet and out-of-state transaction processors to sell lottery tickets to in-state adults violated the Wire Act. But the department's conclusion would eliminate \"almost every federal anti-gambling law that could apply to gaming that is legal under state laws,\" Rose wrote on his blog at www.gamblingandthelaw.com. If a state legalized intra-state games such as poker, as Nevada and the District of Columbia have done, \"there is simply no federal law that could apply\" against their operators, he said. The department's opinion, written by Assistant Attorney General Virginia Seitz, said the law's legislative history showed that Congress's overriding goal had been to halt wire communications for sports gambling, notably off-track betting on horse races. Congress also had been concerned about rapid transmission of betting information on baseball, basketball, football and boxing among other sports-related events or contests, she summarized the legislative history as showing. \"The ordinary meaning of the phrase 'sporting event or contest' does not encompass lotteries,\" Seitz wrote. \"Accordingly, we conclude that the proposed lotteries are not within the prohibitions of the Wire Act.\" The department expressed no opinion about a provision in the law that lets prosecutors shut down phone lines where interstate or foreign gambling is taking place. Many of the 50 U.S. states may be interested in creating online lotteries to boost tax revenues and help offset the ripple effect of a federal deficit-reduction push. The global online gambling industry grew 12 percent last year to as much as $30 billion, according to a survey in March by Global Betting and Gaming Consultancy, based on the Isle of Man, where online gambling is legal. Federal prosecutors in April charged three of the biggest Internet poker companies with fraud and money-laundering along with violations of another federal law, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Act of 1986. The government outlined an alleged scheme by owners of the three largest online poker companies - Full Tilt Poker, Absolute Poker and PokerStars - to funnel gambling profits to online shell companies that would appear legitimate to banks processing payments.

      " In Nigeria last week, IMF Christine Lagarde said the IMF's 4 percent growth forecast for the world economy in 2012 could be revised downward, but gave no new figure. \"The world economy is in a dangerous situation,\" she told France's Journal du Dimanche in an interview published on Sunday. The debt crisis, which continues into 2012 after a European Union summit on December 9 only temporarily calmed markets, \"is a crisis of confidence in public debt and in the solidity of the financial system,\" she said. European leaders drafted a new treaty for deeper economic integration in the euro zone, but it is not certain that the accord will stem the debt crisis, which began in Greece in 2009, and now threatens France and even economic powerhouse Germany. \"The December 9 summit wasn't detailed enough on financial terms and too complicated on fundamental principles,\" said Lagarde. \"It would be useful for Europeans to speak with a single voice and announce a simple and detailed timetable,\" she said. \"Investors are waiting for it. Grand principles don't impress.\" Part of the problem, she said, has been national calls for protectionism, making it \"difficult to put in place international coalition strategies against it.\" Lagarde added: \"National parliaments grumble at using public money or the guarantee of their state to support other countries. Protectionism is in the debate, and everyone for themselves is winning ground.\" She did not specify which countries she was referring to. Emerging countries, which had been growth engines for the world economy before the crisis, have also been affected, said Lagarde, citing China, Brazil and Russia. \"These countries, which were the engines, will suffer from instability factors,\" she told the newspaper.

They've been discussing cuts that would total around $38 billion for the remainder of the fiscal year. Negotiations have been complicated by House Republicans insisting on some controversial policy changes, such as restrictions on funding for family planning and the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate air pollution. Once a deal is reached, Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate would then have to make sure enough of their rank-and-file members will support it. If so, a bill will be drawn up and sent to the two chambers for a vote. TIMING FOR CONGRESS TO APPROVE DEAL Once a deal is set, it would take several days to write a bill, post it publicly and then vote on it so that President Barack Obama can sign it into law. A DEAL AND STOPGAP FUNDING If there is a deal, Congress would move quickly to pass a stopgap spending bill to keep the government running past midnight Friday and until the deal is enacted into law. That action could come either late Friday or sometime on Saturday. House members have been notified they need to be available for votes in a rare Saturday session. House Republicans already have passed a spending bill keeping the government open beyond Friday. But with $12 billion in spending cuts over the life of the one-week plan, Obama says he'll veto it. Democrats are pushing for a stopgap bill with no policy restrictions or spending cuts. FAILURE AND STOPGAP FUNDING If a deal cannot be reached, the federal government would partially shut down on Saturday. Hundreds of thousands of government workers across the United States would be identified as either essential or nonessential. Nonessential workers would be furloughed while essential employees will continue working. Some government services would be unaffected by the shutdown, including the military, border patrol, air traffic controllers and federal criminal investigators. Fifteen years ago, when the last shutdown occurred, the government was partially closed for a record 21 days. Government employees were reimbursed for their lost wages. The government shutdown would continue until negotiators either strike a deal or Congress decides to pass a temporary spending bill.

      "{'text': ' Euro zone ministers said Portugal must make deeper budget cuts and privatize state firms in return for an 80 billion euro bailout the bloc wants to finalize by mid-May, just weeks before an election and state funding crunch. \\n\\n Portugal bowed to pressure from financial markets and its European partners this week and became the third euro zone country after Greece and Ireland to request financial help from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Finance ministers from the 17-nation single currency area met at a palace north of Budapest on Friday to discuss the details and timeline of a rescue, which has been complicated by political turmoil in the Iberian nation of 10.5 million. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates resigned abruptly last month after parliament rejected a new round of budget austerity his minority Socialist government had proposed to help the country meet its deficit reduction targets. He is continuing to serve in a caretaker capacity until new elections are held on June 5. The main opposition party has backed his request for aid, but negotiations on an economic adjustment program -- a precondition for assistance -- are likely to be tough as cross-party consensus will be needed. \"The preparations will start immediately to reach a cross-party agreement ensuring that an adjustment program can be adopted by mid-May and implemented swiftly after the formation of a new government,\" European finance ministers said in a statement. They said the program would be based on three pillars: an \"ambitious\" fiscal adjustment to restore financial sustainability; growth and competitiveness enhancing reforms including a far-reaching privatization program; and measures to maintain the liquidity and solvency of the financial sector. Inflexible labor laws, red tape in business administration and high wages and production costs compared to Eastern Europe and East Asia have undermined Portugal\\'s competitiveness. The country has posted meager growth, with an average annual expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) of less than 1 percent over the past decade, according to data from the IMF and the World Bank. RISKS FOR SPAIN Officials did their best to play down concerns that the contagion that has spread across the bloc\\'s southern periphery could now hit Portugal\\'s larger neighbor Spain, which has scrambled to reform its labor market, pension system and savings banks this year to avoid a similar fate. For now markets appear to be confident Spain can avoid becoming the fourth euro zone domino to fall. The spreads between Spanish bond yields and those of German benchmarks -- a key measure of investor confidence in Spain\\'s finances -- were hovering below 1.8 percent on Friday, their lowest levels in five months. Spain\\'s benchmark stock index has climbed 6 percent in the past three weeks. And in a sign of broader confidence in the euro zone, the single currency pushed up to a 15-month high against the dollar on Friday after the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points -- the first hike since July 2008. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who also attended the meeting in Hungary, declined to comment on the euro\\'s strength, which along with higher rates could undermine the economies of weak euro zone countries struggling under huge debt piles. Because of these risks, investors are continuing to scrutinize Spain, which has a host of weaknesses -- from high unemployment and weak growth to a troubled banking sector hit by the bursting of a property bubble. \"It has been clear for a long time that the current stage of the crisis is a severe combination of sovereign debt and banking sector fragilities and you cannot solve one without solving the other,\" said European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn at the end of the meeting. \"The next round of bank stress tests is decisive,\" he said, referring to tests being run on 90 European banks to gauge their ability to withstand financial shocks. The results will be published in June. \"STARTING POINT\" Ministers said the measures rejected by the Portuguese parliament last month would be a \"starting point\" for talks on a fiscal adjustment program. Rehn told reporters that European officials were confident Lisbon could manage the country\\'s funding needs this month and next, but that June, when some 4.9 billion euros in bond redemptions are due, would be \"more challenging.\" Officials said it would take 10 days to ensure financing once the bailout deal was in place, most likely by a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on May 16. The European Commission estimates Lisbon will require about 80 billion euros in aid, roughly the same amount as Ireland but less than the 110 billion euro package offered to Greece nearly one year ago. Two thirds of the total would come from European countries and the remaining third from the IMF. Ministers also discussed Greece, reminding Athens of the importance of sticking to its public deficit targets amid reports it could fall short for 2010. Speculation has grown in recent weeks that Athens may have to restructure a debt load that will to peak at over 150 percent of GDP, with senior government officials in the euro zone conceding in private that such a step may be inevitable. But the Greek government and leaders of other euro members have rejected that talk.

      "{'text': ' \"Let me be crystal clear,\" Barclays\\' star investment banker and new Chief Executive Bob Diamond told members of the British parliament in January. \"We are going to be here in the United Kingdom, and this is the place that we want to succeed.\" \\n\\n It may be a reflection of how bankers still struggle to be taken at their word in the wake of the global financial crisis, but Diamond\\'s statement convinced nobody. Rumors that Barclays and its bigger rival HSBC are ready to move their headquarters to Hong Kong or New York have flourished ever since. Speculation has intensified in the run-up to the April 11 publication of an interim report into the future of British financial services by the Independent Commission on Banking (ICB). The banks fear it will recommend costly reforms. A public admission by Diamond last week that he had \"an obligation on behalf of shareholders\" to look at alternative tax bases, and repeated warnings from senior city figures about the consequences of a high-profile defection, are seen as thinly veiled attempts to influence the commission\\'s thinking. But research by Reuters shows the commission should be in a strong position to counter such threats, since the impact of any big bank departures on the economy, government finances and the City of London\\'s pre-eminence as a financial center would be extremely limited. In a crucial year for global finance, as the regulatory landscape is substantially redrawn, this may embolden the committee. That in turn would help the Conservative-led UK government strike the balance it needs between sounding tough on an industry whose excesses anger the public, and appeasing some of the Conservatives\\' top donors. In any case, the banks\\' threats to quit the UK may prove overblown, says Andrea Leadsom, a Conservative member of parliament\\'s influential Treasury Select Committee: \"I think it\\'s unlikely -- I\\'d say no better than evens -- that any one bank will move offshore, and if they do move what that means for tax take will depend on the bank involved but is likely to be fairly limited.\" Leadsom, a former senior executive at Barclays and one of those who grilled American-born Diamond during January\\'s testimony, says senior bankers often tell her the government is on the verge of driving them away, but she is not impressed. \"I\\'m not an advocate of ever tighter regulation,\" she told Reuters. \"What we need is clever regulation. But I don\\'t think it\\'s as simple as saying \\'if you keep annoying us we\\'ll just leave\\'. I think that\\'s a nonsense argument.\" And even if some do leave, asks Leadsom, so what? \"One or two of them might change their corporate headquarters for tax purposes but if they do go we probably won\\'t even notice. There won\\'t be a great outflow of workers and Canary Wharf won\\'t turn into a ghost town.\" Some supporters of reform, including a few within the Bank of England, go further, suggesting that the banks\\' departure might even be desirable given HSBC\\'s $2.5 trillion balance sheet alone is bigger than the entire British economy. Even though HSBC has come through the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, that puts the bank firmly in the \"too big to fail\" bracket -- in a crisis, it would have to be bailed out, which may encourage risk-taking. TAX HAVEN BRITAIN? Banks have long been huge wealth generators for Britain. Most of that, though, comes from the dividends banks dole out, the jobs they create and the income tax their staff pay -- and not from corporation tax. That undercuts bank complaints about government treatment. When Oswald Gruebel, chief executive of Swiss bank UBS, launched a broadside against the British government last month, accusing it of neglecting the banks, he noted that his bank alone employed some 7,000 people in London. \"The government is so quiet about (the City),\" Gruebel told the Financial Times. \"Only behind closed doors do they pay lip service to wanting to keep the City. If it is abandoned by the government one day, God help you.\" But UBS\\' annual report for 2010 shows how tax advantages in London mean it and other banks that have made huge losses have a vested interest in staying in the UK where -- unlike the United States and Switzerland -- they can offset losses against tax indefinitely. Swiss tax losses can generally be carried forward for seven years, U.S. federal tax losses for 20 years, but in the UK or Jersey, there is no time limit. The English language version of UBS\\'s annual report shows in some detail how it hopes to be able to offset up to 51 billion Swiss francs ($56 billion) in accrued losses against tax globally in the coming years. While it does not specify how much of these the British taxpayer can expect to absorb, the tables do reveal that some 11 billion Swiss francs worth fall into the \"no-expiry\" bracket offered by the UK. A further 37 billion francs are due to expire in the next 11 to 20 years -- beyond typical Swiss limits but in line with U.S. allowances. The ability to offset historical losses is incredibly helpful to any company. Any corporation tax paid by UBS last year was more than offset by past losses, meaning that across the group it recorded a net income tax gain of 381 million Swiss francs. Unusually, it also posted a bigger net profit than its operating pretax profit. On this scale, the offset starts to make a new levy on banks by the UK government -- which has raised heckles in the city and which UBS has said will cost it 75-100 million Swiss Francs a year -- look like small change. Asked whether UBS had paid any corporation tax in the UK in 2010 or expected to do so in the coming years, a spokesman for the bank said it did not disclose information on tax paid in specific countries. At the same time, the UK government is making it more attractive to be based in London by cutting corporation tax to 26 percent from 28 percent and planning a further fall to 23 percent by 2014, which would be the lowest rate in the G7. It has also moved to allay fears -- a legacy of the previous government -- that companies\\' overseas earnings may lose tax-exempt status. \"The lower corporation tax rate in the UK and the move to exemption (on foreign income) should increase the desirability of the UK as a base,\" says Helen Miller, Senior Research Economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \"The U.S. has a higher statutory rate of corporation tax and it taxes global earnings, which sounds on the face of it less attractive, although there are many other reasons why companies might choose to base themselves in the United States.\" The United States manages to retain a competitive edge, for instance, because firms can avoid some tax on worldwide income by not sending it home. THE CORPORATION OR ITS EMPLOYEES? The sheer complexity of the global tax system is another disincentive to making a big move, a fact the ICB will consider in its recommendations. Another important factor: how little the banks currently contribute directly to the exchequer in relative terms, and how little that is likely to change as a result of any defections. HSBC, which unlike rivals publishes detailed breakdowns of its tax bill including actual figures, says it paid $750 million in corporation tax in the UK last year -- much more than many of its rivals but still a fraction of its $6 billion dividend payment. To put that in perspective, it equates to 0.08 percent of the British government\\'s total estimated receipts for the coming year or 13 percent of the total tax paid by the bank globally last year. HSBC\\'s best-paid 280 staff alone received about $472 million in cash and shares for 2010. More importantly though, HSBC will continue to pay corporation tax on its UK operations no matter where it is based. Hong Kong may not boast HSBC\\'s headquarters but it collected $962 million in tax on profits from the bank last year -- almost 30 percent more than HSBC paid to the UK in corporate tax. None of which is to argue that the banking system is not important to the British economy. The British Bankers\\' Association estimates its members contribute about 50 billion pounds a year to the UK economy, while Barclays boasted in its 2010 annual report that the banking sector employs nearly 500,000 people in Britain. In terms of taxes alone, Commercial Secretary to the Treasury and former banker James Sassoon told members of the House of Lords in February that large banking groups were expected to contribute around 20 billion pounds ($30 billion) in tax for the 2010-11 tax year. Crucially, though, that figure includes indirect contributions such as income tax paid by bank employees. Of his 20 billion pound tax-take figure, Sassoon says the proportion contributed by pay-as-you-earn income tax and other social contributions is 80 percent, with corporation tax making up the remaining 20 percent. Then there\\'s the argument that no one financial institution is, or should be, indispensable in a country where the Financial Services Authority regulates some 29,000 companies, which between them employ over a million people. \"When you see figures about how much the City contributes in tax, they lump the banks in with lots of other firms. Banks are only a small component of that, so when you talk about the banks leaving, there\\'s not going to be this enormous outflow of revenues,\" says Lydia Prieg, a researcher at the left-leaning New Economics Foundation think tank who previously worked on the trading floor at Goldman Sachs. Even if a bank leaves, it is unlikely to take all its staff with it. HSBC employs more people in the UK than it does in any other single market -- almost as many as in Hong Kong and the United States combined. A lot of those jobs are likely to stay no matter where the bank is based. That was certainly the experience of the world\\'s biggest advertising agency WPP when it shifted its tax base to a Georgian townhouse in a street just off Dublin\\'s St Stephen\\'s Green in 2008. Out of a global workforce of 138,000, WPP only ever moved a handful of people to Ireland before deciding last month -- prompted by the latest tax changes -- to move back to London. There\\'s also the issue of shareholders. Four of the top five biggest shareholders in HSBC, for instance, are venerable British asset managers. Indeed, about 40 percent of the $6 billion in dividends that the bank is due to pay for 2010 will go to UK pension funds and shareholders. Combined, the top eight shareholders alone will make more in the dividend payout than the UK taxman gets in corporation tax. Those dividends will keep rolling in wherever HSBC is based. It\\'s a similar story with other banks. Barclays declined to provide details of how much corporation tax it paid in Britain in 2010 but its annual report shows it had a worldwide tax charge of 1.5 billion pounds, which equates to less than 13 percent of its 12 billion pounds in staff costs, most of which are salaries and pension or social security contributions. In February, in response to questions from parliament\\'s Treasury Select Committee, the bank revealed that it paid 113 million pounds in corporation tax to the UK in 2009 -- 1 percent of its global pre-tax profit that year, and less than a quarter of the 504 million pounds in remuneration and deferred incentives handed out to Barclays\\' top bankers in 2010. And while much is made of the fact that Barclays\\' investment bank is now bigger than its UK retail operation, Britain still accounted for 40 percent of its total income in 2010, against 25 percent from the Americas. For all its readiness to import star bankers and investors, Barclays remains about as British as strawberries and cream at Wimbledon on a summer\\'s day. Almost half of its loans are made in Britain and about 60,000 of its 147,500 staff are in the UK. Last year 80 percent of the 2,000 new jobs created by the bank were in the UK -- hardly a sign of an impending exodus. The least British of the major London-based banks is Standard Chartered, which does most of its business in Asia and Africa. Just nine percent of its $16 billion 2010 operating income came from Britain, Europe and the Americas last year. But it too is a great illustration of how institutions tend to pay the lion\\'s share of corporation tax in the jurisdictions where the money is earned rather in their home base. The bank\\'s nominal UK tax bill for 2010 was $871 million, but some $697 million of that was clawed back in the form of double taxation relief which prevents the same income being taxed twice in two different jurisdictions. In the end it paid $174 million in UK corporation tax, or 13 percent of its foreign tax bill and 10 percent of its total global tax bill -- broadly in line with the proportion of income generated in the UK. That would be unlikely to change even if Standard Chartered shifted to a new base. A VERY BRITISH AFFAIR None of that makes a bank move from London impossible, of course. But it is worth bearing in mind when confronted with clamorous headlines about how the government might force the banks to quit Britain. \"There\\'s been a lot in the press about big companies moving offshore but there haven\\'t been that many. There hasn\\'t been a mass exodus,\" says Miller at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, told parliament last month that research by tax officials indicated 22 companies had left Britain for tax reasons over the last four years. One of the reasons for that may be the lure of London itself. The latest edition of the Z/Yen Global Financial Centers Index published last month -- which London has topped ever since the survey\\'s inception in 2007 -- showed the British capital remained top choice among financial services professionals, although New York and Hong Kong were not far behind. London is an \"extraordinarily attractive\" place for bankers to live, says MP Leadsom, even if high-earners have been hit with more income tax. English-speaking, and located in a time zone between the booming markets of Asia and the world\\'s biggest economy across the Atlantic, London also boasts good schools, luxury houses, and world-class restaurants. \"It\\'s effectively the capital of the developed world,\" she says. \"We speak the international language of business here.\" In his appearance before parliamentarians earlier this year, Barclays\\' Diamond tried to capture the reasons why, for the moment at least, British is best. \"Over time there has been no city in the world that has benefited more or been more supportive of foreign trade and flows of business in and out of the city than London. So London has become a place that is recognized as very good for business and very good for talent,\" he told MPs. \"People have enjoyed living here, but it has been much more about companies feeling that this is good for business, it\\'s good for raising capital and it\\'s good for attracting talent.\" PR POWERHOUSES So why all the complaints about increased regulation in London? The truth is that banks everywhere are lobbying hard to limit new regulation. Threats to move are just one weapon in their armory, even if any change of corporate headquarters is unlikely while such uncertainty reins. Regular readers of German business papers will know that Deutsche Bank has often touted a move to London. Investment banks in the United States complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage to their rivals in Europe. Some argue that the Volcker Rule, which forces U.S. banks to exit profitable trading ventures where they used the firms\\' own money, could have an even more dramatic effect on their businesses than Europe\\'s crackdown on pay. JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last month that new, higher capital requirements designed to protect banks from collapse would \"greatly diminish growth\" and risked \"putting the nail in our coffin for big American banks\". Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently wrote in the Financial Times that Wall Street reform under the Dodd-Frank Act \"may create the largest regulatory-induced market distortion since America\\'s ill-fated imposition of wage and price controls in 1971\". Standard Chartered Chief Executive Peter Sands wrote in his review of the bank\\'s 2010 performance that the biggest problem was the lack of predictability. \"Rather than seeing increasing global co-ordination and consistency of regulation, we are seeing increased fragmentation and unilateral action.\" Barclays\\' 2010 accounts flag \"greater regulatory related costs\" as a principal reason for rising administration expenses, but also show that the bank would need to carefully weigh up regulatory risks elsewhere before shifting bases. The bank paid $298 million last year to settle charges that it violated U.S. trade sanctions -- double the 96 million pound charge it took as part of its bill covering the cost of a 50 percent payroll tax slapped on bonuses by the UK government. The PR skills of the banks as they lobby to limit the damage from perceived over-regulation were not lost on the Bank of England\\'s Executive Director for Financial Stability Andy Haldane when he argued in late 2009 that there was \"not so much as a scintilla of evidence of bigger being better in banking. \"It\\'s true that the lobbying effort of the financial sector should not be underestimated,\" he told the BBC. \"Equally, the way to beat that back is by appealing to logic and to evidence.\" PRICE WORTH PAYING? And yet. Jon Terry, head of reward at PricewaterhouseCoopers, reflects the fears of many in London\\'s financial services community when he warns of the reputational damage to the City caused by any high-profile departure and of the long-term, indirect consequences of tax and regulation policy changes. \"The biggest issue for me is what it means for the future and stability,\" Terry said. \"We\\'re already seeing a number of large banking organisations, particularly overseas banks operating very large businesses in the UK, saying \\'we are not going to expand that part of the business in the UK -- it\\'s going to go somewhere else\\'.\" Chris Wheeler, banking analyst at Mediobanca, said the immediate impact of a withdrawal from London may be small, if embarrassing, but the risk was that it would grow. \"The odds are probably on them staying, but we\\'ll see what comes out ... in case there\\'s something there that\\'s so toxic it makes life difficult,\" he said. \"If Barclays or HSBC pulled the plug there would be major prestige issues, lost taxations and all the add-on services.\" There is no sign that major investors are yet actively agitating for moves abroad but they are watching closely. \"All investors want is that everyone has the same rules. But if the UK is out of line, then that\\'s a problem,\" said one of HSBC\\'s top 10 shareholders, who spoke on condition of anonymity and pointed to HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered as the most likely to shift. \"Most of the banks want to stay -- none of them want to leave but if it was clear their valuation was going to be significantly different in another jurisdiction, they would go. It wouldn\\'t take too much.\" Those outside the City argue that regulators should not be shy about setting the bar high if it means taxpayers feel their banking system is safer. Hundreds of millions of pounds in lost tax revenue may turn out to be small price to pay for offloading trillions of pounds in bank liabilities. \"As long as we continue to have institutions that are so big that they can bring down the rest of the economy, there will always be an implicit taxpayer subsidy and these banks will be able to borrow at interest rates much lower than they would in a competitive market,\" says New Economics Foundation\\'s Prieg. The British public has shown its capacity (if not its enthusiasm) for bailing out major financial institutions. But any new host to HSBC would have to be ready to act as lender of last resort to an institution with a balance sheet bigger than all but the world\\'s five largest economies. The Bank of England\\'s Haldane has argued that Britain might do well to offload some of the risk inherent in such banking behemoths. \"Some of the downsides of carrying around a big financial system are now evident to all,\" he told the BBC. \"If some of that were to migrate overseas that would be unfortunate but given the costs of carrying that financial system around, it may be a price worth paying.\" (Reporting and writing by Paul Hoskins; Additional reporting by  Steve Slater ,  Myles Neligan ,  Sinead Cruise  and  Kirstin Ridley  in London; Editing by  Simon Robinson  and  Sara Ledwith )', 'date': ' Fri Apr 8, 2011 8:41am EDT\\n', 'title': ' Special Report: Why London can live without its big banks\\n', 'author': ' By  Paul Hoskins\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/us-britain-banks-idUSTRE73725G20110408\\n\\n \\n\\n LONDON  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' The Justice Department approved Google Inc\\'s purchase of ITA Software with stiff conditions on Friday, and left the door open to a larger probe into whether Google manipulates its search results to hurt rivals. \\n\\n The Justice Department blessed the $700 million deal with the ticketing software company. Google promised to license the software for five years, to continue to upgrade it, and to establish firewalls to protect ITA clients\\' intellectual property. The ITA buy is part of an acquisition and hiring spree as Google aims to ensure its online services stay on top as Internet surfers go mobile and turn to services like the wildly popular Facebook. Now, U.S. antitrust regulators will turn to the question of whether to open a formal antitrust probe into allegations that Google, the world\\'s No. 1 Internet search engine, manipulates search results, a source told Reuters on Friday. The Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department are both contemplating an investigation but there has been no decision made on which agency may take it up. There has been a series of complaints made to the agencies -- many from Google rivals that specialize in searches such as price comparison websites -- that Google has made them difficult to find. A key lawmaker has been critical of Google, and remained so on Friday. \"We continue to scrutinize broader questions about the fairness of Google\\'s search engine, and whether it preferences its own products and services to the detriment of competitors,\" said Sen. Herb Kohl, chairman of the Judiciary Committee\\'s antitrust subcommittee. The European Commission took up an antitrust probe after complaints from three small companies, one of them owned by Microsoft. Microsoft charged that Google hurt competition by \"walling off\" content on its YouTube site, so other search engines cannot display accurate results. It also said that Google made it hard for Microsoft\\'s mobile phone software to show videos from YouTube, among other charges. The Justice Department was also aware that Google had an incentive to tweak search results to favor its businesses and was keeping an eye on the issue, said a Justice Department official who requested anonymity. \"There were a variety of complaints about bias in search,\" the official said. \"So, while we\\'re aware of those complaints we did not think they were relevant to this (ITA) transaction.\" Analysts said they believed that Google\\'s power in search meant the company had to step carefully, and that a broader probe was a big worry. \"A lot of these new markets that they enter rely heavily on search to drive traffic,\" said Yun Kim, an analyst with Gleacher & Co. \"That\\'s what the government is worried about.\" CONDITIONS PLACED ON GOOGLE BUY OF ITA Google said in July that it would buy ITA Software for $700 million in cash. The announcement sparked concerns that travel websites such as Kayak and TripAdvisor could be deprived of ITA\\'s software. ITA\\'s QPX is used by leading airlines and travel distributors like Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Microsoft\\'s Bing and Hotwire, among others. Disputes between Google and the online travel websites -- for example over fees -- are to be submitted to arbitration, the Justice Department said. Google said it was \"excited\" to get the deal approved, and would soon bring out a new travel search tool. \"We\\'re moving to close this acquisition as soon as possible, and then we\\'ll start the important work of bringing our teams and products together,\" wrote Jeff Huber, a Google senior vice president, in a blog post. Google shares dipped 0.3 percent to close at $578.16 on Friday.

Claims for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation could go forward, New York State Supreme Court Judge Melvin Schweitzer ruled on Friday. Claims for breach of contract were dismissed in part. The ruling applies to an amended complaint filed in December 2010 after parts of the original complaint were dismissed. According to the lawsuit, Access had hired JPMorgan's investment management unit to manage the investment account, called CMMF, with conservative objectives. Instead, the bank and Ufferfilge invested in risky and illiquid mortgage-related securities, at the same time that JPMorgan was shedding the same kind of assets in its own portfolios, according to court filings. The lawsuit also claimed that JPMorgan should have looked behind the credit ratings assigned to the securities by rating agencies, and independently assessed the securities' actual risk. But the judge dismissed that claim, saying the bank had no obligation to do so. However, the judge ruled that claims of negligence could go forward because JPMorgan increased CMMF's exposure to residential real estate while the sector was imploding -- and as it was reducing other clients' exposure to the sector.

The benchmark index was relatively flat for the week, down 0.3 percent, as the prospect of a government shutdown kept the rally at bay. Investors braced for a possible government shutdown as the White House and Congress scrambled on Friday to break a budget impasse ahead of a midnight deadline. But analysts said that while a U.S. government shutdown, which would idle hundreds of thousands of federal workers, would be short-term negative, the market had managed to rally even ahead of the looming deadline. \"There is an intellectual concern of what it means to shut down the government and there is the uncertainty of how long does the government get shut down and how much of a (hit) do we take on GDP growth,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated Investors, in New York. Many traders circled short-term puts on the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ( SPY.P ) as the prospect of a shutdown loomed. Shares of the exchange-traded fund, also called the Spyders, fell 0.3 percent to $132.86 in afternoon trading on Friday. The fund\\'s Weekly $133 puts traded more than 96,000 contracts, surpassing their open interest. Frederic Ruffy, a strategist at WhatsTrading.com, said the positions likely reflected hedges against weakness due to fears of a shutdown. Investors will also eye a batch of economic data next week, providing more insight into the economic recovery, including the consumer and producer prices indexes, the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index and the Federal Reserve\\'s Beige Book of economic activity. \"The inflation numbers will certainly be important -- producer price index and consumer price index -- the expectation is inflation will be higher than the Federal Reserve will feel comfortable with,\" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York. \"The focus next week will clearly be on the earnings numbers and the economic numbers and that is where the focus of the market should be.\" (Additional reporting by  Doris Frankel ; Editing by Leslie Adler)', 'date': ' Fri Apr 8, 2011 5:36pm EDT\\n', 'title': ' Will corporate earnings justify gains?\\n', 'author': ' By  Chuck Mikolajczak\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/us-usa-stocks-weekahead-idUSTRE7377KE20110408\\n\\n \\n\\n NEW YORK  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Taiwan smartphone maker HTC Corp said first-quarter profit almost tripled, beating forecasts, driven by strong demand for its handsets, particularly those running on the Android operating system \\n\\n The company, which has just overtaken erstwhile industry giant Nokia Oyj in terms of market capitalization, said on Friday that unaudited first-quarter net profit was T$14.83 billion ($511 million). Analysts had forecast a profit of T$12.99 billion. \"That its first quarter would be above expectations was well foreseen, Q1 seasonality was better than expected,\" said Bonnie Chang, an analyst at Yuanta Securities in Hong Kong. \"For the second quarter everyone is expecting revenue sequential growth in the high teens to 20 percent, shipments will be strong and average selling prices are holding up pretty well.\" Growing demand for phones running on Google\\'s Android platform will help the smartphone market grow in 2011, boosting companies such as HTC and Samsung Electronics who are betting on the platform. The smartphone market is likely to grow 58 percent this year and 35 percent the next, according to research firm Gartner. Android\\'s popularity has helped Asian manufacturers to rise fast in smartphone rankings. HTC\\'s market capitalization topped that of Nokia earlier in the week after a 29 percent surge in its share price so far this year. The shares touched a high of T$1,220 on April 7 this year, more than triple the T$360.5 on April 6, 2010. That surge has helped turn its chairwoman, Cher Wang, into Taiwan\\'s richest person. On Friday, the shares closed down 3.3 percent at T$1,160 versus the benchmark index\\'s 0.08 percent fall. Yuanta\\'s Chang said she expected to raise her price target for the shares to around T$1,300 to T$1,400, where she expected most other broker targets to be. HTC said consolidated sales for March reached T$37 billion, more than double the same month a year earlier. First-quarter revenues reached T$104.2 billion. The company did not elaborate in its statement. It has said at the beginning of the year that it expected revenue and shipments would be more than double in the first quarter this year, helped by a new generation of products.

      "{'text': ' The White House and Congress have until midnight on Friday to agree to a budget bill or there will be a partial shutdown of the U.S. government. The dispute is over funding for the remainder of the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. \\n\\n Republicans and Democrats say they want to avoid a shutdown, which could idle hundreds of thousands of federal workers, close national parks and Washington\\'s Smithsonian Institution museums. If there is no deal, many official websites would darken and furloughed government workers would be required to power down their BlackBerries at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on Saturday. The federal work force numbers about 4.4 million, including members of the U.S. military. Here are some facts about what could happen. WHO WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED? The military, law enforcement, FBI, prison guards, Customs and Border Protection, U.S. marshals, the U.S. Postal Service and any services deemed essential for the safety of lives and the protection of property. That would include air traffic controllers and federal disaster operations, as well as national weather and earthquake-monitoring operations. The distribution of food stamps and other child nutrition benefits, as well as NASA satellite missions. Also, any federal service with an alternative source of funding to annual congressional appropriations, like fees or operations financed through multiyear appropriations. HOW MANY FEDERAL WORKERS WOULD BE IDLED? Based on the last federal government shutdown, from December 16, 1995, until January 6, 1996, about 800,000 federal workers would be furloughed, including a \"significant number\" of civilian contractors working for the Defense Department, the White House said. The White House Office of Management and Budget said it was up to Congress to decide on back pay for furloughed workers, but the Obama administration would support reimbursement. After the 1995 and 1996 shutdowns, Congress approved back pay for furloughed employees. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE MILITARY? Operations in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq and Japan would not be affected. Military personnel would not receive paychecks -- although they would continue to earn salaries -- because the government would have no money to pay out during a shutdown. SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE Social Security and Medicare benefits for the elderly would continue to be paid. But help lines would not be staffed. TAXES The shutdown would occur during tax preparation and filing season -- federal income taxes are due by April 18. That would delay tax refunds to Americans who filed a paper -- rather than electronic -- tax return, or about 30 percent of the total number of returns. Electronic tax collection and refunds would continue. IRS tax audits would be suspended. PARKS AND MUSEUMS National parks, national forests and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington would close. But tourists in Washington, D.C., will at least be able to enjoy the city\\'s annual Cherry Blossom Parade -- organizers said city police would organize an alternate parade route that would avoid federal land. FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION The Federal Housing Administration would not be able to endorse any single-family mortgage loans or have staff available to process and approve new multifamily loans. The White House says that as FHA single-family lending represents more than 20 percent of the overall loan volume of home purchases and refinancings, this would be a hard hit on the housing market. OTHER SERVICES AFFECTED? During the last shutdown, an estimated 200,000 applications for U.S. passports went unprocessed and work on more than 3,500 bankruptcy cases were suspended. * New patients would not be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, although clinical trials already in progress would continue. * The Small Business Administration\\'s approval of applications of business loan guarantees and direct loans to small businesses would stop. * Daily life in the U.S. capital would also be affected. While schools would stay open and police and other safety services would continue, trash collection would be suspended for a week and street sweeping would cease. Public libraries and the Department of Motor Vehicles would close.

      "{'text': ' U.S. securities regulators are conducting a broad review of share issuance rules for private companies, including the 500-shareholder threshold meant to mark the transition to public ownership. \\n\\n The Securities and Exchange Commission review could make it easier for private companies to raise capital while delaying an initial public offering and the accompanying increase in financial disclosures. \"We are approaching it with an open mind,\" SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said of the policy review on Friday to a group of business journalists. \"I really can\\'t predict what, if any, change will come out of that.\" The issue has jumped into the spotlight recently as Wall Street banks and electronic markets offer investors a chance to buy and actively trade stakes in hot Internet companies such as Facebook and Twitter before they go public. An April 6 letter from the SEC to House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa sets out the issues involved in the review but is careful not to come to any conclusions. The use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, that aggregate investors and help avoid the 500 threshold, is among the issues being examined, as is the increasingly active trading of private shares on electronic platforms. SEC rules on what constitutes a \"general solicitation\" for investors, banned for private placements, is also under scrutiny. Goldman Sachs had planned to offer both U.S. and foreign investors a chance to own shares in Facebook through an SPV. Later in January it opted to limit the offering to foreign investors, citing \"intense media coverage\" of the deal. The effects of any SEC rule changes could be mixed. Raising the 500 investor threshold, for example, could be offset by tighter rules on SPVs. The rules also affect public companies that seek to \"go dark\" by returning to private ownership status. \"Many of the rules we have in place governing the offering process are decades old,\" Schapiro said on Friday. \"It makes sense for us ... to take a look at whether our rules have kept pace with changing market dynamics.\" Schapiro\\'s letter to Issa showed an SEC wrestling with the needs of private companies to raise capital against the investing public\\'s right to get the information they need to make informed decisions. \"I think all Mary Schapiro is really saying is that she wants a more realistic counting system that is less susceptible to manipulation,\" said J. Robert Brown, a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. (Reporting by Sarah N. Lynch and Clare Baldwin; Additional reporting by  Chris Baltimore  in Dallas; editing by Gerald E.

      "{'text': ' Here\\'s some advice for anyone hoping not to get caught in an insider trading web: Shut up. \\n\\n After the October 2009 arrest of Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, who was wiretapped by the FBI, the world woke to a new era of prosecutorial tactics in insider trading probes. For those considering crossing the line, the changes may make insider trading seem a vocation not worth the risk. Emails and other forms of electronic communication can be traced. Destroying old-fashioned snail mail or hard drives will not work if the government gets a tip it is being done. And don\\'t talk to people. There is no certainty that what is said will remain private. Indeed, recent phone recordings make some accused wrongdoers come across as Keystone Kriminals. \"Insider trading today is a lot more difficult to get away with than it was 20 years ago,\" said Andrew Stoltmann, a principal at Stoltmann Law Offices PC in Chicago who has handled civil insider trading cases. \"Prosecutors really are cracking down. And there are electronic trails left behind.\" GARBAGE CANS AND GARBAGE TRUCKS A recent proliferation of cases against fund managers, traders and lawyers shows a new aggression, especially in the use of wiretaps and recorded phone calls to build cases. The latest illustration: this week\\'s arrests of lawyer Matthew Kluger and trader Garrett Bauer. Prosecutors say the men ran a 17-year conspiracy tied to tips on mergers that Kluger stole while working at high-octane law firms. They have yet to enter pleas in the case. Twelve single-spaced pages of a criminal complaint detail nervous calls that Kluger or Bauer had with an unnamed co-conspirator, once they thought the government was on their tails. \"I got rid of my computer,\" Kluger was recorded as saying on March 17. \"I got rid of my iPhone where I had looked up some stock quotes. Those are gone. I mean history. Gone.\" Bauer was recorded a day later as needing more effort to dump his prepaid cellphone. \"I broke the phone in half and went to McDonald\\'s and put it in two different garbage cans,\" he said, according to the complaint. \"Someone was watching me. I thought it was an FBI agent. And I asked him, \\'Do you know me? You look familiar.\\'\" Prosecutors say hedge fund manager Donald Longueuil, a defendant in another insider trading case, used a similar modus operandi. They contend he once took to the streets of Manhattan at 2 a.m. to find places to toss a flash drive and two hard drives that had incriminating evidence. \"I go on like a 20-block walk,\" he said in a recorded conversation. \"And threw the shit in the back of like random garbage trucks, different garbage trucks ... four different garbage trucks.\" Then there were Bonnie and Yonni -- former Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) assistant Bonnie Hoxie and her boyfriend Yonni Sebbag. Last year, Sebbag tried to sell Disney secrets that Hoxie learned at her job to some 30 hedge funds and other investors. Prosecutors said he used a FedEx Kinko\\'s computer for the deed. Bad idea. Google found the computer, and several funds went to the authorities. Both defendants admitted their guilt. Sebbag was sentenced to 27 months in prison. Hoxie got probation. CANADA TOO Two years ago, Canadian prosecutors said lawyer Gil Cornblum and his friend Stanko Grmovsek relied on pay phones for several years as part of a 14-year insider trading conspiracy based on secrets Cornblum learned at his job. Cornblum committed suicide by jumping from a Toronto bridge in October 2009, a day before Grmovsek pleaded guilty. Prosecutors say Rajaratnam, a one-time billionaire, also tried to cover his tracks. Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty. He is set to begin his defense next week in Manhattan federal court, in Wall Street\\'s bigger insider trading case since the prosecutions of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken more than two decades ago. Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey & Co consultant arrested with Rajaratnam and now cooperating with the government, last month testified to having lolled with his longtime friend in a pair of deck chairs in Miami Beach, just prior to their arrests. \"You know, Anil, I\\'m told there\\'s a gentleman who used to work for me and he\\'s now wearing a wire,\" Kumar recalled Rajaratnam as saying. \"You should be careful,\" Kumar said he responded. \"You should make prepaid phone calls to me.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by John Wallace)', 'date': ' Fri Apr 8, 2011 3:15pm EDT\\n', 'title': ' Insider trading handbook, Rule 1: Keep it quiet\\n', 'author': ' By Jonathan Stempel\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/us-insidertrading-idUSTRE7376M120110408\\n\\n \\n\\n NEW YORK  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Johnson & Johnson will pay $78 million to settle U.S. and UK charges that it paid bribes and kickbacks to win business overseas, the first big drug company to settle since the Obama administration began its scrutiny of the industry more than a year ago. \\n\\n Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay a $21.4 million fine to settle Justice Department criminal charges and pay more than $48.6 million in disgorgement and interest to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agencies said on Friday. The allegations date back to 1998 and involved sham contracts, bribes and kickbacks paid by J&J units to officials and doctors in Greece, Iraq, Poland and Romania to help earn millions of dollars in profits, according to authorities. The New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant also settled a similar complaint with the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office for conduct by its DePuy Inc subsidiary, agreeing to pay some $7.9 million plus prosecution costs. The U.S. Justice Department announced in November 2009 that it would focus on prosecuting those in the pharmaceutical industry who try to bribe foreign officials for preferential treatment of their products, leading to a wide-ranging probe. U.S. authorities praised the cooperation by the company, its remedial efforts and said that it helped identify improper practices in the industry. The criminal fine was reduced in light of the company\\'s cooperation. \"We are committed to holding corporations accountable for bribing foreign officials while, at the same time, giving meaningful credit to companies that self-report and cooperate with our investigations,\" said Mythili Raman, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ criminal division. MORE SETTLEMENTS COMING? Other companies have disclosed similar probes and experts believe more settlements are in the offing. Eli Lilly & Co has previously said that it was under scrutiny by the U.S. government over its compliance with bribery laws in a number of countries including Poland. The company has said it was cooperating with authorities. Baxter International has also said that it has received a request from the Justice Department and SEC for information about its practices overseas related to U.S. bribery laws and that it was cooperating as well. The settlement comes at a tough time for J&J, which has been grappling with recalls of Tylenol and other products. The company has recalled more than 300 million bottles and packages of adult and children\\'s consumer medicines in the past 15 months. Although no injuries have been linked to the recalls, they have sullied J&J\\'s reputation, pressured its share price and sparked Congressional investigations. Johnson & Johnson shares reversed gains after news of the bribery settlement emerged. They were down 4 cents at $59.44 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Authorities accused J&J units of paying bribes to public doctors in Greece to select its surgical implants and in Romania to prescribe its medicines, earning the company millions of dollars in profits. J&J subsidiaries were also accused of paying bribes to public doctors and hospital administrators in Poland to win contracts and of paying kickbacks to Iraq to win 19 contracts under the U.N.\\'s Oil for Food Program. Iraq had demanded that companies pay a 10 percent fee in order to do business with the Saddam Hussein government, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement. \"More than four years ago, we went to the (U.S.) government to report improper payments and have taken full responsibility for these actions,\" J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Weldon said in a statement. J&J did not admit or deny the SEC\\'s allegations but acknowledged responsibility in the Justice Department case for the actions of its units, employees and agents who made the improper payments. Under the settlement, J&J will enter into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department.

      "{'text': ' They\\'re sleek, sexy and fun. They\\'re also revolutionizing the way financial advisers do business. \\n\\n A host of adviser-specific apps have taken iPads and other tablets from nifty playthings to seductive business tools that can dazzle and truly educate clients, advocates say. \"It\\'s really a new paradigm,\" said David Wisehaupt, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Wisehaupt Bray Asset Management, a unit of Chicago-based independent brokerage HighTower. \"I\\'m with a client, be they young or old, and ... they sort of can\\'t help themselves -- before the meeting is over, they\\'re manipulating the images on the screen.\" Wisehaupt, a 29-year financial services industry veteran who works with high-net-worth clients, said the charts, research and portfolio analytics he displays on his tablet screen connect with clients more than one-sided dissertations or lectures. The interactive experience helps clients retain more information and feel more secure about his stewardship of their assets, he said. DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY Bill Winterberg, whose technology consulting firm FP Pad in Dallas, Texas, specializes in working with independent advisers, calls tablets a \"disruptive technology\" that improves productivity and mobility. He pointed to apps that enable advisers to access customer relationship management and portfolio management tools. For instance, there\\'s Orion Advisor Services\\' MobileAdvisor app, which displays portfolios, performance information and contact information. It also allows advisers using Orion\\'s platform to rebrand the app, so clients download it, log in, track their portfolios, and view videos that the adviser provides. For security purposes, the data is kept on the Omaha-based company\\'s servers rather than directly on the tablet. Security is the primary compliance concern for advisers using iPads, Winterberg said. At a minimum, he recommends pass code locks and password protection for the tablets. Users also can use a service from Apple called MobileMe that homes in on lost iPads and allows all data to be erased remotely if the tablet is online. INTELLIGENT PAPER Some brokerage firms are beginning to embrace tablet technology. Canada\\'s No. 3 lender, Bank of Nova Scotia, is looking at arming its wealth managers with Research In Motion\\'s upcoming BlackBerry PlayBook. Firms like Charles Schwab Corp, TD Ameritrade, which offer custody and business services to independent registered investment advisers and others have been introducing apps that allow advisers and their clients to do some trading directly from their iPads. HighTower\\'s Wisehaupt is a fan of an application called LogMeIn that connects him via his iPad to his office desktop if a secure Wi-Fi or other 3G mobile connection is available. When a client has a question, the information is always at his fingertips. \"Signing in, getting it and showing it to clients live is powerful,\" he said. Other popular web-based applications keep track of call records, conversation notes and updated contact information. \"It\\'s the convenience factor,\" said Winterberg. \"They can do the same with the laptop, but they\\'re not going to get the battery life from a laptop, and they don\\'t get necessarily the portability factor of being able to just hold it in one hand and look up this information.\" There is also the social factor. If a client is worried about retirement and the adviser is busy typing away behind a keyboard, it can seem disrespectful, said Alessandro Tonchia, founder and director of Finantix, which offers a suite of wealth management apps for iPads, iPhones, and Android-smartphones. \"The iPad has the same social acceptability as a piece of paper, but it has all the power of an interactive device,\" Tonchia said. \"We present it is as intelligent paper.\" ($1=$0.96 Canadian) (Reporting by John McCrank; editing by Rob Wilson)', 'date': ' Fri Apr 8, 2011 11:30am EDT\\n', 'title': \" Wealth management?

Rajaratnam lawyer Terence Lynam told the judge on Friday he planned to call two former Galleon employees, including its one-time chief operating officer Rick Schutte. Schutte is expected to back the defense\\'s argument that research, analysis and market speculation, not material company secrets, guided trading at Galleon, which had $7 billion under management at its peak. Former Galleon analyst Stephen Granoff may also take the witness stand. In what prosecutors have called the biggest probe of insider trading at hedge funds on record, Sri Lankan-born Rajaratnam, 53, is charged with 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. Prosecutors have played numerous wiretapped recordings of Rajaratnam\\'s phone calls with high-placed friends in corporate America. The government contends he made more than $50 million in illicit trading profits between 2003 and March 2009. The trial, which began in early March, was expected to last up to two months. But defense attorneys said they might take only two days to present their witnesses, resting their case as early as Tuesday. A looming U.S. government shutdown was not expected to have an impact on the Rajaratnam court proceedings. The impasse was not mentioned at a court hearing on the case on Friday. At the hearing, where no jurors were present, Rajaratnam\\'s lawyers told U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell they first planned to call two witnesses to refute earlier testimony from former Galleon employee and government cooperator Adam Smith. Hedge fund owner John Pernell and lawyer Robert Hotz will be called to the stand to contradict what former Smith told jurors, Lynam said. Smith, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy in January, testified that he supplied Rajaratnam with inside stock tips from a friend who worked as an investment banker. Hotz is a partner at Rajaratnam defense law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Pernell owns Polaris Investment Partners Inc. Prosecutors said they would file papers later on Friday asking the judge not to let the two men testify. The judge on Friday also allowed defense expert Gregg Jarrell, a professor at the University of Rochester\\'s William Simon School of Business, to testify next week. Prosecutors had objected to parts of his proposed testimony. Rajaratnam, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, has sat silently amid his lawyers at the trial as prosecutors brought on a parade of witnesses and played recordings of his telephone conversations. Asked by the judge whether Rajaratnam would take the stand, defense lawyer John Dowd said he would tell the prosecutors \"in a timely way.\" The case is USA v Raj Rajaratnam et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.

Those looming departures, along with Chief Financial Officer Patrick Campbell\\'s upcoming retirement, could signal some of the top brass at the maker of products ranging from Post-It notes to optical films used in flat-panel televisions no longer think they have a shot at the corner office. \"Given that you now have three executives leaving in a relatively short period of time, there is a possibility that there was some thought that they may have had a chance at that position, which is not the case at this point,\" said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. The company has named replacements from within 3M for all three executives, who are due to retire in May and June. Julie Bushman will succeed Lobey, overseeing the safety, security and protection business, Ian Hardgrove will replace MacDonald, heading marketing and sales, and David Meline will take over from Campbell.

Both Buckley and his predecessor James McNerney, a former General Electric Co ( GE.N ) executive who now heads Boeing Co ( BA.N ), were brought in from the outside. McNerney, who joined in 2000, is credited with vastly improving 3M\\'s profit margins at a time when they were low while analysts say Buckley\\'s mark on the company has been a resurgence of research. But analysts expect the 109-year old company, which employs more than 80,000 people worldwide, to choose its next leader from among its current executive ranks. Even with the current round of retirements, 3M has a deep bench of executives with decades of experience at the company, including Inge Thulin, executive vice president of international operations and Brad Sauer, executive vice president of its health care unit. \"If you started to see a lot of the vice president heads of the divisions starting to say, \\'I\\'m out of here,\\' that would be more concerning to me,\" Fleck said. \"It\\'s encouraging to read reports that the company wants to return to promoting from within.\" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)', 'date': ' Fri Apr 8, 2011 1:18pm EDT\\n', 'title': \" Two more top executives retire as 3M mulls CEO's future\\n\", 'author': ' By  Scott Malone\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/us-3m-idUSTRE7375LJ20110408\\n\\n \\n\\n BOSTON  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Democratic and Republican leaders traded blame on Friday in a budget impasse that threatened to shut down the U.S. government within hours and idle hundreds of thousands of federal workers. \\n\\n With a midnight (0400 GMT on Saturday) deadline looming, President Barack Obama\\'s aides and U.S. lawmakers struggled for a deal over government funding for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30. But the two sides could not even agree on what issues were holding up an agreement. Democrats said they were at odds over federal funding for birth control. Republicans said spending cuts were the issue. Without an agreement, money to operate the federal government for the next six months would run out at midnight on Friday (0400 GMT on Saturday) and agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service would begin a partial shutdown. Congressional staffers were making some progress in last-minute talks, a Republican aide said. But it was unclear whether a deal, even for a few extra days of stopgap funding, could be struck in time. Obama scrapped a family weekend trip to Williamsburg, Virginia, to stay home and monitor events. The bitter political fight raised questions about the ability of Obama and a divided U.S. Congress to deal with bigger issues looming down the road, from raising the federal debt ceiling to reining in budget deficits, as the 2012 presidential election campaign gathers steam. \"They\\'ve got to be laughing at us right now\" in China, said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry. \"How terrific that the United States of America can\\'t make a decision.\" The leadership of the world\\'s lone remaining superpower has been consumed for days by the budgetary infighting that could bring large swathes of government to a standstill. The White House said a shutdown would idle about 800,000 federal government workers and could slow the U.S. economic recovery. Vital services such as defense, law enforcement, emergency medical care and air traffic control would continue. Without a deal, many official websites would darken and furloughed government workers would be required to turn off Blackberries. Trash would go uncollected in Washington, and national parks and monuments like the Statue of Liberty in New York would close. Investment firm Goldman Sachs estimates a government shutdown lasting more than a week could cost the economy $8 billion in missed federal spending, dragging down growth. AT ODDS Republican and Democratic aides said negotiators have agreed to $38 billion in cuts but remain at odds over where they would fall. Republicans are resisting a Democratic proposal to cut $1.7 billion from defense. Obama called House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the top Democrat, about the continuing talks. Reid said the final issue was a Republican push to give states greater discretion over federal funds earmarked for birth control and women\\'s health clinics. Democrats say that would give Republican governors license to block those funds. \"Republicans want to shut down the government because they think there\\'s nothing more important than keeping women from getting cancer screenings. This is indefensible and everyone should be outraged,\" Reid said on the Senate floor. But Boehner said the final stumbling block was spending cuts that Republicans say are needed to rein in budget deficits hitting $1.4 trillion a year. \"We\\'re not going to roll over and sell out the American people like has been done time and time again in Washington. When we say we\\'re serious about cutting spending, we\\'re damn serious about it.\" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he expected lawmakers to reach agreement on a spending plan and avert a government shutdown. Fear that a government shutdown could hurt economic growth on the margins pressured the dollar and U.S. Treasury prices on Friday. Longer-term, investors are looking at the last shutdown, in 1995, when predictions of spending cuts made government debt and the dollar more appealing and both rose. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, noted the budget debate is raising concern among foreign investors about how the U.S. government will deal with the budget deficit, federal debt and the budget talks for the 2012 fiscal year, which begins October 1. The showdown is the biggest test of leadership for Obama, a Democrat, and congressional leaders since Republicans made big gains and took control of the House of Representatives in elections last November. The confrontation carries big political risks for both parties, who could be seen by voters as failing to make compromises. But Boehner is under pressure to stand firm in the talks from Tea Party conservatives who helped fuel last year\\'s big Republican election gains. The budget battle has dominated Obama\\'s agenda even as he struggles to balance Americans\\' chief concerns -- jobs and the economy -- with foreign policy challenges topped by Middle East turmoil and U.S. military involvement in the Libyan conflict. Reid said Senate Democrats planned to vote on a one-week funding extension that would fund the Pentagon for the year but include no spending cuts to give more time for negotiations. Obama threatened to veto a bill passed by the Republican-led House for a one-week extension that included another $12 billion in spending cuts. Republicans said they would not allow a vote on a stopgap measure to keep the government operating beyond midnight on Friday unless it contains additional spending cuts. Any deal reached at this point would require several days to implement, meaning Congress will have to pass some sort of short-term bill to keep the government functioning.

      "{'text': ' After piloting the No. 2 U.S. bank through the financial crisis relatively unscathed, JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is now being extremely well rewarded. \\n\\n Dimon\\'s total compensation jumped nearly 1,500 percent to $20.8 million in 2010 from $1.3 million a year earlier, based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\'s compensation formula, a regulatory filing showed. Dimon did even better in terms of the value of money and shares actually received: his salary, bonus and stock and options from grants made largely in previous years that were actually exercised in 2010 were worth around $42 million. By way of comparison, real median U.S. household income was just $49,777 in 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Large pay packages for bankers who oversaw transactions that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse in 2008 have become a flash point for investors. Anger has eased, but banker pay remains a sensitive issue, especially toward lenders that took taxpayer bailout money. Many analysts view JPMorgan as the healthiest of the largest U.S. commercial banks, having skirted the worst of the credit losses that hurt many rivals including Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Citigroup Inc ( C.N ). They credit the 55-year-old Dimon, who became chief executive on December 31, 2005, for having enabled JPMorgan to quickly repay its $25 billion of bailout money. JPMorgan is also one of the first big banks to raise its dividend after passing a second Federal Reserve \"stress\" test. However, Dimon has criticized regulatory reforms by the Obama administration, saying they could crimp growth. In his annual shareholder letter posted on the bank\\'s website, Dimon said JPMorgan could earn $22 billion to $24 billion in a \"more normal\" environment, up from $17.4 billion in 2010. He said profit has fallen short because mortgage losses have been \"extraordinarily high,\" at $4 billion a year and that such losses will remain \"elevated\" for a while. THREE YEARS TO SELL HOME Dimon\\'s 2010 salary remained at $1 million. He was also awarded a $5 million bonus, nearly $8 million in stock awards and $6.2 million in option awards, according to the SEC\\'s compensation formula. His 2010 compensation also included $579,624 worth of perks, including $421,458 of \"moving expenses,\" $95,293 to use company aircraft and $45,730 for personal automobile use. Most of the rest went toward home security. Like many Americans who have had trouble selling their homes, Dimon did too. The moving expenses relate to the sale in 2010 of Dimon\\'s Chicago-area home, in which he had lived while heading Bank One Corp that was sold to JPMorgan in 2004. Dimon put the home up for sale in 2007 when his family moved to New York. Dimon\\'s total compensation in 2010 fell short of the $35.8 million he was awarded in 2008, according to the SEC formula. Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein saw compensation jump to $14.1 million in 2010 from $1 million, another regulatory filing shows. Other bank CEOs had lower compensation in 2010. Wells Fargo & Co\\'s ( WFC.N ) John Stumpf saw compensation fall to $19 million from $21.3 million. Bank of America\\'s Brian Moynihan saw compensation fall 70 percent to about $1.9 million, although in early 2011 he got a $9.1 million bonus. Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit\\'s compensation was $1 in 2010, but his salary alone has risen to $1.75 million in 2011. JPMorgan shares closed down 0.5 percent at $47.40 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

      "{'text': ' Americans still expect inflation to remain stable, making it unlikely that recent spikes in commodity costs will lead to runaway increases in prices, a top Federal Reserve official said on Friday. \\n\\n Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, said he expects moderate economic growth to gradually bring down U.S. unemployment, which has come down rapidly in recent months but remains at an elevated 8.8 percent. A mix of demand from rapidly growing emerging economies and fears of supply disruptions from a wave of pro-democracy protests in the Middle East and North Africa have driven up the price of oil and other commodities, sparking inflation fears. U.S. crude is trading above $110 a barrel, and the average price of gasoline stands around $3.70 a gallon. But Lockhart said he expected commodity prices to stabilize and have a minimal effect on underlying U.S. inflation trends, even if costly fuel did put a dent on household budgets. \"With longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable -- and predicting that commodity price growth will stabilize -- my view is that current monetary policy is appropriate,\" Lockhart told the Knoxville Economics Club. Lockhart has argued recently the Fed should complete its $600 billion bond-buying stimulus program as scheduled by the end of June, saying there has not been enough compelling evidence to warrant a reversal. \"Historically, prices for industrial commodities have tended to exert a relatively small effect on most consumer prices,\" Lockhart said. \"This is not to say there will be no pass-through effect on inflation. The point is the effect is likely to be muted.\" In particular, he said there was little evidence of upward pressure on wages as the labor market continues to struggle. The European Central Bank raised official interest rates on Wednesday in a move that many saw as the opening salvo for a cycle of tightening. Still, the Fed is unlikely to follow suit in the near-term, as it continues to promise to keep rates at very low levels for an \"extended period.\" Lockhart said he did not see a major impact from the ECB\\'s rate hike on the Fed\\'s thinking. He said Fed officials were monitoring the European debt situation closely in the wake of Portugal\\'s decision to request a eurozone bailout, but added that he does not expect major ripples for the United States. CONFIDENCE-BUSTER Lockhart said he remained worried about the housing sector, which has been showing signs of further deterioration in recent months. He said this slump was weighing on consumer confidence, countering some of the positive effects of an improving labor market outlook. Lockhart credited a strong rebound in manufacturing for a good deal of the economic recovery\\'s underlying strength. \"Consumer confidence and spending have been weaker than many were expecting,\" he said. \"On the positive side, the labor market has improved in recent months, and the industrial activity data remain very strong.\" Given the still-fragile nature of the recovery, Lockhart said Fed officials should avoid discussing their exit strategy in too great a detail, lest they send the wrong signal to the public and financial markets about the direction of rates. In response to the deepest recession in generations, the Fed not only slashed interest rates to near zero but also committed to buy more than $2 trillion in government bonds and mortgage debt. U.S. gross domestic product expanded 3.1 percent at an annual clip in the fourth quarter, not as strong a rebound as is normally seen after a steep downturn.

      "{'text': ' From Kuala Lumpur to Atlanta, Brent crude is gaining momentum as the global oil pricing reference of choice for producers and consumers, bolstering the Intercontinental Exchange in a battle of benchmarks for the world\\'s most widely traded commodity. \\n\\n Three months after a blowout in the premium for ICE\\'s European Brent crude futures over the New York Mercantile Exchange\\'s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract stoked speculation about a shift in liquidity, changes in the way companies hedge have emerged in both the East and the West. Malaysia\\'s Petronas this week dropped national crude Tapis as the benchmark for its exports in favor of ICE-related dated Brent. The move dealt a blow to the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), part owned by NYMEX, which has pushed its Oman crude contract as a replacement. Two weeks earlier, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines announced it had swapped out its previous jet fuel hedges based on the WTI contract in favor of Brent, which has more closely reflected global gasoline and jet fuel price moves than the U.S. marker. Trading volume -- a measure of a contract\\'s health and liquidity -- tilted toward Brent, although the trend was masked by a slowdown in activity at the end of the first quarter. In the past 20 days, daily turnover in NYMEX crude futures exceeded that of ICE Brent futures by about 165,000 lots, the lowest figure since 2006. On Tuesday, ICE Brent traded more than NYMEX for only the ninth time since 2004, according to Reuters data from the exchanges. If more Asian producers opt to swap the region\\'s current benchmarks -- mostly viewed as dysfunctional -- for Brent, the balance in the war for benchmark supremacy could swing more in ICE\\'s favor. \"It seems to be part of a trend,\" said Mike Wittner, Americas head of commodities research at Societe Generale. \"More and more physical oil market participants, whether they are producers, consumers or refiners, are looking at Brent as perhaps more appropriate to manage their risk.\" TWO-TIERED MARKET It is too early to say whether volumes have been permanently sapped from WTI. In January and February, as global traders hit the panic button over unrest and war in Libya, WTI had some of its best days ever, several times exceeding Brent volume by more than 500,000 lots. But that changed dramatically as the quarter wound down. \"We have seen Brent volumes surge in the past and even exceed WTI from time to time, only to slip back again,\" said Olivier Jakob, managing director of consultants Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland. \"There has been a lot of debate about which contract is more representative of the international oil market and that will continue.\" WTI has sunk to record discounts against Brent, fuelling a discussion on whether Brent better reflects global fundamentals and the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa. Brent was trading around a 32-month high above $124 on Friday, with WTI around $112. At the beginning of March, NYMEX started offering traders the ability to hedge U.S. oil product futures RBOB gasoline and heating oil against Brent on its exchange. Some say the strategic glut in landlocked U.S. crude has caused the NYMEX market to lose its link with global fundamentals. The disruption in Libyan exports as the country fights a civil war has clearly affected Brent most heavily. But the long-term cause for Brent\\'s ascent is perhaps further east, where soaring demand from Asia is lifting requirements of Middle East, Mediterranean and West African crude, mostly priced in relation to the European marker. Investors are helping Brent consolidate as a cross-continent marker for at least 70 percent of internationally traded crude because the structure of the ICE forward curve yields positive returns when rolling over positions every month, while for WTI the roll-over comes at a loss. \"Recently, one of the smartest ideas to enhance index return was to switch WTI for Brent,\" Goldman Sachs managing director for fixed income, currency and commodities Arun Assumall told Reuters in Singapore. \"Many investors would prefer to be exposed to a more global oil price, such as Brent.\" THE ASIAN GAME Malaysia\\'s move to Brent may prompt other Asian producers to follow, including Vietnam and Indonesia, entrenching Brent\\'s influence in the region and dampening efforts by the DME to draw Middle Eastern producers toward its Oman futures and away from Platts\\' Dubai/Oman assessments. Still, Malaysia\\'s crude is light and sweet, while much of the exports from the Middle East which the DME is eyeing are heavier and more sour. That may mean there is enough space for different markers to gain ground for the different grades. Brent is gaining favor as a benchmark for sweet crude in Southeast Asia, but how attractive it would be to price sour Middle East grades is another matter, said John Vautrain, director at Purvin & Gertz energy consultants in Singapore. Malaysia\\'s move to Brent \"illustrates the need and importance of reviewing pricing mechanisms used in East of Suez markets,\" the DME said in response to e-mailed questions. \"The current Dubai price assessment used for the majority of Middle Eastern crude exports into Asia suffers from a number of similar problems as Tapis as a benchmark,\" the DME said. The Dubai-based exchange said its Oman contract was the \"most appropriate\" marker. The wave of unrest sweeping the Middle East this year also raises new challenges for Oman as concerns grow the country\\'s oil output may be disrupted. Pricing agency Platts is accelerating talks with customers to find alternative crudes for delivery against its Oman benchmark, used to price more than 10 million barrels per day. \"Any event that adds urgency may play against the efforts of Oman proponents by providing them less time and a more stressful environment in which to make their case,\" said Vautrain.

      "{'text': ' The official who carried out the last government shutdown has a warning for squabbling lawmakers -- another one now could be disastrous for the economy. \\n\\n John Koskinen, who organized federal operations during two government shutdowns in 1995, said failure by Republican and Democratic lawmakers to reach a budget deal could plunge the United States back into recession. \"Things are very different today than they were in 1995,\" Koskinen, a former deputy director at the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Reuters. \"In 1995, we had a budget deficit of $200 billion, which these days looks like a rounding error. The world then was relatively peaceful -- today we are involved in three wars. The economy today is extremely fragile. We have just gone through the biggest economic challenge in 80 years. In 1995 the economy was beginning to stabilize. \"A government shutdown will take up to a million workers -- government workers and contractors -- out of the economy. Another recession is a real possibility,\\'\" he said. Investment firm Goldman Sachs estimated a government shutdown lasting more than a week could cost the economy $8 billion in missed federal spending, dragging down growth. In 1995, the first shutdown lasted one week, around Thanksgiving. The other saw a three-week closure that finally ended when Congress reached a budget deal on the first Saturday in January 1996. NO PLAN Koskinen said there had never been a widespread government shutdown before 1995, and no government agency had a plan on how to manage one. During the summer of 1995, with a shutdown looming, Koskinen asked each government agency to supply a shutdown blueprint, including a list of which workers were deemed essential and nonessential. \"It was my idea,\" Koskinen said, \"but it was Justice Department language.\" He said there were unforeseen consequences in 1995, and lessons learned. For example, it is illegal for government workers to show up at work if they are not being paid. But many still showed up for duty. \"We had to bolt doors,\" Koskinen said. If there is a shutdown this time, he said, \"I think employees are much more aware now that they cannot work. But with the Internet and BlackBerry use today, I am sure some will try and work from home. That is why there is talk of people being forced to hand in their BlackBerrys.\" Koskinen said the procedure to shut government agencies almost takes care of itself. While the federal government can borrow money and run up huge deficits to fund itself, it is a crime for a federal agency to spend one cent more than the money Congress has appropriated for it. Each federal agency has a bank account to pay its staff and fund its duties. Once that bank account is empty, \"in layman\\'s terms, you cannot overdraw that account. It is a crime.\" Koskinen said in 1995 the Internet was in its infancy. Today, most people rely on websites to get their information about the government. \"People will assume this information will be still be available if there is a shutdown this time round. It won\\'t. These websites will close down.\" (Editing by  Vicki Allen )', 'date': ' Fri Apr 8, 2011 2:01pm EDT\\n', 'title': \" Veteran of 1995 shutdown says don't repeat\\n\", 'author': ' By Tim Reid\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/us-usa-budget-lessons-interview-idUSTRE7375TK20110408\\n\\n \\n\\n WASHINGTON  ('}\n",

Jefferies said late Thursday afternoon that it planned to raise $500 million in the offering. The $490 million in proceeds was net of underwriting fees. Jefferies also said on Friday that it plans to issue senior notes. The company did not say how much capital it intends to raise through that offering or whether it will retire other existing debt, which some analysts consider expensive. Jefferies is preparing to purchase a large trading operation from Prudential Financial Inc ( PRU.N ). The company said it will pay $430 million for the business, to be called Jefferies Bache, which trades commodities and derivatives on and off exchanges. After the deal was announced on Thursday, Jefferies shares came under pressure, dropping as much as 2.9 percent and finishing down 1.6 percent at $24.71. The shares were off 0.7 percent at $24.55 Friday morning. Ticonderoga Securities analyst Douglas Sipkin estimates the equity raise and acquisition will dilute Jefferies shareholders' stakes by 1 percent to 7 percent, depending on the earnings Bache can deliver. Bache reported pretax earnings of $17 million in 2010 on revenue of $220 million. Though Sipkin expects Jefferies shares to remain under pressure in the near term, he thinks the equity raise is a good move because it delevers Jefferies' balance sheet and increases book value. Gimme Credit analyst Kathleen Shanley has pointed out that Jefferies' balance sheet is more leveraged than that of larger rivals such as Goldman Sachs Inc ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and that its long-term debt is more expensive. A Jefferies spokesman contacted by Reuters did not immediately provide more information about the stock and bond offerings. Jefferies, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Natixis Bleichroeder LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc were the joint bookrunners for the stock offering, while BNY Mellon Capital Markets LLC and BMO Capital Markets Corp acted as senior co-managers and Rabo Securities USA Inc acted as co-manager.

It shut down its two largest offerings in 2008 after investors asked for roughly $2 billion back. It was later acquired by Fortress Management, a New York private equity and hedge fund manager. Gruss would approve all cash transfers at the company, the suit said. and would improperly transfer money between accounts to meet constant cash shortages. At one point in 2005, the SEC said Gruss authorized the use of $3.8 million in client money to pay for part of a $17.95 million private plane for the fund.

      "{'text': ' The end of super-cheap money from the Federal Reserve is trumping corporate earnings results as a key risk to hedge for stock investors. \\n\\n Investors are looking forward to fewer price gyrations during this earnings season but are worried about how withdrawal of the Fed\\'s extraordinary monetary support, expected in June, will affect shares. Normally the earnings reporting period is prone to ups and downs, but strong profit growth should keep volatility subdued. That\\'s lessened the cost of hedging risk, and some investors have identified the end of the Fed\\'s quantitative easing effort as something to hedge against. Some are willing to pay more to protect against declines a couple months down the road. \"It looks like all the markets from equities to currencies are pricing in some sort of the continuation of the Fed\\'s quantitative easing policies,\" said Joe Cusick, senior market analyst at Chicago-based brokerage firm optionsXpress. \"While that gets debated between now and June, we are going to see some potential for renewed short-term volatility,\" Cusick said. Aluminum maker Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) will unofficially kick off the U.S. earnings season next Monday. Profit reports are expected to support U.S. stocks with first-quarter S&P 500 earnings are expected to show 11.5 percent year-over-year growth, according to Thomson Reuters. Investors will be scrutinizing early reports to get a clue of the sentiment for future earnings guidance and the economic landscape for the last two quarters of the year. \"The prospect of good earnings in a period of still-low interest rates is supporting equities, even as the European debt crisis, higher crude oil prices, and other events overseas add some earnings risk longer-term,\" said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a barometer of investor anxiety known as the VIX .VIX, is at relatively low levels. It also indicates S&P 500 index  .SPX  options are getting cheaper in the near term. The 10-day historical volatility for the SPX dropped below 7 percent on Thursday, a sign of very calm markets, compared to 19 percent two weeks ago. The VIX was lately trading at around the 17 level, after rising to 31.28 on March 16 in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake crisis. With the stock market near two-and-a-half year highs, in-line earnings may not be rewarded as they have been in past earnings cycles and could lead to disappointment. Still, the expectation of gradual tightening of Fed policy is potentially more worrying. The Fed is in the middle of a $600 billion bond-buying program that has been credited with helping to underpin the stock market\\'s rally. Investors are starting to buy protection against future headline risk as a result. VIX futures are pricing in some fear in the back months. Contracts from June to November expect the VIX to rise to above a 21 to 24 reading in the second half of the year. \"Near-term options as measured by the VIX are getting less expensive but we see buying demand for further out-of-the money puts in the SPX as a hedging tool,\" said Chris McKhann, an analyst at stock and options website optionMonster.com. This is also reflected in the CBOE SKEW Index, .SKEWX which measures demand for out-of-the-money puts compared to out-of-the-money calls, McKhann said. The greater the skew, the more investors are willing to pay for the out-of-the-money protective put positions than the upside call positions. \"This means those seeking protection for the downside in equities are likely best served by buying near-term at-the-money put options, which are relatively cheap and selling out-of-the-money puts--taking advantage of that skew,\" McKhann said.

      "{'text': ' U.S. stocks fell late on Friday as a spike in oil prices revived worries that inflation would derail the recovery, jolting a market that had been treading water ahead of corporate earnings. \\n\\n The uncertain outcome of budget talks in Washington and the prospect of a U.S. government shutdown as a midnight deadline loomed spurred investors to buy protection ahead of the weekend. Many traders bought short-term put options on the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ( SPY.P ). \"The tape is heading south in light volume. People are hoping that nothing bad happens over the weekend,\" said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The surge in oil prices drove down shares of airlines and transportation companies. The Arca Airline index  .XAL  shed 2.7 percent and the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT fell 1.7 percent. Brent crude futures settled above $126 a barrel, the highest level in 32 months, as the weak dollar drove up commodities and intense fighting in Libya raised fears of prolonged supply cuts. Trading volumes remained low, a sign that investors are holding off major new bets ahead of the release of quarterly earnings beginning next week. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 29.59 points, or 0.24 percent, at 12,379.90. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  was down 5.36 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,328.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 15.73 points, or 0.56 percent, at 2,780.41. For the week, the Dow rose 0.03 percent while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each lost 0.3 percent. Trading volume was 6.47 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, compared with last year\\'s estimated daily average of 8.47 billion. The S&P faces resistance around 1,345, near its 2011 high. Many analysts believe earnings could be the catalyst that pushes the benchmark index through that resistance. \"If the earnings next week are robust enough, we might go above 1,350, which is the top of the trading range. But since the market is very complacent, we might easily turn the other way if we see a negative outlook,\" said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. The earnings season will begin unofficially when Dow component Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) reports results after the market\\'s close on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) are due to report later in the week. Bullishness has risen to levels not seen since last December before earnings, according to a survey by Investors Intelligence. Bucking the downtrend on Friday, commodity-related shares rose with higher oil and metals prices. Occidental Petroleum Corp ( OXY.N ) rose 2.6 percent to $103.72 and the S&P Energy index .GSPE was up 0.4 percent. Copper rose 2.5 percent while gold hit record highs on Friday and silver reached its strongest level since early 1980, as investors snapped up inflation-sensitive raw materials as a hedge. U.S.-listed shares of miner Rio Tinto Plc ( RIO.N ) rose 2.1 percent. The White House and Congress faced a midnight deadline to break a budget deadlock. Democratic and Republican leaders said there was still no overall deal on government funding for the rest of the fiscal year.

      "{'text': ' Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) has bought a 12 percent stake worth more than $900 million in China\\'s Taikang Life Insurance Co Ltd, giving the Wall Street giant a foothold into the world\\'s biggest insurance market. \\n\\n Goldman\\'s long-overdue purchase could pave the way for Taikang\\'s planned initial public offering next year, bankers and analysts said, as the insurer seeks more capital to fund its rapid growth in China. Credit Suisse estimates China\\'s life insurance market --which generated $124 billion premium income in 2009 -- will grow more than 20 percent per annum for the next decade. But some analysts doubt if Goldman can earn the same big returns that Carlyle Group CYL.UL and TPG Capital TPG.UL reaped from their investments in Chinese insurance companies. \"Goldman has come in pretty late into the game relative to Taikang\\'s planned IPO timeline, so the returns might not be as high as previous investors have got,\" said Sally Yim, senior analyst of financial institutions group at Moody\\'s. Carlyle\\'s investment in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co ( 2601.HK ) is already on course for its best ever exit, after it sold down a $2.6 billion stake over the past few months. Last year, TPG sold a $2.4 billion stake in China\\'s Ping An Insurance Group Co ( 2318.HK ), which analysts estimate delivered strong profits for the buyout fund. RIVAL BIDDERS Goldman is not new to the China insurance industry, having previously bought a stake in Ping An along with Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) in 1994. But Goldman is using its balance sheet to buy the Taikang stake, while the previous investment was made through its private equity arm. Goldman acquired the Taikang stake from French insurer AXA SA ( AXAF.PA ), which last month said it agreed to sell its 15.6 percent in Taikang to a group of investors for $1.2 billion. Goldman beat several bidders, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co ( KKR.N ), Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) and Singapore\\'s Temasek Holdings TEM.UL, to win the Taikang auction. China Guardian Auctions Co. and New Deal TEDA Investment Co., Ltd were the others who bought the shares sold by AXA, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said on its web site. AXA put its stake on the block nearly two years ago and Goldman was picked as the preferred bidder last year. The stake purchase was approved by CIRC, Goldman and Taikang said in a joint statement. Taikang and New China Life Insurance Co. are among insurers which are looking to tap the public market over the course of the next year or so. Taikang has about $44 billion in assets and 54 million clients across China. \"The regulators are a bit reluctant to allow insurance companies to raise subordinate debt to replenish capital. So all these companies are looking to shareholders to help inject capital to support growth,\" Yim of Moody\\'s added.

The Trustee\\'s Office, which is the Justice Department agency charged with overseeing the administration of bankruptcy cases, said Borders failed to show that the proposed payments complied with the bankruptcy code. \"Seeking the approval of the bonus motion at this early juncture, prior to the debtors finalizing their business and operational plans is not a sound exercise of the debtors\\' business judgment,\" said Tracy Hope Davis, the U.S. Trustee, in the filing.

      "{'text': ' Dueling views on the outlook for inflation and U.S. monetary policy by two top Federal Reserve officials on Friday underscored divisions at the central bank as it nears the end of a controversial stimulus program. \\n\\n In comments that reflect the majority view at the Fed -- including Chairman Ben Bernanke -- Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said it was unlikely that recent spikes in commodity costs will lead to runaway increases in prices. \"With longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable -- and predicting that commodity price growth will stabilize -- my view is that current monetary policy is appropriate,\" Lockhart told the Knoxville Economics Club in Tennessee. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed and a self-proclaimed inflation hawk, took a divergent view, saying that prolonged easy monetary policy could compound what might otherwise be transitory inflationary pressures. Warning of \"unpleasant\" U.S. inflation data ahead, Fisher called on the U.S. central bank to stop \"spiking the punch bowl\" with more accommodative policy and said the Fed may even need to end its $600 billion bond-buying program early. \"No amount of further accommodation by the Fed would be wise,\" he told the Society of American Business Editors and Writers in Dallas. \"Indeed, it may well be that we should consider curtailing what remains of QE2,\" he said, referring to the Fed\\'s second round of quantitative easing, which is slated to end in June. The prices of oil and other commodities have spiked, sparking inflation fears, hit by both strong demand from rapidly growing emerging economies and fears of supply disruptions amid a wave of pro-democracy protests in the Middle East and North Africa. U.S. crude has been trading at the highest prices since September 2008, rising above $110 a barrel, and the average price of gasoline stands around $3.70 a gallon. But Lockhart said that while costly fuel is putting a dent in household budgets, the overall effect on inflation is likely to be muted. In part that\\'s because high unemployment -- at 8.8 percent in March -- is keeping wage-driven inflation under wraps, he said. Conceding that point as \"reasonable,\" Fisher -- who holds a voting seat this year on the Fed\\'s policy-setting panel -- nevertheless said the Fed should not compound the risk of fueling inflation by adding more liquidity. Several other hawkish Fed policy makers have pushed noisily in recent weeks for the central bank to heed signs of incipient inflation and to begin to think about raising rates, as the European Central Bank did on Thursday for the first time since 2008. But Bernanke and other core members of the Fed\\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee have said the recovery is too fragile to withdraw support yet. Given the still-fragile nature of the recovery, Lockhart said Fed officials should avoid discussing their exit strategy in too great detail, lest they send the wrong signal to the public and financial markets about the direction of interest rates. In response to the deepest recession in generations, the Fed slashed interest rates to near zero and also committed to buy more than $2 trillion in government bonds and mortgage debt. U.S. gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent the fourth quarter, a rebound which is less robust than normally seen after a steep downturn.

      "{'text': ' Here\\'s some advice for anyone hoping not to get caught in an insider trading web: Shut up. \\n\\n After the October 2009 arrest of Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, who was wiretapped by the FBI, the world woke to a new era of prosecutorial tactics in insider trading probes. For those considering crossing the line, the changes may make insider trading seem a vocation not worth the risk. Emails and other forms of electronic communication can be traced. Destroying old-fashioned snail mail or hard drives will not work if the government gets a tip it is being done. And don\\'t talk to people. There is no certainty that what is said will remain private. Indeed, recent phone recordings make some accused wrongdoers come across as Keystone Kriminals. \"Insider trading today is a lot more difficult to get away with than it was 20 years ago,\" said Andrew Stoltmann, a principal at Stoltmann Law Offices PC in Chicago who has handled civil insider trading cases. \"Prosecutors really are cracking down. And there are electronic trails left behind.\" GARBAGE CANS AND GARBAGE TRUCKS A recent proliferation of cases against fund managers, traders and lawyers shows a new aggression, especially in the use of wiretaps and recorded phone calls to build cases. The latest illustration: this week\\'s arrests of lawyer Matthew Kluger and trader Garrett Bauer. Prosecutors say the men ran a 17-year conspiracy tied to tips on mergers that Kluger stole while working at high-octane law firms. They have yet to enter pleas in the case. Twelve single-spaced pages of a criminal complaint detail nervous calls that Kluger or Bauer had with an unnamed co-conspirator, once they thought the government was on their tails. \"I got rid of my computer,\" Kluger was recorded as saying on March 17. \"I got rid of my iPhone where I had looked up some stock quotes. Those are gone. I mean history. Gone.\" Bauer was recorded a day later as needing more effort to dump his prepaid cellphone. \"I broke the phone in half and went to McDonald\\'s and put it in two different garbage cans,\" he said, according to the complaint. \"Someone was watching me. I thought it was an FBI agent. And I asked him, \\'Do you know me? You look familiar.\\'\" Prosecutors say hedge fund manager Donald Longueuil, a defendant in another insider trading case, used a similar modus operandi. They contend he once took to the streets of Manhattan at 2 a.m. to find places to toss a flash drive and two hard drives that had incriminating evidence. \"I go on like a 20-block walk,\" he said in a recorded conversation. \"And threw the shit in the back of like random garbage trucks, different garbage trucks ... four different garbage trucks.\" Then there were Bonnie and Yonni -- former Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) assistant Bonnie Hoxie and her boyfriend Yonni Sebbag. Last year, Sebbag tried to sell Disney secrets that Hoxie learned at her job to some 30 hedge funds and other investors. Prosecutors said he used a FedEx Kinko\\'s computer for the deed. Bad idea. Google found the computer, and several funds went to the authorities. Both defendants admitted their guilt. Sebbag was sentenced to 27 months in prison. Hoxie got probation. CANADA TOO Two years ago, Canadian prosecutors said lawyer Gil Cornblum and his friend Stanko Grmovsek relied on pay phones for several years as part of a 14-year insider trading conspiracy based on secrets Cornblum learned at his job. Cornblum committed suicide by jumping from a Toronto bridge in October 2009, a day before Grmovsek pleaded guilty. Prosecutors say Rajaratnam, a one-time billionaire, also tried to cover his tracks. Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty. He is set to begin his defense next week in Manhattan federal court, in Wall Street\\'s bigger insider trading case since the prosecutions of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken more than two decades ago. Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey & Co consultant arrested with Rajaratnam and now cooperating with the government, last month testified to having lolled with his longtime friend in a pair of deck chairs in Miami Beach, just prior to their arrests. \"You know, Anil, I\\'m told there\\'s a gentleman who used to work for me and he\\'s now wearing a wire,\" Kumar recalled Rajaratnam as saying. \"You should be careful,\" Kumar said he responded. \"You should make prepaid phone calls to me.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by John Wallace)', 'date': ' Fri Apr 8, 2011 5:34pm EDT\\n', 'title': ' Insider trading handbook, Rule 1: Keep it quiet\\n', 'author': ' By Jonathan Stempel\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/us-insidertrading-idUSTRE7377MA20110408\\n\\n \\n\\n NEW YORK  ('}\n"

      "{'text': ' Investors looking for loan growth and surging revenues at the biggest U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) are likely to be disappointed by first-quarter earnings. \\n\\n Banks have been generating most of their profits in recent quarters from dipping into money they previously set aside to cover bad loans. Those reserve reductions make sense if credit losses are stabilizing, which seems to be the case. But banks cannot reduce their loan loss reserves forever and at this point profit growth must come from making more money from loans and generating more fees, analysts said. Boosting interest income from loans is tough when the interest rates at which banks lend are so low and loan demand is still tepid. Fee income, meanwhile, is being threatened by future regulatory changes. \"The revenue line will be key, that\\'s what most investors will be focusing on,\" said Jason Ware, senior equities analyst at Albion Financial Group. The Salt Lake City-based wealth manager oversees $650 million in client assets. \"The question everyone has is \\'Where does the top line go from here?\\'\" he said. Some banks will be particularly hard hit by weak trading in the quarter, as the stock market sagged on Middle Eastern political upheaval, a Japanese earthquake and tsunami sent the yen to record highs and markets were broadly unpredictable. But what many analysts are focusing on now is loan growth and data show the results may not be great. Bank loans outstanding declined 0.9 percent in January and 6.8 percent in February, according to a report from the Federal Reserve. Commercial and industrial loans were on the rise, which many analysts see as a positive sign, but meanwhile a broad array of consumer loans -- mortgages, credit cards -- are posting declines, so total bank credit outstanding are shrinking. The first quarter, analysts said, is typically the weakest of the year for banks. But the analysts with the best track records foresee a quarter that was tougher than usual for many banks, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine Smart Estimates. These \"smart analysts\" believe other analysts are far too optimistic about some banks, and only a little too pessimistic about the others. The analysts that have historically been the most accurate believe that results for Citigroup, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) will fall short of analysts\\' average estimates, according to Starmine Smart Estimates. Starmine\\'s analyst estimates, for example, indicates Morgan Stanley may miss estimates by as much as 22 percent. The Starmine \"smart analysts\" are projecting that Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) will beat broader estimates by a fairly small margin. BofA is projected with the largest earnings beat at 7.7 percent above the average estimate, Starmine estimates. NEW NORMAL For even the largest U.S. banks, interest income from loans is a key driver of earnings growth, but the total number of outstanding loans continues to stagnate, even as banks appear to have solved many of the credit issues that have dogged them for the last three years. The fees that banks get from processing debit cards will likely be limited by provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, which will pressure fee income for banks in the future. Marty Mosby, bank analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said he is expecting banks will show a 10 percent decline in total charge-offs of bad loans, with some showing charge-offs shrinking by as much as 50 percent. While that will be a boost to earnings as banks continue to release reserves protecting against loan losses, Mosby said he does not expect loan growth for the next few quarters. \"This will be a different model than what we\\'re used to seeing, based more on profitability, consolidation and efficiency, rather than outright organic growth,\" Mosby said. In the fourth quarter of 2010, loans at U.S. banks totaled $7.38 trillion, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2009 and off from the peak of $8 trillion in the second quarter of 2008, FDIC data show. Long term, investors may need to adjust their expectations for the industry\\'s earning ability. Mosby said banks that were once able to produce a 20 percent return on shareholder equity may not be able to top 15 percent. Bank\\'s return on equity could dip to as low or 10 or 12 percent, he added. Halle Benett, a banker in charge of financial institutions merger advisory at UBS for the Americas, said: \"I do think you\\'ve got to come to a decision as to what is generally accepted profitability for banking institutions and I\\'m not sure the cycle we came out of was the long-term norm.\" (Reporting by Joe Rauch; Additional reporting by  Clare Baldwin  and Lauren LaCapra in New York; Editing by  Gary Hill )', 'date': ' Fri Apr 8, 2011 7:14pm EDT\\n', 'title': ' Banks to post profits, but loan growth elusive\\n', 'author': ' By Joe Rauch\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/us-banks-earnings-idUSTRE73787P20110408\\n\\n \\n\\n CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  ('}\n",

Deepening violence in Libya and concerns about unrest in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria lent new impetus to a rally that is threatening to crimp global growth and add to growing inflation concerns. Analysts said Friday\\'s sharp gains in oil, wheat, copper and gold -- while stocks slipped -- stemmed from a big wave of second-quarter investment. Oil drew extra support from fears that the war in Libya was starting to inflict lasting damage on the oil sector. \"Troubles in Libya mean Gaddafi has caused damage to the Sirte basin, which has about two-thirds of their oil. There\\'s dollar weakness and some very large fund action piling into the market in oil and base metals,\" said Rob Montefusco, an oil trader at Sucden Financial. ICE Brent crude for May rose $3.98 to settle at $126.65 a barrel, highest settlement since July 2008. It reached $126.91 in post-settlement trading. U.S. crude rose $2.49 to settle at $112.79. It reached $113.20 post-settlement, the highest intraday price since September 2008. DOLLAR WEAKENS The dollar index .DXY measuring the greenback against a basket of currencies weakened as the euro jumped to a 15-month peak against the dollar following the European Central Bank\\'s interest rate hike. <USD/> A weaker dollar often lifts dollar-denominated commodities because they become attractive as a hard-asset inflation hedge and demand can be stoked by cheaper prices for consumers using other currencies. \"New investment flows at the start of the quarter are driving oil and gold this morning, with the strong rise over the past week attracting trend followers and more fund money,\" said Michael Guido, director of hedge fund energy sales at Macquarie Bank in New York. \"The uptrend is still very much intact, with key technical levels being taken out.\" Brent\\'s 14-day Relative Strength Index, a technicians\\' measure to gauge whether a contract is overbought or oversold, approached 80 -- a level only hit three times before and never surpassed, according to Reuters data. U.S. crude trading volumes above 600,000 lots neared the 30-day average, rebounding from late March when activity hit the lowest this year. AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST TURMOIL In addition to the Libyan conflict, investors eyed protests in top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and unrest in Syria, Yemen and attacks intended to interfere with elections in OPEC-member Nigeria, which produces 1.9 million barrels per day of oil. Libya\\'s civil war has cut the normal output of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) by 80 percent to between 250,000 and 300,000 bpd, according to a senior government official. NATO leaders have acknowledged the limits of their air power, with analysts predicting a drawn-out conflict.

Currently, companies can issue shares privately without incurring onerous reporting obligations if they have fewer than 500 shareholders.

UPS, which delivered more than one billion packages worldwide during the quarter, also reconfirmed its profit view for the year. Shipment volume and forecasts at UPS, along with rival FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ), are closely watched by Wall Street and considered an indication of overall economic health because of the vast amount of goods they transport. For this year's holiday season, UPS said it expects peak season daily volume to increase by 8 percent, with pick-up volumes for Cyber Monday increasing 10 percent. Earlier in the week, rival FedEx forecast an 11 percent rise for the same day, the Monday after Thanksgiving that is traditionally a big day for online holiday sales. For the third quarter, UPS said daily ground shipping volumes rose 3 percent, while next-day shipping fell 3.3 percent. Clients have been trading down from pricey next-day air deliveries to more affordable shipping ways that take more time, to save money. Also, manufacturers and retailers have become more savvy with their supply chains, planning shipments strategically to cut back on express shipping. This reduces costs for manufacturers, but hurts courier companies like UPS, which make more money on faster shipping. UPS said some shippers have moved their distribution facilities closer to their customers, which slowed air shipment growth but led to a greater use of UPS Ground facilities. For the third quarter, the Atlanta-based company earned $1.10 billion, or $1.16 a share, compared with $469 million or 48 cents a share a year earlier. The company expects earnings of between $4.65 and $4.85 per share for the current year. Revenue came in at $13.52 billion, up 3.4 percent over last year, mainly helped by U.S. e-commerce shipments and strong European export growth.

Jurors were scheduled to resume deliberating on Friday on whether to award punitive damages against Toyota. Before the jury could reach a decision, Toyota and lawyers for the plaintiffs announced they had reached a confidential settlement to resolve the case. The lawsuit is one of the first involving acceleration issues to go to trial since similar concerns prompted Toyota to begin in 2009 to recall millions of vehicles. The lawsuit alleged that software defects in the electronic throttle control system of Bookout\\'s 2005 Camry caused it to speed out of control and crash, killing Schwarz. \"While we strongly disagree with the verdict, we are satisfied that the parties reached a mutually acceptable agreement to settle this case,\" Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said in a statement. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, J. Cole Portis, said they were pleased with the jury\\'s decision. \"We are fully convinced that Toyota\\'s conduct from the time the electronic throttle control system was designed has been shameful,\" Portis said in a statement. \"We appreciate that the jury had the courage to let Toyota and the public know that Toyota was reckless.\" The case is the first loss for Toyota in a string of early trials over acceleration issues, which prompted hundreds of lawsuits across the country in the wake of the recalls. The 2005 Camry at issue in the Oklahoma trial was not included in the recalls. Two earlier trials in Brooklyn, New York, and California, absolved Toyota of liability for alleged acceleration-related defects. There have been roughly 200 proposed class actions and more than 500 individual cases filed against Toyota since February 2009 over the alleged acceleration issues, according to a regulatory filing from the company. Toyota has already agreed to pay a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve claims for economic losses, such as repair costs or lowered resale value, over acceleration issues. That settlement did not cover personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits. (The story was corrected to make it clear in paragraph 3 that settlement resolves entire case.)

      "{'text': ' Seeking to avoid a repeat of Facebook Inc\\'s much-maligned public debut, Twitter Inc revealed more modest ambitions, saying its initial offering would raise up to $1.6 billion and value the company at up to about $11 billion. \\n The valuation was more conservative than the $15 billion some analysts had expected for the social media phenomenon, potentially attracting investors who might consider the money-losing company\\'s listing price a better deal, with room to rise. Twitter had signaled for weeks it would price its IPO modestly to avoid the sort of stock plummet that spoiled Facebook\\'s coming-out party. It said on Thursday it intends to sell 70 million shares between $17 and $20 apiece, raking in up to $1.4 billion for the company. If underwriters choose to sell an additional allotment of 10.5 million shares, the offer could raise as much as $1.6 billion. Twitter\\'s offering will be the most high-profile Internet IPO since Facebook\\'s May 2012 debut, when the social network giant\\'s shares fell below their offering price and did not recover until a year later. Still, the modest pricing doesn\\'t obscure questions about Twitter\\'s profitability. \"The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop,\" said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Weath Management. \"But in the end, even for $11 billion, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it\\'s unclear that they\\'re going to be able to do that.\" At a roughly $11 billion valuation, Twitter would be worth more than Yelp Inc and AOL Inc combined, but only a fraction of tech giants like Google Inc and Apple Inc, worth $342 billion and $483 billion respectively. Facebook\\'s market value is now $128 billion. ROADSHOW RECKONING Twitter and its underwriters begin a two-week road show to woo investors next Monday in New York, with stops in Boston and the mid-Atlantic region before touching down in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Denver, according to a source familiar with the offering. \"They\\'re trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market,\" said Pivotal Research Group\\'s Brian Wieser, who valued the company at $19 billion. The company could choose to raise the price of the offering during that period as it gauges interest. Twitter is expected to set a final price on November 6, according to a document reviewed by Reuters, suggesting that the stock could begin trading as early as November 7. Sam Hamadeh of PrivCo, a private company research firm, said Twitter could raise the price range and also the amount of shares being sold. But, he added: \"Raising both the price and the size was Facebook\\'s fatal mistake.\" Twitter\\'s debut will cap seven years of explosive growth for an online messaging service that counts heads of state and major celebrities among its 230 million active users - but still operates at a loss. Twitter will sell roughly 13 percent of the company in the IPO and will have 544,696,816 shares outstanding after the offering. That figure could rise given the exercising of options, restricted stock units and the issuance of shares for compensation after the IPO. The company plans to list its stock under the \"TWTR\" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. Among the biggest Twitter shareholders selling in the offering is Rizvi Traverse, a fund managed by secretive Connecticut-based investor Suhail Rizvi, who has quietly amassed a 17.9 percent stake in Twitter with the help of Silicon Valley investor Chris Sacca. Rizvi\\'s stake will fall to 15.6 percent of total shares outstanding after the sale. JP Morgan Chase, which obtained Twitter shares through Rizvi and Sacca, will see its stake fall to 9 percent from 10.3 percent. Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, the largest individual shareholder, will reduce his stake to 10.4 percent from 12 percent, while Chief Executive Dick Costolo will emerge with a 1.4 percent stake, compared with 1.6 percent currently. Co-founder Jack Dorsey will also sell shares, as will early venture capital investors Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures and Benchmark Capital. FRACTURED OWNERSHIP Because many early shareholders, including Williams, previously sold parts of their stake to other investors like Rizvi, Twitter\\'s relatively fractured ownership structure looks markedly different from the likes of Facebook and other tech companies dominated by their founders. When Facebook went public last year, founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg kept 57 percent of the company\\'s voting shares, thanks to a scheme that gave him twice the voting power of ordinary shareholders. Following Twitter\\'s IPO, Costolo will be under pressure to improve its money-making ability. The eight-year-old company more than doubled its third-quarter revenue to $168.6 million, but net losses widened to $64.6 million in the September quarter, it disclosed in a filing earlier this month. This month, Twitter secured a $1 billion credit line from its underwriters including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. In recent months the company has aggressively introduced a number of new advertising products, including packages with broadcasters CBS and ESPN that show ads on TV and Twitter simultaneously for the fall TV season. Twitter has also sought to deepen its relationships with news organizations, which provide much of the content shared on the network. The company said Thursday that it hired NBC News digital executive Vivian Schiller as the head of news.

      "{'text': ' Britain\\'s economy picked up more speed between July and September, growing at its fastest pace in more than three years and building on an unexpected turnaround that has buoyed the government. \\n Gross domestic product rose by 0.8 percent, faster than the 0.7 percent achieved in the April-June period, Britain\\'s Office for National Statistics said on Friday. The quarterly growth and the year-on-year rate of 1.5 percent were in line with forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll. The numbers also made Britain, until recently a laggard among the world\\'s rich countries, one of its fastest-growing economies with an annualized growth rate of over 3 percent. British government bond prices initially rose, reflecting expectations among some investors that quarterly growth might have been closer to 1 percent, but quickly fell back. The pound strengthened slightly against the dollar and the euro. Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said quarterly growth could have reached 0.9 percent but for weak gas and electricity output. That was possibly a reflection of Britain\\'s unusually hot summer this year. Samuel Tombs, an economist with Capital Economics, said Britain\\'s economy was unlikely to gather much more pace because of wages that are rising less than inflation, more government spending cuts and the dormant euro zone. \"But with employment growing, confidence returning and productivity still well below its potential, it seems unlikely that the recovery will fade significantly either,\" he said. Britain\\'s economy has staged a surprising recovery since early 2013 when it avoided falling back into recession. The turnaround has given a boost to Conservative finance minister George Osborne, who defied calls from the International Monetary Fund and the opposition Labor Party to bring forward spending in order to get the economy off the ropes. The government hailed the growth figures as proof that its tough approach to public spending was paying off. \"Many risks remain, but thanks to our economic plan, the recovery now has real momentum,\" a Treasury spokesman said. STILL SMALLER The growth between July and September meant the British economy expanded for three successive quarters for the first time since 2011. Nonetheless, unlike almost all other developed economies, which have fully recovered output lost during the financial crisis, Britain\\'s economy remains 2.5 percent smaller than its previous peak in early 2008. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney noted on Thursday that growth was coming from a low base, so Friday\\'s figures are unlikely to sway policy at the bank, which has suggested it will keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5 percent for three more years. Earnings are lagging inflation, raising questions about the sustainability of the recovery and giving ammunition to Labor to attack the government in the run-up to a general election due in 2015. Friday\\'s data showed Britain\\'s giant services sector, which accounts for nearly 80 percent of the economy, expanded by 0.7 percent from the second quarter and was now above its peak before the financial crisis hammered Britain. Growth in services was driven by the private sector, while government services lagged behind, a reflection of Osborne\\'s push to curb public spending. Manufacturing grew 0.9 percent, and construction, which has begun to recover after a sharp contraction caused by the crisis, expanded by 2.5 percent, the strongest in more than three years as house building picked up, the ONS said. Consumers, a key engine of Britain\\'s economy, are feeling increasingly upbeat, a separate survey showed on Friday. A consumer confidence index compiled by market researchers YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research hit its highest level this month since it was launched in April 2009. The survey showed that expectations of higher house prices were driving the increase in confidence; homeowners expected their properties to be worth 2 percent more in 12 months\\' time, almost double the expected gain in July\\'s survey. Critics of the government\\'s economic policies say its attempts to revive the housing market will not help bring about the long-hoped-for rebalancing of Britain\\'s economy towards more manufacturing and exports. The ONS\\'s preliminary estimates of GDP are among the first released in the European Union, and are based partly on estimated data. On average, they are revised by 0.1 percentage points up or down by the time a second revision is published two months later, but bigger moves are not uncommon.

While equity markets in Europe and Asia were weaker, Wall Street extended its recent climb, helped by gains in technology shares after strong results from Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) and Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ). Microsoft shares ended up 6 percent at $35.73 while Amazon.com added 9.4 percent to $363.39. The S&P 500 has gained about 23.4 percent so far this year, just shy of its 23.5 percent jump in 2009.

Japan\\'s Nikkei stock average suffered its biggest one-day loss in 2-1/2 months on Friday, hit by the yen\\'s strength against the dollar. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 61.07 points, or 0.39 percent, to 15,570.28, the S&P 500  .SPX  gained 7.71 points or 0.44 percent, to 1,759.78 and the Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  added 14.401 points or 0.37 percent, to 3,943.361. For the week, the Dow rose 1.1 percent, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq added 0.7 percent. European equities ended slightly lower on Friday, with Telecom Italia leading the telecoms sector down on concerns of a capital hike by the Italian company and Volvo hurting industrials after reporting a sharp drop in profits. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  closed 0.1 percent lower at 1,284.76, but for the week was up 0.6 percent for a third straight week of gains after hitting a five-year high on Tuesday. .EU In the currency market, the euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.3808, not far from an earlier peak of $1.3832, its highest since November 2011. Against the yen, the euro was up 0.2 percent at 134.48 yen. The dollar was flat against a basket of six major currencies at 79.178 .DXY, off a near nine-month low of 78.998. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose, with benchmark yields hovering near three-month lows, as investors shifted their focus to the Federal Reserve meeting next week, where it might signal it will stick to the current size of its bond-purchase stimulus. The bond market has traded in a tight range since Tuesday, when yields fell on data that showed employers hired fewer workers than expected in September, stoking fears the economy was slowing even before the government\\'s 16-day shutdown. The 10-year note yield was on track to fall for a second straight week, though it has struggled to decline much below the chart resistance of 2.50 percent. After a choppy week for commodities markets, Brent crude for December settled down 6 cents at $106.93 a barrel while U.S. crude oil ended up 74 cents at $97.85.

      "{'text': ' AbbVie Inc ( ABBV.N ) on Friday reported stronger-than-expected results for the third quarter, as booming sales of its Humira arthritis treatment and Synthroid thyroid replacement drug more than offset lower demand for other medicines. \\n Shares of the drugmaker, which was split off at the beginning of the year from Abbott Laboratories Inc ( ABT.N ), rose 2.4 percent. Humira, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn\\'s disease and other conditions, is the world\\'s top-selling prescription drug. Sales have risen steadily since it was introduced in 2002. The injectable drug\\'s global sales soared 19.1 percent to $2.77 billion in the quarter, outpacing 16 percent growth in the prior quarter. Humira accounted for almost 60 percent of total sales, illustrating AbbVie\\'s growing reliance on a product that will lose U.S. patent protection in late 2016. Many analysts, however, expect sales of Humira to keep growing after its patent expires because it may take many years for generic drugmakers to develop and win approvals for complex \"biosimilar\" forms of the biotech drug. In the meantime, AbbVie is hoping to develop and market lucrative new drugs, including oral treatments for hepatitis C that could be approved by early 2015 and a promising treatment called ABT-199 for various blood cancers. \"The AbbVie story is good as long as Humira grows, and it\\'s growing above expectations,\" said Barclays analyst Tony Butler, who said the quarterly sales topped his forecast by $100 million. Humira sales were helped by a 15 percent price increase in the United States over the past year, he added. Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger predicted Humira\\'s annual sales will jump another 30 percent, to $13 billion, by 2016. \"It should have peak sales similar to Lipitor,\" Risinger said, referring to Pfizer Inc\\'s ( PFE.N ) cholesterol fighter, which had been the world\\'s top-selling drug until it lost patent protection in late 2011. AbbVie said it had earned $964 million, or 60 cents per share, in the third quarter, compared with $1.59 billion, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. Excluding write-downs of intangible assets and other special charges, profit was 82 cents per share. That was 4 cents above the analysts\\' average estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, based in suburban Chicago, raised the low end of its 2013 earnings forecast to $3.11 per share from $3.07, while keeping the high end at $3.13. Sales rose 3.3 percent to $4.66 billion, beating Wall Street expectations of $4.52 billion. Synthroid sales jumped 23 percent to $161 million, while sales of Creon, a digestive enzymes drug, rose almost 10 percent to $101 million. But sales of TriCor and Trilipix, drugs used to lower blood fats called triglycerides, fell 88 percent to $39 million due to competition from cheaper generics. Sales of AndroGel, a topical testosterone gel, and of HIV treatment Kaletra, both fell 11 percent. Shares of AbbVie were up 2.4 percent at $49.09 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

      "{'text': ' Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) has agreed to sell its majority stake in Australia\\'s third-largest thermal coal mine to Glencore Xstrata and Japan\\'s Sumitomo Corporation for just over $1 billion, pushing ahead with plans to focus on larger, core operations. \\n Rio put its 50.1 percent stake in the Clermont mine in Queensland on the block earlier this year, but appetite had been considered by industry advisers to be weak, given a poor outlook for coal prices and high costs in Australia. The sale - for $1.015 billion in cash - will be a welcome boost for Rio\\'s plan to sell down unwanted assets, as the world\\'s third-largest miner pares debts of $22 billion, cuts costs and tries to meet shareholder demands for better returns. Rio said on Friday it had announced or completed almost $3 billion of divestments this year, but its larger planned sales - including a stake in Canada\\'s largest iron ore producer, Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) - have struggled. The miner has already scrapped the sale of its diamond unit and aluminum. \"It\\'s not a bad price (for Rio), the market will be reasonably pleased,\" said analyst Des Kilalea at RBC Capital Markets. \"But the one everyone is looking for is IOC.\" Glencore ( GLEN.L ), the largest trader of seaborne thermal coal and a leading thermal coal producer, has slashed costs in its coal unit as it cuts back following the takeover of miner Xstrata. But it has also said it can benefit from increased blending and trading opportunities - as well as from a rise in thermal coal prices that it says are at unsustainable lows. \"Glencore is contrarian, this is the sort of deal that they do - buying up assets that no one else appears to want,\" one senior industry source said. \"This is not huge money for them, and it is about controlling a bigger piece of production.\" The deal will be financed by debt for around half the purchase price, meaning Glencore and partner Sumitomo will put in only just over $250 million in cash each. Clermont, a large-scale open pit mine, is also relatively low cost, thanks to a low strip ratio - meaning less waste has to be removed to expose ore for mining - and the ability to sell 90 percent of coal without washing. COAL TALKS After this cash deal, Glencore and Sumitomo ( 8053.T ) will each own half of the stake through GS Coal Pty, meaning an economic interest of 25.05 percent each. Glencore will assume Rio\\'s role in managing the mine and marketing production. Glencore and Rio have separately been discussing a possible combination of their coal assets in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, to help cut costs and shore up margins with thermal coal prices holding close to four-year lows. But sources familiar with the matter have said those talks were progressing slowly. Glencore is the top thermal coal exporter in Australia, while Rio Tinto is the largest thermal coal producer in Australia\\'s Hunter Valley. Glencore said in a presentation last month that a third of seaborne power-station coal production is loss-making, hit by oversupply. It has said the situation is unsustainable, as demand from new generating capacity in Asia increases. Rio\\'s co-owners in the Clermont mine are Mitsubishi Corp ( 8058.T ), Japan\\'s Electric Power Development Co Ltd ( 9513.T ) and a consortium of Japanese power companies. Dutch trader Trafigura and India\\'s Adani Enterprises Ltd ( ADEL.NS ) had put in bids below $850 million for the Clermont stake, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Deutsche Bank advised Rio Tinto on the sale.

      "{'text': ' The chief executive of outsourcing firm Serco has quit as part of a major reorganisation aimed at rebuilding its reputation with its biggest customer, the British government, following a series of scandals. \\n The UK government, which accounts for about 25 percent of Serco\\'s revenue, said in July it would not award the firm or rival G4S any new contracts pending a review of existing ones, after an audit discovered they had charged for tagging criminals who were dead, in prison or not being monitored. The scandal has intensified the debate in Britain over the outsourcing of public services to profit-driven private firms - a key strategy to reduce government spending, but which has also led to a string of embarrassments, such as when G4S failed to supply enough security staff for the 2012 London Olympics. On Thursday, G4S said its UK chief executive had resigned and been replaced by the group\\'s chief operating officer. Serco, with over 120,000 staff in more than 30 countries, said on Friday Chris Hyman had resigned as chief executive. As part of a company-wide overhaul, Serco said it would strengthen its board by adding three new non-executive directors and would split its UK central government work into a separate unit, allowing it to devote more time to its top customer. \"We are taking all of the actions which we believe are appropriate in order to restore that confidence of government,\" Chairman Alastair Lyons told Reuters. \"I have a high level of confidence that it\\'s repairable.\" Lyons added that Serco had already commissioned a search to find a new CEO, whom he said would come from outside the firm. The news was taken well by investors, with Serco shares up 1 percent around 1520 GMT. It was also welcomed by the government which described it as a \"positive move\". WIDER SCRUTINY Serco shares had lost more than 10 percent in value, or 320 million pounds ($517 million), since the government first said it had concerns over the tagging contract. In August, the company\\'s problems increased when the British justice ministry asked police to investigate alleged fraudulent behavior by some Serco staff working on a prisoner escorting contract. The scandals came to light as the government centralized more procurement and placed suppliers under increased scrutiny. Prior to 2010, firms like Serco had enjoyed double-digit percentage rises in revenue for two decades. Four of the government\\'s biggest suppliers - G4S, Serco as well as rivals Capita and Atos - have been called to appear before a committee of British lawmakers next month for questioning about the outsourcing sector. Analysts at Jefferies said Serco\\'s move to split its UK & Europe division would allow greater transparency around profits from its contracts - a key government priority. Serco, which makes annual revenue of around 4.9 billion pounds, has continued to win deals in its other markets, such as a 335 million pound tie-up to run Dubai\\'s metro system, though it has encountered some problems abroad. It is due to appear in the U.S. House of Representatives to explain its part in the troubled rollout of the \"Obamacare\" healthcare laws, though it is not accused of any wrongdoing. Ed Casey, who has led Serco\\'s Americas division since 2005, will take over as acting CEO while the group looks for a full-time replacement. \"He has not been involved with the UK business up to now so whilst he understands all the issues from being part of the executive committee, he is able to actually come to this with a completely fresh relationship with government,\" Lyons said. Serco is now awaiting the results of three UK reviews: one concerning details of its tagging contract, a Cabinet Office investigation into all its biggest government deals, and an assessment led by government non-executive directors into whether it has taken appropriate steps to address shortcomings. All three are expected to report before the end of the year. On top of those, the UK government has also asked the Serious Fraud Office to consider carrying out an investigation into G4S and then later Serco. Serco has agreed to repay all past profits on the prisoner escorting contract and forgo any future profits and will repay any amount due on the electronic tagging contract.

Heinz Co, since that company is now led by Bernardo Hees, the former chief executive of hamburger rival Burger King Worldwide Inc ( BKW.N ). \"As a result of recent management changes at Heinz, we have decided to transition our business to other suppliers over time,\" McDonald\\'s said in a statement. \"We have spoken to Heinz and plan to work together to ensure a smooth and orderly transition,\" said McDonald\\'s, which has more than 34,000 restaurants around the globe. Heinz declined to comment. \"As a matter of policy, Heinz does not comment on relationships with customers,\" company spokesman Michael Mullen said. The switch will be more apparent overseas than in the United States, as McDonald\\'s only serves Heinz ketchup in two domestic markets - Pittsburgh and Minneapolis, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported on Friday. Indeed, ketchup packages handed out at McDonald\\'s restaurants in the United States often say only \"fancy ketchup.\" Most in-store ketchup dispensers are not branded. The move from McDonald\\'s could benefit Heinz ketchup rivals Hunt\\'s, owned by ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ), and Del Monte.

Burger King has been a Heinz customer for \"decades\" and uses its products in roughly 80 percent of markets around the world, spokesman Miguel Piedra told Reuters.

      "{'text': ' China\\'s top legal body has strengthened consumer rights in the country after it revised the nation\\'s Consumer Protection Law on Friday, the first major overhaul in two decades. \\n The revisions increase consumer powers, add rules for the booming Internet shopping sector and stiffen punishments for businesses that mislead shoppers. Chinese regulators have been cracking down on real or perceived corporate wrongdoing, with domestic and international infant formula makers and drugmakers particularly coming under the spotlight this year. Global firms like Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) have also been getting caught in the glare, while South Korea\\'s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), the world\\'s largest smartphone maker, had to apologize to Chinese customers on Thursday after a broadcast on China Central Television criticized company repair policies. China is also trying to stimulate domestic consumer spending as it attempts to transition from an investment-led economy to a more consumption-driven model. But domestic consumers are often wary of product safety and quality, with 3.8 billion yuan ($624.79 million) worth of poor quality goods sold in China between 2010 and 2012, according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). \"Strengthening consumer confidence will benefit the whole nation\\'s economic development and boost domestic demand,\" Jia Dongming, director of the civil law working committee under China\\'s Standing Committee, said at a press briefing to announce the changes to the law. The amendments to the 1993 law include increasing compensation for consumers and raising fines for retailers who violate the law, including in cases where faulty products lead to consumers being harmed or killed. Compensation rose from equaling the amount of damages to three times the amount. China will also strengthen the role of the China Consumers\\' Association, which will be able to represent groups of consumers in any wider class actions against retailers. Officials also stressed the growing importance of protecting consumers in China\\'s booming online shopping sector, which has expanded rapidly with the rise of market leader Alibaba\\'s Taobao, Wal-Mart Stores Inc\\'s ( WMT.N ) Yihaodian and 360Buy.com. Internet sales have risen almost 50-fold since 2006 to hit 1.3 trillion yuan ($213.75 billion) in 2012, according to Jia, while analysts predict e-commerce will account for a fifth of total retail sales in China within five years. The law will make it easier for consumers to return goods bought online, while sellers will bear the burden of proof in any disputes. Online retailers will also have to meet strict privacy requirements, including requesting users\\' permission to use any personal data. \"The make-up and challenges of the consumer sector has completely changed and so the law has had to adapt for the times,\" said Jia.

      "{'text': ' Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) will team up to bid on a new U.S. Air Force long-range bomber program, a multibillion-dollar project that U.S. Air Force officials have described as a top acquisition priority. \\n Boeing, which has played a role in every U.S. bomber program since World War Two, would be the prime contractor on the next-generation bomber program, with Lockheed as its primary subcontractor, the companies said on Friday. The Air Force has said it plans to buy as many as 100 new bombers for no more than $550 million each. Air Force spokesman Ed Gulick said $581 million had been spent on the Long-Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) program to date, starting in fiscal 2012. \"The LRS-B is a top modernization priority for the Air Force and critical to our national security,\" he said. \"The Air Force looks forward to working with all participating industry partners on this very important program.\" Gulick had no immediate comment on the pact between Boeing and Lockheed. The Air Force estimate of $550 million a plane reflects only the procurement cost of the new weapons, but not the cost of developing the plane or construction of new hangars. In July, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel vowed to protect several weapons programs, including the new bomber program, if Congress failed to reverse mandatory budget cuts and the military opted to preserve high-end capabilities over size. Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ), maker of the B-2 stealth bomber, is also expected to compete to build the new long-range strike bomber, a program that\\'s expected to reap billions of dollars of revenue for the winning bidder. Northrop spokesman Randy Belote declined to comment on the Boeing-Lockheed teaming agreement but said his company viewed the bomber program as \"vital to both national security and the power projection capability of the U.S. Air Force.\" STIFF COMPETITION The teaming agreement brings together the Pentagon\\'s two largest suppliers: Lockheed, ranked No. 1, and Boeing, the second-largest, which some analysts said would present Northrop with stiff competition. \"A Boeing-Lockheed teaming arrangement leaves Northrop as the odd man out,\" said Virginia-based defense consultant Loren Thompson. \"It would be tough for Northrop to compete against a Boeing-Lockeed Martin bomber team, which would have greater resources and probably a greater ability to bid aggressively.\" Still, Brett Lambert, who retired as the Pentagon\\'s top industrial base official in August, told Reuters he did not think there was a favored bidder at the moment. \"The department is looking at this as an absolute necessity and they are absolutely committed to a competition. They haven\\'t penciled anyone in,\" he said. \"That\\'s the great thing about competition: it often surprises you.\" Lambert said it was a major accomplishment that the new bomber had survived recent budget cuts, given mounting pressure to cancel new programs. Top Pentagon leaders had made a concerted effort to continue funding initial design work on the bomber program to ensure that all three companies were able to maintain teams of design engineers, he said. \"The easy solution, given the budget environment would have been to terminate the program, but the department made a conscious decision to keep the design teams in place,\" he said. Lockheed and Boeing had teamed up in 2008 to develop a joint bid for the bomber, but parted ways two years later. Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates had put the program on hold in 2009 and asked the Air Force to find a more affordable approach. In a statement, Boeing said the team would benefit from nearly two centuries of combined experience in designing, developing and testing aircraft for militaries around the world. Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed\\'s aeronautics division, said the teaming agreement would help the companies \"affordably design, develop, produce and sustain\" a new bomber that met the Air Force\\'s budget and schedule requirements. Shares of Boeing, Lockheed and other major defense contractors traded higher Friday after a round of better-than-expected recent earnings in the sector. Lockheed shares were up more than 1 percent at $133.81 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Boeing shares were up 1.6 percent at $131.04. Northrop shares rose 0.8 percent to $108.34.

Thomson Reuters requested that a Manhattan federal court dismiss the claim on the basis that Rosenblum contacted the FBI and not the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides whistleblower protections. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan concluded, however, that a 2011 SEC rule did not require Rosenblum to make a report to that regulator to obtain whistleblower protection. Scheindlin also dismissed Rosenblum\\'s claim for punitive damages, saying the law did not authorize them. A spokesman for Thomson Reuters said the company is disappointed with the court\\'s decision. \"The company has policies in place to ensure that all terminations are handled fairly and in accordance with applicable law,\" said Thomson Reuters spokesman Lemuel Brewster. \"This decision is not a ruling on the merits of the case, and we look forward to presenting the facts relating to the plaintiff\\'s claims as this litigation unfolds.

      "{'text': ' Orders for a wide range of U.S.-made capital goods plummeted in September and consumer sentiment weakened sharply in October, signs that a budget battle in Washington has held back the economy. \\n New orders of non-military capital goods other than aircraft, an indicator of business spending plans, fell 1.1 percent last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That could be a sign businesses were shutting their wallets as the fiscal debate was heating up in Washington. A surge in volatile aircraft orders helped push overall orders of long-lasting factory goods to rise a more-than-expected 3.7 percent during the month. But orders for durable goods, which include everything from toasters to tanks, fell 0.1 percent when factoring out transportation equipment. The data suggests businesses may have scaled back investment plans as a political impasse in Washington threatened to lead the government to miss payments on its obligations, although firms also could be trimming these plans over more general doubts regarding the economy\\'s strength. \"We are looking at a situation where businesses were preparing for the chaos in Washington which actually happened,\" said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economics Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The government impasse was eventually resolved in October, though not before a partial government shutdown left hundreds of thousands of people out of work for weeks and also delayed the release of a slew of economic data. While the economy was already struggling before the government shutdown, economists estimate the shutdown will shave as much as 0.6 percentage point off annualized fourth-quarter gross domestic product through reduced government output and damage to both consumer and business confidence. And even before the impasse, the pace of hiring by U.S. employers had slowed sharply in September. Worries over the economic fallout helped push U.S. consumer sentiment in October to its lowest level since the end of last year, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\\'s final reading of consumer sentiment for the month. The survey\\'s index for consumer sentiment fell to 73.2 in October from 77.5 in September. It was the lowest final reading since December 2012. \"This could cast a dark cloud over the year-end holiday season in terms of consumer spending,\" said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. Separately, U.S. wholesale inventories rose more than expected in August, the Commerce Department said. The federal government shut down for 16 days in the first half of October as Congressional Republicans sought to undermine President Barack Obama\\'s signature health care law as a condition of funding the government. The government also came close to breaching its borrowing limit, which compounded the crisis and could have pushed the country closer to a historic debt default. Friday\\'s data bodes poorly for the outlook for GDP in the third quarter as well. Shipments of non-military capital goods other than aircraft fell 0.2 percent in September. These so-called \"core\" shipments, which the government uses directly for calculating total economic growth, have now fallen in two of three months in the third quarter. \"Most businesses are continuing to sit on their hands rather than aggressively invest and expand,\" said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. The data led Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto, to lower his forecast for third-quarter economic growth to a 1.8 percent rate from a 2 percent rate. Friday\\'s durable goods report was part of the catch-up effort in publishing a backlog of economic data due to the shutdown, and the data included revised readings for durable goods orders in August. Investors on Wall Street appeared to take little direction from the data. U.S. stock indexes opened higher on the back of strong results from companies such as Amazon and Microsoft.

      "{'text': ' Two U.S. law firms are in advanced merger discussions to create one of the 10 largest in the country, according to the firms\\' chairmen. \\n San Francisco-based Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe is expected to sign a letter of intent next week to join with Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a source with direct knowledge of the discussions said. Pillsbury Chairman James Rishwain and Orrick Chairman Mitch Zuklie issued a joint statement to Reuters on Friday that said: \"Our firms are in exploratory discussions about a possible combination. These talks are serving to confirm the great respect our firms have for each other.\" Orrick, with about 1,000 lawyers, is known for its intellectual property, litigation, emerging companies and corporate practices, while the 700-lawyer Pillsbury of New York has a well-known energy practice. Their joint revenue, based on figures reported by the legal trade publication American Lawyer for 2012, would place them at No. 9 in the United States. Orrick is known for representing clients such as Apple ( AAPL.O ), Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) and PG&E Corp ( PCG.N ), according to its website. Pillsbury has represented Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ), BNY Mellon BKBML.UL and Xerox ( XRX.N ) among others, according to legal experts and the firm\\'s website. Orrick has represented Oracle Corp ( ORCL.N ) in a patent lawsuit against Google ( GOOG.O ), over the Android mobile operating technology, and Microsoft in a patent lawsuit against Barnes & Noble ( BKS.N ) over its Nook electronic book reader. Meanwhile, Pillsbury has represented a number of companies and banks in mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings this year. There have been at least 58 mergers between U.S. law firms announced in 2013, a particularly active year, according to legal consultancy Altman Weil. In July merger activity in the first half of 2013 was its highest since 2008, it reported. The mergers have been driven both by the globalization of corporate clients that increasingly face complex national and international legal issues and by sluggish demand for legal services, leading firms to try and boost revenue by joining forces, legal experts said. At the same time, many large law firms in California have grown outside the state through mergers and acquisitions and by picking up partners as legal work has migrated to other parts of the country, according to legal experts. Over the years, they said, major financial institutions such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo have relocated their headquarters and offices outside of California, and as a result, many major law firms such as Paul Hastings, Latham & Watkins and Morrison & Foerster have seen their firms grow elsewhere. \"The California economy isn\\'t growing like it once was years ago,\" said Robert O\\'Brien, a partner at Arent Fox in Los Angeles who acknowledged that other major law firms have rejiggered their business models to remain competitive. \"Los Angeles has become very much middle market,\" said O\\'Brien. One source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity but was familiar with the latest merger, said that the discussions between the firms had been ongoing for months and that Orrick is expected to sign the letter of intent sometime next week. The deal could still fall apart, the source said. Both firms have been looking for partners for some time. The more profitable firm, Orrick, engaged in protracted merger discussions in 2006 with Dewey Ballantine, according to legal experts, but Dewey ended up merging with LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae to form the ill-fated Dewey & LeBoeuf later that year. Pillsbury has had discussions with a variety of firms such as the Washington law firm Dickstein Shapiro and the larger Fulbright & Jaworski, which ended up merging with the UK-based Norton Rose earlier this year.

If there are they could be considered,\" the pro-government Bugun newspaper quoted Erdogan as telling a reporter on his plane early on Thursday. \"Only if China pulls out of the negotiations will the possibility of talks with the other sides emerge.\" A senior Turkish official familiar with the matter confirmed Erdogan had made the comments. The U.S. ambassador to Turkey said on Thursday Washington was concerned that the $3.4 billion deal with the Chinese firm could undermine allied air defenses and had begun \"expert\" talks with Ankara to assess the potential impact. NATO has also said it is worried about Turkey buying a system not compatible with those of other member states, potentially undermining a core principle of the 28-nation alliance. Turkey announced in September it had chosen the FD-2000 missile defense system CPMIEC over rival systems from Franco/Italian Eurosam SAMP/T and U.S. firm Raytheon Co ( RTN.N ), though officials have since said the decision is not yet final. Both Turkey and China have said Ankara\\'s decision was made on purely commercial grounds. Turkey has said CPMIEC offered the most competitive terms and would enable production to be partly based in Turkey, helping it achieve its long-standing goal of strengthening its domestic defense industry. Raytheon said on Thursday it was still ready to sell its Patriot missile defense system to Turkey if Ankara changed its mind. CPMIEC is under U.S. sanctions for violations of the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act.

      "{'text': ' The head of Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ) looks set to survive the revelation of bank loans to mobsters, a move that could revive his recently flagging efforts to improve corporate governance at Japan\\'s second-largest bank by assets. \\n Mizuho will not sack Yasuhiro Sato as president and CEO, but may suspend his pay for some period, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The bank is expected to announce its response to the scandal on Monday. The uproar over the mob loans has sidetracked Sato over the past month from his quest to unify the fractious financial group, which lags Japan\\'s other two \"megabanks\" in key measures of financial performance. It comes as Mizuho is trying to expand its loan business globally and establish itself as \"Asia\\'s core bank\". But the mob loans reflect badly on Mizuho\\'s past governance more than on Sato\\'s reform drive, said banking analyst Toyoki Sameshima at BNP Paribas Securities. \"The matter gives all the more reason for Sato to push forward with fixing the bank\\'s problems,\" Sameshima said. \"I don\\'t think it will be a significant setback to Sato\\'s efforts to change the bank or his leadership.\" In the latest scandal involving a major Japanese company having ties with the underworld, regulators disclosed in late September that Mizuho had funneled some $2 million through an affiliated financing firm to organized crimes figures in 230 small transactions, mostly car loans. Mizuho initially said that knowledge of the loans went only as far as the bank\\'s compliance officers, but later the bank acknowledged that the transactions had been reported to top officials, including Sato, at board meetings. The Financial Services Agency late last month ordered Mizuho to improve its business practices after it failed to stop the mob lending more than two years after finding out about the loans. Working with an outside panel of lawyers, Mizuho aims to submit a report to the regulator on Monday. The scandal, in addition to highlighting the pervasive reach of \"yakuza\" crime syndicates and other underworld elements throughout Japan Inc, also epitomizes the lapses in corporate governance that Sato himself has been struggling to fix. \"Sato was getting a tighter grip on the bank and his leadership was getting traction,\" said a former Mizuho executive. But the scandal \"has pretty much undone it.\" Mizuho is particularly vulnerable to bad governance and compliance because 13 years after its formation, in a three-way merger of failing banks during Japan\\'s financial crisis, it remains three banks in one. \"ONE MIZUHO\" Sato has been viewed very favorably by investors as \"a symbol of One Mizuho\", the bank\\'s unification effort, said banking analyst Yoshinobu Yamada at Deutsche Securities. The 61-year-old banker has been trying to unify a financial giant that still maintains separate cultures and loyalties from its long-defunct constituent lenders: the Industrial Bank of Japan, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank. The tussling fiefdoms have fostered a culture of protecting turf and refraining from taking broad responsibility for problems, Mizuho bankers admit. Japanese mergers often leave legacy factions, but Mizuho is an extreme case because none of the three banks clearly dominated. Top Mizuho jobs have rotated among the three factions, with none stamping its imprint on the broader institution. That has contributed to the bank\\'s inability to generate profits and shareholder value commensurate with its enormous heft. Mizuho\\'s assets are 25 percent smaller than those of Japan\\'s biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( 8306.T ), but Mizuho\\'s market value is a full 44 percent lower and its net profits for the latest quarter were 34 percent lower than MUFG\\'s. Even more starkly, Mizuho is 16 percent bigger by assets than Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ( 8316.T ) but its market capitalization and profits are nearly 30 percent lower. Sato, an urbane banker with a wealth of international contacts, is a product of IBJ, originally a government-backed bank that helped finance Japan\\'s rise as an industrial power. IBJ bankers have famously considered themselves an economic and social elite, especially compared with their Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Fuji colleagues, who contributed a massive retail presence to Mizuho. Fighting to break the silo mentality, Sato at one point rejected a proposed line-up of senior management that favored ex-IBJ executives, said a Mizuho official familiar with the process. Sato also led July\\'s consolidation of Mizuho\\'s corporate and retail lending units, also meant to unify the Mizuho brand and expertise. \"NOT NOTICED\" After a ritual deep bow of contrition at a news conference earlier this month, Sato said he had been \"in a position to know\" about the mob loans, but had not noticed them. He said that at eight meetings of the Mizuho holding company and retail bank in 2011 and 2012, the loans were mentioned in attachment documents about \"the resolution of transactions with anti-social forces\" - a euphemism for the yakuza - at Mizuho-affiliated consumer-finance firm Orient Corp ( 8585.T ). \"We have no alternative but to say that the Mizuho group overall was lacking in awareness of the issues,\" Sato said. \"I deeply regret this.\" A former Mizuho director said meeting documents would regularly have a line on the bank\\'s handling of anti-social forces, which were treated as little more than a statistical box-ticking exercise. Sato is expected to keep his post in part because the FSA initially backed him to take the helm at Mizuho and they see no viable successor. \"He\\'s eloquent. He\\'s full of ideas,\" said a source at the regulator. \"The FSA pushed for Mr. Sato.\" A Mizuho spokesman said the bank had made no decision on how it would deal with the scandal. The bank in recent weeks has declined to make Sato or other top executives available for interview. Mizuho\\'s stock has fallen 8.5 percent since the lending scandal emerged, versus declines of just under 6 percent for MUFG and SMFG and 5 percent for the broader Tokyo market. \"Although Mizuho is underperforming its rival megabanks, market consensus is that there won\\'t be a further surprise to hit the bank if Sato is not sacked,\" said Fumio Matsumoto, a fund manager at T&D Asset Management, who had continued to hold Mizuho shares in his portfolio since the incident. \"What the stock market had feared was the possibility that Sato would resign.\" Sato will likely have his pay suspended for six months while more than 30 senior executives will also be punished, Japanese media reported on Friday. Takashi Tsukamoto is likely to step down as chairman of Mizuho Bank, the firm\\'s core banking unit, while remaining chairman of the holding company, sources told Reuters.

Nasdaq said the figure is lower in part because some claims did not qualify for compensation under its plan. The main reason for the lower figure, however, was because one firm opted to try to recover funds through arbitration. The announcement did not name the brokerage, which was UBS AG. UBS has pegged its losses from the glitch-ridden IPO at $350 million and was vocal in its decision to file an arbitration demand which claimed Nasdaq had violated a contract agreement. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet, however, blocked the bank\\'s arbitration proceeding over the summer on several grounds, including a determination that the bank\\'s claims did not fall within the scope of the arbitration provision in their services agreement. \"Nasdaq has demonstrated that the arbitration should be enjoined because it is likely to succeed on the merits and will suffer irreparable harm,\" Sweet wrote. \"Given the substantial federal issues posed by UBS claims, the threat of an arbitration panel issuing a decision that may conflict with the decision of a federal court in a parallel litigation also weighs strongly against permitting UBS to proceed with its arbitration proceeding,\" he added. Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for UBS, told Reuters on Friday that the bank has since appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She could not comment further, as the case is currently under seal. Facebook\\'s problematic debut on the Nasdaq exchange on May 18, 2012, resulted from a systems failure that prevented the timely delivery of order confirmations and left more than 30,000 Facebook orders stuck in Nasdaq\\'s system for more than two hours. Many brokerages were left in the dark wondering if their trades went through. Major market makers estimated they lost collectively up to $500 million in the IPO. Nasdaq devised a plan to compensate firms up to $62 million, and laid out the criteria for how firms can be eligible to file claims. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the compensation plan in March, and FINRA was put in charge of processing the claims for restitution. Several months after approving the plan, the SEC in May filed civil charges against Nasdaq, saying the exchange\\'s \"ill-fated decisions\" on the day of the Facebook IPO led to a series of regulatory violations. Nasdaq settled the charges and agreed to pay a $10 million fine. (Reporting by Sarah N. Lynch; Editing by Gerald E.

      "{'text': ' The Pentagon\\'s chief arms buyer wants details on how Lockheed Martin Corp and other companies will be held accountable for the quality and reliability of the F-35 fighter jet as he considers whether to approve an increase in the plane\\'s production, U.S. defense officials said on Friday. \\n Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, is asking the Pentagon office that runs the $392 billion F-35 program to map out how it will ensure the quality, reliability and maintainability of the new warplanes as production ramps up in coming years, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Kendall chaired a five-hour review of the Pentagon\\'s biggest arms program on Monday that showed progress in F-35 development, production and testing, and confirmed that Lockheed and its suppliers were technically ready to increase production. But Kendall and other Pentagon officials want to make sure that they have contractual language and other tools in hand to hold Lockheed and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, responsible if problems arise. \"The government wants to see how it can incentivize the contractors to do well, and what leverage it will have if they don\\'t,\" said one source familiar with the program. The Pentagon drive for more rigorous oversight could result in additional clauses in the next contracts for jets and engines. The contracts are being negotiated separately by Pratt and Lockheed with the government in coming months. Government plans call for Lockheed to increase F-35 production from around 36 planes this year to 45 in 2016 and ramping up to 110 planes a year by the end of the decade. The company expects to build about 200 jets a year when the program, the largest in Pentagon history, is in full production. Decisions on future production rates have been complicated by the lack of a federal government budget for the new fiscal year that began October 1 and uncertainty about additional cuts in Pentagon spending due to take effect under sequestration unless Congress agrees on other deficit-reducing measures. Production levels also depend on F-35 orders by other countries, such as South Korea, which is expected to announce plans as early as December to buy F-35 fighters. South Korea would be the eighth foreign country to make a firm commitment to buying the F-35, joining the Netherlands, Britain, Italy, Australia, Norway, Israel and Japan. ASSEMBLED IN TEXAS Lockheed is anxious to lock down the production plan so it can buy additional $5 million assembly stations for the Fort Worth, Texas, plant where the jets are built. Kendall\\'s office is expected to spell out its requirements for continued rigorous oversight of the F-35 program next week. Maureen Schumann, Kendall\\'s spokeswoman, declined comment on the expected acquisition decision memorandum, or ADM. The Pentagon restructured the F-35 program in 2010, adding $6 billion to its development effort and slowing down production to reduce the number of possible retrofits needed since the plane was being produced as it was still undergoing testing, an approach known as \"concurrency.\" The F-35 program has also been subjected to intense oversight in recent years, including a 2012 review by the Pentagon inspector general\\'s office of program quality that found over 800 issues on each jet built. Lockheed and the government say they have made significant progress since then. Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the program for the Defense Department, was sharply critical of the contractors when he first took over last year and later accused them of trying to \"squeeze every nickel\" out of the government. But in September he told an Air Force audience that while he wished the program was \"further along,\" relations with the contractors were improving. Lockheed spokesman Michael Rein said it would be inappropriate for the company to comment on a government meeting it did not attend. But he said the company was committed to continuing to improve the production and quality of the jets. \"We are fully committed to cost effectively driving costs out of the program while improving efficiencies to deliver the F-35\\'s capabilities to the warfighter, allowing the services to meet their (initial operational capability) dates,\" he said.

If Paul did move forward, it would force Yellen\\'s supporters to round up 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to confirm her. The White House was always expected to have to secure 60 votes for the nomination to clear procedural roadblocks, and Democrats have repeatedly expressed confidence in their ability to do so. The swearing-in of New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker next week will return the Senate effectively to a 55-45 Democratic majority, meaning that only five Republican votes would be needed to support Yellen. White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One that the paperwork for the nomination had been submitted to the Senate, paving the way for formal consideration. \"We look forward to the Senate confirming her swiftly and in a bipartisan fashion for this very important role,\" he said. A Senate Banking Committee aide separately said that some of her paperwork had been received from the White House and her hearing was expected to be scheduled for next month. The banking panel, on which Democrats have a four-vote advantage, needs to vet the nomination before it goes before the full Senate for a final vote. Although Yellen, currently the Fed\\'s vice chair, is expected to win confirmation, the process is likely to be contentious. Many Republicans have criticized the central bank\\'s aggressive easing of monetary policy as a dangerous courtship of inflation that also risks fueling asset bubbles.

      "{'text': ' When Bunge Ltd ( BG.N ) bought five sugar mills in Brazil\\'s Sao Paulo state four years ago for $1.5 billion, they were considered the crown jewels of a burgeoning biofuel industry. \\n Now, they may be little more than millstones, hard-to-sell assets at a time of crushed margins and weak prices. In the industry\\'s first major capitulation to depressed market conditions, Bunge\\'s new chief executive announced on Thursday he will explore options, including a sale, for the loss-making business. The news came as the firm blamed a $137 million quarterly net loss on its sugar operations, which were roiled by poor crop weather and low global prices. As one of the last big merchants to get into the sugar market, it seems logical they should be the first to bail out. While rivals like Cargill Inc CARG.UL and Louis Dreyfus Corp LOUDR.UL have been mainstays of the global sweetener trade for decades, grains-focused Bunge only entered in 2006, and began buying up mills in Brazil a year later. But Bunge is not alone: the costs of doing business in Brazil have rocketed while the country\\'s frenzy over biofuels has faded; weak prices and four straight years of oversupply have dented global margins, hurting even the most efficient mills. \"Mills are facing a difficult time. Bunge is one of the victims of this environment,\" said Bruno Lima, a senior risk management consultant at INTL FCStone in Brazil. More than 40 smaller mills in Brazil\\'s center-south have already been sold or shuttered in the past few years due to chronic operating losses and rising debts, removing 30 million tonnes (1 tonne = 1.102 metric tons) out of Brazil\\'s 690 million tonnes output. HESITANT BUYERS With little sign of a sustained improvement, Bunge\\'s peers may be hesitant to take a bigger bet on a years-long bear sugar market or Brazil\\'s struggling cane industry. \"There are no buyers right now, so you could see them simply shutter a mill,\" said the former director of Brazil\\'s milling industry association Unica, Eduardo Carvalho, who now heads his own consulting firm for the sector Expressao Consultoria. Bunge, one of the world\\'s biggest sugar traders, has not yet discussed a sale with any suitors, but it may look to offload individual mills separately, Carvalho said. That would follow Louis Dreyfus\\' local sugar and ethanol milling spinoff BioSev, which in December sold its Sao Carlos mill in Sao Paulo state for 200 million reais ($90 million) to rival milling group Sao Martinho. Another alternative if there are no takers for Bunge\\'s operations would be to wind down capacity. NEWCOMERS\\' HURDLES Selling the assets would mark an exit for Bunge from milling sugar cane just six years after buying its first mill in 2007. Analysts have estimated it has since plowed more than $2 billion into scooping up assets in Brazil\\'s interior of Sao Paulo state, some of the choicest cane growing area in the world. Bunge now operates eight mills which process cane into sugar and ethanol with capacity to produce 1.2 million tonnes of sugar, less than 1 percent of global output. It was not alone. Many foreign firms including oil major BP PLC ( BP.L ) and Singapore-listed Olam ( OLAM.SI ) bought up mills and farms in a bid to vertically integrate their businesses and bet that tight sugar supplies and a growing ethanol market would boost earnings. But market conditions have soured as costs have escalated and the Brazilian government has placed caps on domestic fuel prices, hurting returns on ethanol and leaving the industry \"rife with uncertainty\", said Cesar Maria Borges, director of sugar and ethanol analyst JOB Economia. \"Multinationals like Bunge are shy about uncertainties that rest on government involvement, as is the case with the price of fuels in Brazil,\" he said. Given the troubling outlook for ethanol and slim margins, it made sense for Bunge\\'s new Chief Executive Soren Schroder to cast a deeper look over the assets when he took over the reins in June. Weeks later, global prices hit three-year lows below 16 cents. To the surprise of many traders and producers, prices have since staged an impressive recovery, rising 18 percent since mid-July, as refiners bought at prices they considered a bargain. Even so, it was not enough to return Bunge\\'s sugar operations to profit. That may be a harbinger of more pain to come for the beleaguered industry. \"If prices don\\'t improve or if gasoline is not priced higher to help ethanol, the sector will stagnate or even decline,\" a U.S. trader warned.

But the unusually timed announcement, which appeared to catch other parties involved in the negotiations by surprise, covered not only $4 billion that was expected as part of the larger deal but also an additional $1.15 billion to cover separate issues over home loans. The $4 billion portion of the payment, which was agreed on several weeks ago according to people familiar with the negotiations, resolves a 2-year-old lawsuit in which the regulator accused JPMorgan of overstating the quality of loans in mortgage securities in sold to Fannie and Freddie. The agency became impatient waiting for the larger settlement and wanted to move on to resolving similar lawsuits it brought against other banks, one person said. The additional $1.1 million resolves claims that JPMorgan breached the representations it made about the quality of single-family mortgages it sold the government-sponsored entities, the regulator said. Negotiations on the final terms of the larger settlement are continuing, people familiar with discussions said on Friday. While the parties have agreed to the framework of the deal, talks have slowed over whether JPMorgan can shift onto the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp liabilities of Washington Mutual, a failed lender which JPMorgan took over during the financial crisis. The FHFA settlement leaves open the possibility for JPMorgan to recoup payments related to Washington Mutual. The Justice Department, which is leading the larger negotiations, is seeking a provision in the larger settlement that bars JPMorgan from seeking to push the claims onto FDIC, according to one of the people familiar with the talks. It is unclear if the FDIC will be part of the larger settlement. FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment. The $13 billion settlement is also expected to include a $2 billion enforcement penalty for JPMorgan\\'s mortgage securities sales which are being investigated by federal prosecutors in California; $4 billion of consumer debt relief; and $3 billion of assorted payments and compensation sought by other government agencies. \"This is a significant step as the government and J.P. Morgan Chase move to address outstanding mortgage-related issues,\" FHFA Acting Director Edward DeMarco said in a statement. The bank, the largest in the United States, said the deal was \"an important step towards a broader resolution\" of the firms mortgage-related issues with government agencies.

In prepared remarks for a speech to a securities conference in Atlanta, Georgia, Aguilar also reiterated his support for strict corporate penalties and the agency\\'s new policy of seeking admissions in some settlements, rather than letting defendants settle without admitting or denying the charges. Aguilar said he also wants the final version of the market disruption rule to do away with a \"safe harbor\" provision that would shield exchanges and their employees from liability as long as they have policies that are reasonably designed to comply with the rules. \"Such a vague and unprecedented carve-out would water down the rule,\" he said. \"The commission must adopt a strong and enforceable final rule that allows us to hold firms and individuals accountable when they fail to take adequate steps to comply with the rule.\" The SEC proposed in March the \"Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity,\" or Reg SCI.

The proposal targets exchanges, clearing agencies, certain large \"dark pool\" trading platforms and other self-regulatory organizations. It calls for these entities to report major systems disruptions and conduct testing on an industry-wide basis to ensure they have backup systems that are functioning properly. The SEC delayed adopting the plan and reopened the public comment period after exchanges including the Nasdaq and rival NYSE Euronext, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, called for a major reworking of the proposal over concerns about its costs and an \"unduly broad\" requirement to disseminate information to member firms about certain incidents. Since then, SEC Chair Mary Jo White has vowed to press ahead to finish the rule quickly in the wake of more recent technology glitches, including a three-hour halt on the Nasdaq earlier this summer due to a problem with the system that receives all traffic on quotes and orders. It is unclear how the final rule may shape up. While Aguilar has been vocally in favor of a tougher version of the rule, Michael Piwowar, a Republican SEC commissioner, issued a statement following the Nasdaq outage that urged the SEC to conduct more study \"before moving forward with further rulemakings.\" (Reporting by Sarah N.

      "{'text': ' The options market is reflecting a higher probability of large upside moves in Apple Inc and Facebook Inc stock when both companies report quarterly earnings next week. \\n Stock of Apple - the largest U.S. company by market value - is down 1 percent since January 1 while Facebook shares are up 95 percent. Many investors appear to be speculating on a rally rather than a sell-off in both stocks and are turning to the options market, buying calls at strike prices that are far above the current share price - also known as \"out-of-the-money.\" These are relatively more expensive than out-of-the-money puts. The situation is unusual, because investors are typically more concerned about downside risk and are willing to buy \"disaster puts\" - far out-of-the-money puts - at a higher relative price. This is because they do not want to lose a lot of money if the stock gets hit, said Steve Place, a founder of options analytics firm investingwithoptions.com in Austin, Texas. \"When we think about risk in the stock market, it\\'s normally about the downside,\" he said. \"People are scared about the downside risk.\" Call options are a contract that gives the right to buy a stock at a fixed price by a certain date, while a put gives investors the right to sell a stock at a preset price. \"Both (stocks) continue to have inverted skew, indicating options traders believe a sharp move higher is more likely than a sharp move lower,\" said Matt Franz, investment adviser representative at Stutland Volatility Group in Chicago. SMILE Normally, skew is an options metric that shows out-of-the-money calls being priced at lower levels of implied volatility than both at-the-money options and out-of-the-money puts. Implied volatility is a measure of perceived risk of future stock movement. The options of both Apple and Facebook are currently reflecting what traders call a \"smile,\" referring to a curve or skew on the implied volatility of strike prices when one looks at a chart. \"What we are seeing right now in these tech stocks is a \\'U\\' shape or a smile with both out-of-the-money puts and calls priced at higher levels of implied volatility than at-the-money strikes,\" said Jared Woodard, a principal at options research firm Condor Options in Forest, Virginia. In Facebook, the 10 percent out-of-the-money $57.50 strike calls expiring November 16 were priced at an implied volatility of 79 percent and cost $2.20 apiece as of Friday morning. The 10 percent out-of-the-money November $47 strike puts on Facebook were priced at 77 percent implied volatility at $1.68 as of Friday morning, according to Woodard. Facebook shares closed down 0.9 percent at $51.95 on Friday. In Apple, the 10 percent out-of-the-money November $585 strike calls were priced at about 38 percent implied volatility and cost $3.80 and the 10 percent out-of-the-money November $480 strike puts were priced at 36 percent implied volatility and are at $3.35 on Friday morning, Woodard said. Apple shares closed down 1.1 percent at $525.96 on the Nasdaq on Friday. Not everyone agrees that Apple\\'s options pricing reflects bigger upside risk for the shares. \"While I see the option market reflecting more upside potential for Facebook, I see elevated upside and downside risk for Apple shares in the options skew,\" said Ophir Gottlieb, managing director of options analytics firm Livevol. Apple is due to report quarterly results on Monday and Facebook will report on Wednesday. Over the past two years, the inverted skew was seen about 13 percent of the time in Apple, said Henry Schwartz, president of options analytics firm Trade Alert. For Facebook, this inverted skew has occurred 11.8 percent of the time, since the company became public in May 2012, Schwartz added. \"Demand for upside calls has outpaced that for puts, driving an inversion in the stocks\\' skew, which is fairly atypical,\" said Mandy Xu, Credit Suisse equity derivatives strategist. Jason Goepfert, president of SentimenTrader.com, says Apple is currently ranked 10th among 1,500 stocks he tracks in terms of optimistic sentiment. His data, which goes back about two years, is based on a combination of put-to-call ratios and open interest, short interest figures, analyst recommendations and recent price momentum.

      "{'text': \" Energy Future Holdings has stepped up talks with bondholders of its regulated unit, several people close to the talks said on Thursday, as it holds out hope of reaching the framework of a restructuring agreement before an expected bankruptcy. \\n The Texas utility is seeking support for a deal proposed by bank lenders at its unregulated holding company to restructure the bulk of its $40 billion in debt. Within the last few weeks, it has ramped up efforts to get first- and second-lien bondholders of Energy Future Intermediate Holdings (EFIH), its regulated holding company, behind the deal as well, the people close to the talks said. They declined to be named because talks are not public. The first-lien bondholders are being advised by lawyers from Ropes & Gray and financial advisers from Capstone, said the people. Pimco and Blackrock are among the largest holders of those bonds. The talks with the bondholders underscore the complexity of EFH's capital structure and its efforts to achieve a path for its restructuring before it files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company will likely file for bankruptcy, according to analysts and people familiar with the company's thinking, but would prefer to garner as much support from creditors as possible to facilitate a much easier and cheaper bankruptcy. Time to reach such a framework is running out: EFH has about $270 million in interest payments due next Friday, November 1, and while EFH could make the payment and extend the runway for restructuring talks, people close to the matter told Reuters it is more likely the company will file for bankruptcy protection ahead of the payment date. The company declined to comment for this story. BONDHOLDERS IN THE LOOP EFH, formerly TXU Corp, was taken private in 2007 in a $45 billion buyout, the largest-ever leveraged buyout. The deal saddled the company with debt just before a sharp decline in natural gas prices and energy markets. The buyout consortium included private equity firms KKR & Co LP ( KKR.N ), TPG Capital Management LP TPG.UL and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's ( GS.N ) private equity arm. The first- and second-lien bondholders at EFIH were initially not a critical part of restructuring discussions because they are considered in the money. But a restructuring plan put forth by the lenders, disclosed by the company in a Securities & Exchange filing last week, carries implications for their payments. While the economics of the plan could change, it purports to give the lenders all of the company's equity plus $8 billion in two tranches of debt, with the buyout sponsors receiving $800 million to be split with other creditor classes. The plan would forgo certain 'make-whole' payments that the EFIH first- and second-lien bondholders claim they are owed. Make-whole payments are generally triggered when creditors are repaid early to compensate them for the present value of foregone interest. The EFIH first-lien bondholders are negotiating in hopes of enforcing the payment if the bonds are refinanced, said two of the people close to the matter. The likelihood of getting a deal done remains uncertain, with sides still far apart on key issues, the people said. And, to be sure, EFH does not need any creditor support to file for bankruptcy, though having it would reduce the uncertainty of what would be a large and complex case. Ideally, the company would also like the support of other bondholders at EFIH. But holders of EFIH payment-in-kind notes already walked away from talks, and the second-lien bondholders are currently not restricted from trading, which limits the substance of any discussions they may have, according to two of the people close to the matter.

      "{'text': ' Greenland\\'s parliament voted on Thursday to end a decades-long prohibition on mining for radioactive materials like uranium, further opening up the country to investors from Australia to China eager to tap its vast mineral resources. \\n The move will not only allow the mining of uranium deposits, but also of rare earths, minerals used in 21st century products from wind turbines to hybrid cars and smart phones and that are currently mostly extracted by China. With sea ice thawing and new Arctic shipping routes opening, the former Cold War ally of the West has emerged from isolation and gained geopolitical attention from the likes of Beijing and Brussels thanks to its untapped mineral wealth. \"We cannot live with unemployment and cost of living increases while our economy is at a standstill. It is therefore necessary that we eliminate zero tolerance towards uranium now,\" Greenland Prime Minister Aleqa Hammond was quoted as saying by local newspaper Sermitsiaq during the debate. Hammond\\'s government won the heated debate by 15-14 votes. The possibility of uranium mining has been criticized by environmental groups. Earlier, a group of non-governmental organizations warned uranium mining in Greenland could threaten the Arctic region\\'s pristine ecological system. While Greenland is self governing, it is still a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. The former colonial ruler still has a say in security and defense issues and the uranium decision may need to be approved by the Danish parliament - possibly putting the two nations on a diplomatic collision course. \"Concrete actions on the mining and export of uranium will potentially have far-reaching implications for foreign, defense and security policies and are as such a matter for the Kingdom,\" Denmark\\'s Minister for Trade and European affairs said in a statement after the vote in Greenland\\'s parliament. Greenland\\'s \"zero tolerance\" policy on mining radioactive materials is inherited from Denmark, but the island is keen to develop mining to help pay for welfare and jobs in this country with a population of around 57,000 people, mostly Inuits. Since Greenland won self-government in 2009, most politicians have aimed for growing autonomy and eventual independence. The more revenues from mining or oil, the more Greenland weans itself off Denmark\\'s annual grant that accounts for more than half the island\\'s budget. One rare earth deposit being explored by Australian-owned Greenland Minerals and Energy ( GGG.AX ) could be one of the largest outside China, which accounts for more than 90 percent of global production. But still, mining production could be a long way off. \"I think the Danish government is prepared for the no-tolerance to be lifted\" said Cindy Vestergaard, senior researcher at Danish Institute for International Studies. \"After that the Greenlanders and the Danes are going to start hammering all the legal aspects. We will not be mining on Friday, nor next year, or 2015.\" Separately, iron ore producer London Mining said on Thursday it had received the go-ahead from the Greenland government for a 15 million tonne (1 tonne = 1.102 metric tons) a year mine in the country, paving the way to attract partners for the project. The Isua project which will cost an estimated $2.3 billion has been controversial in Greenland as fears its construction would attract a flood of Chinese workers into the country.

      "{'text': ' Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) is chugging along with its turnaround, posting a quarterly profit that met Wall Street\\'s expectations and holding to its annual forecasts as the world\\'s largest household products maker gets a lift from cost cuts and a lower tax rate. \\n Shares of P&G fell nearly 1 percent to $79.93 in morning trading on Friday. The maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent is trying to reinvigorate itself under Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley, who returned in late May to replace Bob McDonald. Lafley, who did not speak on the company\\'s conference call on Friday, has previously said the current fiscal 2014 would be a \"transition\" year, after the \"stepping stone\" year that ended in June. He has already split P&G into four businesses, hoping the new structure will boost efficiency. \"We continue to think the appointment of Lafley is more temporary in nature, until a permanent successor can be named,\" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. She said she was \"a bit perplexed\" by P&G\\'s decision to have Lafley participate only on certain calls and at major industry conferences as the company works to \"instill confidence and reignite its momentum.\" P&G said it still expected 5 percent to 7 percent growth in earnings per share this fiscal year, excluding restructuring charges. The company abandoned quarterly forecasts earlier this year. It still expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency changes, acquisitions and divestitures, to rise 3 percent to 4 percent this fiscal year. Regarding Lafley\\'s absence from the call, a P&G spokesman Paul Fox said: \"This change reflects our focus on annual results and trends rather than quarterly results and is consistent with our recent move to fiscal guidance.\" SHAMPOO SHOWDOWN P&G held or increased market share in businesses that represent about two-thirds of its sales during the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said. While he said he was \"reasonably happy\" with the results, he added: \"We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more reliably.\" P&G competes against a variety of companies, including Unilever Plc ( ULVR.L ) ( UNc.AS ). On Thursday, Unilever\\'s results suggested that its North American market share in the high-margin personal care business suffered because of promotions that P&G ran on its hair care products such as Pantene shampoo. However, Moeller refuted such assertions, saying that P&G\\'s hair care product promotions were down from a year earlier. The company\\'s market share in the category was flat. Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) also discussed a more promotional U.S. market when it released its results on Thursday. \"We see a different reality,\" Moeller told reporters. \"Promotion is important, and we will be competitive in our promotional activities, but it is not an area where we seek to lead.\" In North America overall, P&G\\'s share of the volume of goods that were sold on promotions was down 7 percent from a year earlier, Moeller said. P&G said it had earned $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter ended on September 30, up from $2.81 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. Core earnings per share, which exclude restructuring charges, fell 1 percent to $1.05 and met analysts\\' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2.2 percent to $21.21 billion, topping Wall Street\\'s forecast of $21.04 billion. Organic sales rose 4 percent. Such sales were up in every category except healthcare, where they were flat, due in part to a pet food recall. The beauty business was a disappointment, with organic sales growth of just 1 percent, analysts said. P&G blamed the sluggish growth on factors such as a decrease in skin care product sales. JPMorgan analyst John Faucher said he had expected 3 percent organic sales growth in the beauty division.

      "{'text': ' Japanese industrial output is expected to have rebounded in September, fuelled by strong domestic demand and business investment, a Reuters poll showed, highlighting the strength of the economy as government policies bolster growth. \\n Indicators of Labor demand, consumer spending and real estate investment next week are also likely to come in strong, showing that Japan is making steady progress towards beating deflation. \"Companies are going to start building up inventories to meet demand brought forward before the sales tax hike in April,\" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \"They will also produce more capital goods as capital expenditure plans are strong,\" he said. Industrial production is forecast to have risen 1.8 percent in September, according to the Reuters poll, following a 0.9 percent decline in August. The data is due at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday in Tokyo (1950 ET Tuesday). Manufacturers, surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, will also give forecasts for production in October and November, which will help measure how quickly output will grow as the year-end approaches. The jobs-to-applicants ratio, a measure of Labor demand, is expected to have risen to a five-year high of 0.96 in September from 0.95 in the previous month, the survey also showed. Growing demand for workers is a positive sign in Japan\\'s battle to end 15 years of deflation as this should push wages higher and spur consumption. Household spending in September likely rose 0.5 percent from a year earlier, recovering from a 1.6 percent slide in August, the poll showed. Retail sales are forecast to have risen 1.9 percent year-on-year in September, up for the second straight month in a sign of solid consumer sentiment. The employment, household spending and retail statistics are all scheduled for release on Tuesday morning in Tokyo. Japan\\'s property market has been another bright spot as people rush to buy homes and apartments before an increase in the sales tax in April to 8 percent from 5 percent. Data due at 2 p.m. (0100 ET) on Thursday is expected to show that housing starts jumped an annual 12.2 percent in September after a 12.0 percent rise in August. Japan\\'s economic growth has outpaced its Group of 7 rich-country peers so far this year as stock market gains stoked personal consumption, prompting some companies in the service sector to expand payrolls. There is also growing evidence that companies are more willing to raise wages and invest in factories and equipment, two steps that many government officials say are necessary for Japan to end deflation and shift its economy into a higher gear.

The DOT rule says U.S. airlines operating domestic flights cannot let an aircraft stay on a tarmac for more than three hours without letting passengers deplane. Exceptions are allowed only for safety and if the pilot is advised by air traffic control that returning to the terminal would disrupt airport operations. The DOT said the 13 tarmac delays exceeded the three-hour limit for the delays by two to 77 minutes for United and its United Express code-share affiliates. These delays were due to severe thunderstorms and lightning that caused several ramp closures and disrupted the movement of aircraft at O\\'Hare, the agency said. The government agency said the airline will pay the United States $475,000. The remaining $625,000 will cover mitigation measures for affected passengers, and significant corrective actions by United to enhance future compliance with tarmac delay rules. \"It is unacceptable for passengers to be stranded in planes on the tarmac for hours on end,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. United Continental ( UAL.N ), the parent of United Airlines, said it was \"committed to complying with the tarmac delay regulations and we continue to improve our procedures while maintaining the safety of our customers and co-workers.\" Although United had a contingency plan for tarmac delays, the airline did not implement the plan nor contact airport personnel or other airlines for assistance during the tarmac delays, the DOT said.

      "{'text': ' Soren Schroder is shaking up Bunge Ltd ( BG.N ) five months after taking the helm of the 195-year-old agricultural trading house. \\n After vowing in February that he would make no major strategy changes when he became chief executive, the company\\'s first new leader in 14 years has said that financial results must improve and chopped capital expenditure plans. On Thursday, Schroder told a quarterly earnings call that the status quo was unacceptable for Bunge\\'s loss-making Brazilian sugar milling business and that he will explore options, including a sale, for the business. Schroder, 52, also has ramped up discussions about share repurchases to the delight of investors who have watched as Bunge shares have failed to keep pace with those of rival Archer Daniels Midland Co ( ADM.N ). Bunge shares are up 13 percent so far this year, compared to gains of nearly 46 percent for ADM. Analysts say the changes are promising signs for Bunge, one of the world\\'s top oilseed processors and a major agricultural force in South America. Global grain companies need aggressive management amid intense competition to feed fast-developing countries like China, they said. Bunge has launched a \"strategic shift toward a focus on returns and returning capital to shareholders,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Ken Zaslow said on Friday. \"There are initial signs that new CEO Soren Schroder appears both more inclined and more capable of returning cash to shareholders,\" Zaslow said. Schroder, who studied economics at Connecticut College, took over from Alberto Weisser, 58, as CEO on June 1. Weisser transformed Bunge into one of the world\\'s largest agricultural trading houses from a regional operator over 14 years as CEO and will serve as executive chairman through the end of the year. Schroder\\'s annual base salary is $1 million, compared to $1.2 million for Weisser. Like Weisser, he is eligible for substantial bonuses. A former employee of rival Cargill, Schroder joined Bunge in 2000 and led the company\\'s North America operations for three years before becoming CEO. TEAM EFFORT Schroder, in an interview after Bunge reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday, said the company was making a team effort to improve results. Bunge reported revenue during the quarter slipped to $14.7 billion from $16.5 billion a year earlier, and came in below analysts\\' average forecast of $16.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \"The team is looking at the business very seriously, is committed to driving returns,\" Schroder told Reuters. \"We\\'re being very frank about what\\'s working and what\\'s not.\" Schroder cut capital expenditure plans for 2014 to $900 million after reducing plans for 2013 by 16 percent to $1 billion. He said the company would postpone projects, such as expanding oilseed processing in China, with the goal of \"buying time to grow into our own capacity.\" North America and Brazil remain two areas of focus for growth because acquisitions would be \"natural add-ons\" to Bunge\\'s food and ingredients business in the regions, Schroder said. In North America, Bunge is open to adding rice, wheat and corn mills, he said. Bunge on Wednesday said it struck a deal to buy Grupo Altex wheat mills in Mexico for an undisclosed amount. MAKING HIS MARK Bunge Chief Financial Officer Drew Burke told analysts on Thursday that share repurchasing was \"very much on our agenda,\" although no specific new program has been announced. Bunge initiated a $700 million program to buy back shares in 2010. The company expanded the program to $950 million in 2012 and extended its duration indefinitely. It has used about $450 million of the $950 million so far. \"There\\'s been a lot of talk about return of capital and probably more than the last several years combined,\" said Ari Gendason, managing principal for Arlon Group, a New York-based firm that invests in agricultural commodities and owns Bunge shares. Schroder \"has the benefit of knowing the culture and the people and the operations but also saying I\\'m going to put my own mark on this as CEO,\" Gendason said.

      "{'text': ' British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) breached a derivative agreement with a Black Diamond Capital Management unit and must return an estimated $297 million in collateral to the hedge fund, a divided New York state appeals court ruled on Thursday. \\n Barclays said on Friday it disagreed with the decision and was considering an appeal against it. The Connecticut-based fund\\'s BDC Finance LLC filed a lawsuit against Barclays in 2008, claiming it had defaulted on a $40 million collateral call made at the height of the financial crisis. Barclays disagreed with that amount, asserting it owed only $5 million, which it remitted to Black Diamond two days after the call was made. Black Diamond then declared Barclays in default. Last year, Justice Eileen Bransten in state Supreme Court in Manhattan dismissed a portion of Black Diamond\\'s breach of contract claim while allowing the rest of the lawsuit to proceed. However, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, a mid-level appeals court, reversed that ruling in a 3-2 decision on Thursday. The court found Barclays breached the contract both by not making the $5 million payment on time and by failing to follow the contract\\'s procedures for disputing a collateral call, which required the bank to pay the full $40 million amount before disputing it. \"The evidence in the record undeniably shows that Barclays failed to pay the undisputed amount by the deadline, and establishes as a matter of law that Barclays did not comply with the (contract\\'s) dispute resolution process,\" the three-judge majority wrote. With Barclays in default, Black Diamond had the right to terminate the agreement and demand a return of its entire collateral, which the fund has estimated at $297 million, the court said. Two judges, however, dissented from the court\\'s opinion, arguing that there were questions of fact over whether Barclays disputed the $40 million call in a timely fashion. \"We are disappointed with and disagree with the court\\'s decision. We are evaluating our options with respect to an appeal,\" a spokesman for Barclays said. An appeal would be to New York\\'s highest court, the Court of Appeals. Craig Newman, a lawyer for Black Diamond, declined to comment. Barclays Chief Executive Antony Jenkins is trying to repair the bank\\'s image after a string of scandals, but is being dogged by legacy issues as his bank remains embroiled in several legal disputes or regulatory investigations. It was the first bank to be fined for attempted manipulation of Libor interest rates, and Britain\\'s financial regulator and fraud office are investigating the circumstances around a controversial fundraising from Qatari investors in 2008. The bank is also fighting a $453 million fine imposed by U.S. energy regulator FERC in July, relating to power trading in the western United States from 2006 to 2008. The Black Diamond deal was signed in 2005. The total return swap transferred the benefits and risks of an investment in a Barclays-held portfolio of corporate debt instruments to Black Diamond in exchange for financing fees paid to the bank. The contract allowed each side to make collateral demands on the other based on changes to the value of the underlying loans. The case is BDC Finance v. Barclays Bank, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, No. 9906.

      "{'text': ' Sinopec Group wants to sell half of its two biggest shale gas fields in Canada to spread costs and accelerate their development as the Chinese energy company focuses increasingly on return of investment, an executive said. \\n The sale of an overseas asset would be a rare move for one of China\\'s state-owned energy companies, which have spent hundreds of billions of dollars investing in hydrocarbon resources from North America to Australia to secure China\\'s energy supply, often to hostile reaction. Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver told Reuters in Ottawa that Sinopec\\'s stance shows \"a state-owned enterprise that is acting like a commercial operation\": buying, selling or bringing in partners when appropriate. Sinopec would join a number of other companies seeking partners in the shale regions of Western Canada, in what has become a buyer\\'s market, albeit a popular one because the high-value shale gas is likely to soon find a ready market in Asia. \"We are not only buyers, but also actively seek joint-venture partners to optimize assets,\" said Feng Zhiqiang, newly appointed chairman of North America operations at Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp, Sinopec Group\\'s main acquisition vehicle. \"There is no such thing that a state-owned company\\'s job is only to obtain resources. Scale is important, profitable scale is more so,\" Feng told Reuters in an interview. Sinopec Group, the parent of top Asian refiner Sinopec Corp, is looking for an equal equity partner for Montney and Duvernay, two Western Canadian shale gas plays totaling some 500,000 acres (2,000 sq. km). They are operated by Daylight Energy, which Sinopec acquired in 2011 for more than $2 billion and later expanded. A sale could be viewed positively in Canada, where a landmark $15.1 billion acquisition of domestic company Nexen by state-owned Chinese oil firm CNOOC Ltd generated intense political debate and a policy backlash that centered in part on whether state-owned firms would follow market signals like normal commercial companies. Oliver, who visited China earlier this month, said he got no sense of a diminished interest in Canada\\'s resources. \"There was a lot interest and enthusiasm for our resources and investing in resource sectors in Canada at the very highest level in the government, right up to and including the president (Xi Jinping),\" Oliver said. \"The president commented (that) ...there is a real complementarity between our countries\\' strategic interests, particularly in the energy sector. We need to diversify our markets. It\\'s a strategic imperative. And they want to diversify their sources of supply and want to make investments in that context as well.\" STEPPING UP EXPANSION Feng declined to give a price tag for the stakes in the acreage but said their combined recoverable reserves were in the range of tens of trillions cubic feet. Thanks to successful exploration and a low purchase price, Sinopec has boosted the value of Montney \"many times over\", but the cost of the drilling to monetize the unconventional resource is too heavy for Sinopec to handle alone, said Feng. Sinopec wants to remain the operator. Sinopec, which supplies nearly half of the Chinese oil market, has so far spent $10 billion in Canada, around 14 percent of its total overseas investments. It pumps an oil equivalent of 3.5 million tonnes a year, or 70,000 barrels per day, from its two main acquisitions there -shale gas-focused Daylight Energy, and a 9.03 percent stake in heavy oil producer Syncrude. That is a fraction of the nearly 5 million barrels a day Sinopec buys on the international market for Chinese refineries. As a result of very high development costs and weak gas prices following the U.S. shale boom, Sinopec\\'s Syncrude operations have so far generated returns below expectations, and Daylight is still seeing negative cash flows, Feng said. Despite that, Sinopec wants to accelerate expansion over the next few years in Canada, potentially a major and stable supplier to China, which overtook the United States last month as the world\\'s top net oil importer. Canada holds the world\\'s third-largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Sinopec also hopes to be a sizeable gas player in Canada, building on the Daylight business and targeting annual capacity of 10 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas by around 2020 to help feed China\\'s rapidly growing demand for the cleaner fuel. \"There are few other pairs of countries like Canada and China that best complement each other,\" Feng said. But regulatory hurdles and lack of key infrastructure may hinder the growth of the Canadian energy sector, he said. The Canadian government has raised the bar for future acquisitions of its vast oil sands reserves by state-owned enterprises, limiting them to being minority stake holders. Sinopec also holds a 5 percent stake in Enbridge Inc\\'s planned $5.8 billion Northern Gateway pipeline, which would take oil sands crude from Edmonton, Alberta, to the Pacific Coast port of Kitimat, British Columbia. The line is awaiting a final decision from federal regulators, expected by yearend. But the provincial government of British Columbia is wary, and the project faces solid opposition from environmental groups and aboriginal communities. Changing market conditions have brought Sinopec many takeover targets, but it will be picky and aim for \"fair price\" deals, Feng said. \"Many companies are chasing us as a lot of oil sands and gas companies are in financial difficulties. But most of them still have very high expectations and believe that Chinese or Asian companies are ready to pay significant premiums,\" he said. Talisman Energy Inc, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, Athabasca Oil Corp and others are already looking partners for their holdings in the Montney and Duvernay shale gas regions. The two regions have become attractive to the oil industry despite low natural gas prices. Not only will the gas from the regions\\' fields find a ready market in Asia once planned LNG plants are completed on the British Columbia coast, but the regions also contain millions of barrels of high-value natural-gas liquids such as ethane and propane.

      "{'text': ' U.S. consumer sentiment dropped in October to its lowest level since the end of last year as consumers worried congressional dysfunction and the resulting partial shutdown of the federal government would hurt growth, a survey released on Friday showed. \\n The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\\'s final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment fell to 73.2 in October from 77.5 in September and was the lowest final reading since December 2012. The October figure was lower than both the 75.0 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and the mid-month preliminary reading of 75.2. \"Not too pretty but not a disaster after all,\" said Yelena Shulyatyeva, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York. Fiscal fights in Congress \"took their toll,\" with a drumbeat of negative news eroding sentiment. The federal government shut down for 16 days in the first half of October as Republicans in Congress sought to undermine President Barack Obama\\'s signature health care law as a condition of funding the government. The government also came close to breaching its borrowing limit, which compounded the crisis and could have pushed the country closer to a historic debt default. While a last-minute agreement averted that outcome by raising the debt ceiling until early next year, rating agency Fitch warned it could still cut the U.S. sovereign credit rating because of the political brinkmanship. \"When asked to describe in their own words what they had heard about recent economic developments, the number of consumers that negatively mentioned the federal government in October was the highest in the more than half-century history of the surveys,\" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. Other gauges also hit multi-month lows. The index of consumer expectations, at 62.5, hit its lowest since November 2011, and the index of current conditions, at 89.9, hit its lowest since April. The debt impasse likely affected economic growth in the quarter, with Standard & Poor\\'s estimating the shutdown took $24 billion out of the world\\'s biggest economy. The one-year inflation expectation fell to 3.0 percent from 3.3 percent while the five-to-10-year inflation outlook edged down to 2.8 percent from 3.0 percent. The sliding consumer confidence could in turn affect holiday spending - especially as the Congressional deal is only a temporary fix, which could see renewed fiscal debates toward year-end. \"I really hope the holiday season will be okay,\" Shulyatyeva said. \"This is really bad timing.\" (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and  Chizu Nomiyama )', 'date': ' Fri Oct 25, 2013 10:25am EDT\\n', 'title': ' U.S. consumer sentiment slides in October on government shutdown\\n', 'author': ' \\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/25/us-usa-economy-sentiment-idUSBRE99O0LU20131025\\n\\n \\n\\n NEW YORK  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Boeing Co ( BA.N ) has secured commitments for around 200 of its 737 Max aircraft, the upgraded variant of its best-selling short-haul planes, from multiple Chinese customers, said two sources familiar with the deals. \\n The deals are worth a combined $20.7 billion at list prices and must be approved by the Chinese government, a usual practice for aircraft orders in the country, before the customers can be identified, the sources said. These are the first commitments for the 737 Max from China, the world\\'s fastest-growing airline market. Officials from both Boeing and Airbus ( EAD.PA ), which makes the A320 that competes with the 737, have said China is likely to overtake the United States as the world\\'s largest market over the next 20 years. The commitments come from a range of customers including state-owned airlines via the national procurement agency, China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, as well as leasing firms associated with the country\\'s banks, the sources said. China Aviation Supplies could not be immediately reached for comment. Airlines such as Air China ( 601111.SS ), China Eastern Airlines ( 600115.SS ) and China Southern Airlines ( 600029.SS ) are all operators of the current models of the 737 in the country. Committing to the aircraft while waiting for the government to approve their fleet growth plans allow the airlines to secure some of the earlier delivery slots for the 737 Max, for which there have been 1,567 orders. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the deal, and would only say, \"discussions with customers are confidential.\" The 737 Max has been upgraded with new CFM Leap engines, and has several other enhancements that make it a more fuel-efficient aircraft than the existing models. CFM is a joint venture between GE Aviation ( GE.N ) and Snecma. Boeing said in a report in August that there are 1,650 single-aisle aircraft in China, with existing orders for another 700. These fly on domestic and regional routes of up to five hours. The planemaker also forecast that China will take delivery of 3,900 single-aisle aircraft over the next 20 years. The 737 Max competes with the Airbus A320 neo, the re-engined variant of the European planemaker\\'s popular single-aisle aircraft. Airbus said last month it has commitments for 100 A320 neo, including 60 from flag carrier Air China and 20 from leasing firm ICBC Leasing. China is also developing its own single-aisle narrow-body aircraft, the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) C919, to compete with the A320 and 737. The first flight has been delayed to 2015, with the deliveries not expected to begin until a few years after that.

      "{'text': \" Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) said on Thursday that it was cutting up to 4,000 mortgage jobs as fewer borrowers refinance, and fewer home loans go bad. \\n The layoffs are the latest round of job cuts at major banks as rising mortgage rates cut into demand for refinancing home loans. Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) have announced thousands of layoffs among them in recent months. At Bank of America, the third largest U.S. mortgage lender, about 1,200 employees were notified this week that they would be terminated. Most were full-time workers in the division that processes new mortgages, a spokesman said. Before the end of the year, the bank is looking to cut another 2,800 jobs in the division that collects payments from borrowers who are behind, a spokesperson added. Most of the layoffs in that division will affect contractors. Five years after the financial crisis, many of the loans that should never have been made have already gone bad, leaving banks with fewer troubled loans to manage. For Bank of America, mortgage loans that were delinquent by more than 60 days fell by 94,000 to 398,000 in the third quarter. The bank expects a further decline to below 375,000 by the end of 2013. Mortgage lending volume at Bank of America was down 11 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter. The number of applications the bank had received but not yet processed was down 60 percent in the end of September from the end of June. The bank expects to make fewer home loans in the fourth quarter and will look to cut more mortgage jobs, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said during an October 16 quarterly conference call with analysts. The job cuts at the bank follow another round of layoffs-- in the third quarter, the second-largest U.S. bank eliminated more than 9,000 full-time positions, or 3.6 percent of its total staff. Finance chief Bruce Thompson said on the October 16 call that the reductions were concentrated in the unit that collects payments on home loans, the unit that makes new home loans, and in many of the bank's branches. A majority of the latest cuts will affect employees based in California, Texas and Florida. News of the layoffs was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. HIGHER RATES SLOW REFINANCING Rising interest rates have weighed on mortgage refinancing at banks since the spring. The average interest rate on a prime 30-year mortgage stood at 4.39 percent in the week that ended Friday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), down from a high of 4.80 percent in September but above the 3.59 percent rate in early May. With rates having recently come down from their September highs, demand for refinancing has increased by one third, and overall mortgage applications are up by 18 percent, according to MBA data. But even with that pick-up, applications are down by 52 percent from their level in early May. With these declines, Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said on October 17 that it was cutting 925 mortgage jobs. That is in addition to the 5,300 Wells Fargo mortgage employees who were notified that they would be laid off in the third quarter. Bank of America was the third-largest U.S. mortgage lender in the first six months of 2013, making 5.2 percent of all U.S. home loans, following JPMorgan Chase, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication.

Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) gave the biggest boost to all three major indexes, while Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) also helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Microsoft shares jumped 6 percent at $35.73, a day after it reported profit and revenue above analysts\\' expectations. Amazon.com shares rose as high as $368.40, a record, after the online retailer reported stronger-than-expected sales growth. Shares ended up 9.4 percent at $363.39. The S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT rose 0.4 percent. The market has risen following last week\\'s legislation to avoid a U.S. debt default and end a partial government shutdown, as well as increased speculation the Federal Reserve will delay scaling back its stimulus for several months. The S&P 500 had hit record finishes for four sessions until Wednesday. \"It seems like good news is being responded to very well and bad news is just seen as more evidence the Fed won\\'t be able to tighten anytime soon,\" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The S&P 500 is up 23.4 percent so far this year, just shy of the 23.5 percent gain it posted in 2009. Surpassing the 2009 record would give the index its biggest annual gain in a decade. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 61.07 points, or 0.39 percent, at 15,570.28. The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index  .SPX  ended up 7.7 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,759.77, and hit an intraday record high of 1,759.82 late in the session. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 14.40 points, or 0.37 percent, at 3,943.36. Indexes also posted gains for the week. The Dow rose 1.1 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent and Nasdaq 0.7 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks .TOY registered its eighth week of gains, its longest streak since 2003. Based on results so far and estimates for companies still to report, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have risen just 3.4 percent in the third quarter, with 69 percent of companies reporting earnings above analysts\\' expectations. Revenue growth is seen at 2.2 percent for the quarter, with just 54.2 percent beating sales estimates, below the long-term average of 61 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed. Among other earnings, United Parcel Service\\'s ( UPS.N ) stock hit a record at $96.94 after the company posted a bigger quarterly profit and said it expects online sales to boost holiday volume. Shares ended up 1.2 percent at $95.61. Also, Zynga ( ZNGA.O ) late Thursday said it expects a full-year profit after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results. Shares jumped 5.5 percent to $3.729. Dow component DuPont ( DD.N ) jumped to the highest in more than 13 years, a day after announcing it will spin off its titanium dioxide unit within 18 months. Shares rose 0.8 percent to $61.90. The day\\'s economic data overall pointed to more signs that the recent budget battle in Washington has held back the economy. New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods outside of transportation equipment fell in September, possibly due to uncertainty over government spending. U.S. consumer sentiment dropped in October to its lowest level since the end of last year as consumers worried congressional dysfunction.

The Brazil plant has the capacity to produce up to 5 million tonnes of slab a year, part of which is sold to the Alabama mill for processing into flat products shipped mostly to carmakers. A new processing plant in Brazil could take up the output of slabs that ThyssenKrupp can no longer ship to its plant in Alabama if it finds a buyer for only the U.S. plant, the WSJ Deutschland said. ThyssenKrupp reiterated that it was in \"far advanced\" talks with one bidder over the sale of both Steel Americas plants and aimed to strike a deal soon. It is also in talks with other interested parties, it said, without providing details. ThyssenKrupp owns 73 percent of the plant in Brazil, called CSA, while the rest belongs to Brazil\\'s Vale ( VALE5.SA ). A source familiar with the situation told Reuters last month that ThyssenKrupp could give up trying to sell the plant in Brazil, having made no progress in sales negotiations with Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) ( CSNA3.SA ). A move to process CSA\\'s slabs in Brazil rather than in the United States may also have further financial implications as Brasilia passed a series of tax breaks in 2005 that benefited companies exporting at least 80 percent of their output.

      "{'text': ' The Federal Reserve meeting next week is not on the minds of as many people as when it met in September, but its decision to do nothing last month is providing the fuel for more share gains in Apple and Facebook, which report results next week. \\n Facebook is only slightly off an all-time high, and Apple has recovered somewhat from losses earlier in the year after investors have poured money back into stocks, bringing the S&P to successive records that some say may not be supported by corporate results. The numbers from Facebook ( FB.O ) and Apple ( AAPL.O ) are among those that will be closely watched - and investors say at their current levels, the margin for error is slim. Nearly half of the S&P 500 companies have reported their third-quarter results so far, and 69 percent have beaten Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. The technology sector has led the way, beating expectations 84 percent of the time. The most recent companies to do so were Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ), whose results led the S&P to close at an all-time high of 1,759.79 on Friday. Companies already stretched to high price-to-earnings multiples, like Facebook, will have to outpace expectations to keep investors buying. \"There is not a lot of room for error, especially with these names with a lot of momentum behind them. You have to beat the numbers pretty handily,\" said Daniel Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, who focuses on tech stocks. That\\'s where the Fed comes in. Some of the riskier names and high-dividend payers had pulled back in the late summer, anticipating the Fed would begin reducing monthly bond purchases beginning at its September meeting. But that didn\\'t happen - and since then, stocks have been unimpeded, save for the 16-day government shutdown that didn\\'t scare too many people. The Federal Reserve will hold its October meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. But earnings will overshadow the central bank, as it is expected to maintain its current policy, in part because of the economic hit that resulted from the shutdown. \"So far, this earnings season has been pretty balanced and on the positive side,\" said Paul Mangus, head of equity strategy and research for Wells Fargo Private Bank in Charlotte, N.C. \"If that continues into next week, and we\\'re not expecting anything surprising out of the Fed, it could continue to support markets on current levels.\" Mangus noted that expectations for the third quarter were low, so beating earnings estimates is not a particularly bold sign of strength. Many companies were able to create earnings without actual revenue growth, so 46 percent of results so far revealed lower-than-expected revenue growth. \"The sales numbers have been anemic. We\\'re pretty flat in terms of across the board revenue,\" Mangus said. For the past week, the Dow was up 1.1 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.7 percent. TECH: A BIG ACT TO FOLLOW About 24 percent of S&P 500 companies will report their third-quarter earnings next week, among them heavy hitters such as General Motors ( GM.N ) and Visa ( V.N ). But Apple, reporting on Monday, and Facebook, on Wednesday, are likely to be the most-watched names. \"These are big names that people like to look at and they create a feeling about the market,\" said Synovus Trust\\'s Morgan. He said he will be looking to see if Apple has reversed the negative trend in iPad sales of the second quarter. But, he noted, Apple\\'s multiple is low, at a 12.25 price-to-earnings forward ratio, compared with Facebook, which has a 55.45 P/E multiple. Right now, the market is optimistic, particularly for Facebook options. That market is pricing in more upside risk than downside risk for Facebook shares heading into earnings next week. A metric known as skew, which measures the perceived volatility priced into out-of-the-money puts versus out-of-the-money calls on a stock, is inverted - meaning it costs more for options that anticipate upside rather than downside. \"This is the opposite of what we typically see in the stock market, since most investors are long stocks and therefore more concerned about downside risk,\" said Matt Franz, at Stutland Volatility Group in Chicago. ENERGY TURNS UP THE HEAT Second only to technology, the energy sector of the S&P 500 has beaten analysts\\' earnings expectations in 73 percent of the results reported so far. The focus will stay on the group next week, with results from Exxon ( XOM.N ) , Chevron ( CVX.N ) and Valero ( VLO.N ). As a cyclical sector tied to the pace of economic growth, \"better earnings and especially better guidance ... are going to say good things about the economy going forward,\" said Tom Schrader, managing director of U.S. trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets, who focuses on energy stocks. Forward guidance from refiners may be positive if companies price in news that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is considering lowering the required amount of ethanol to be blended into engine fuels, said Schrader. If the government\\'s September jobs number was any indication, economic data that is relatively within expectations, even if weak, will fuel investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep stimulating the economy at current levels. ADP\\'s national employment report, due on Wednesday, will show the number of non-farm private sector jobs added to payrolls in October. Unlike the Department of Labor\\'s October jobs report, ADP will not account for public sector jobs that were temporarily lost during the partial government shutdown. If it did, that might present a clearer picture of the nation\\'s employment rate. The Conference Board\\'s Consumer Confidence Index, to be released on Tuesday, will account for the government shutdown and reveal how big a hit U.S. spending habits took as a result.

      "{'text': ' Japan\\'s economy shrank less than initially estimated in the fourth quarter as companies ramped up capital expenditure, but the current account swung to a record deficit in January as a shift away from nuclear power pushes up fossil fuel imports. \\n The revision to GDP showed a 0.2 percent contraction, bang in line with the median market forecast as companies look to an increase in demand due to reconstruction of the country\\'s tsunami-battered northeast coast. The current account balance also took a hit in January because Chinese Lunar New Year holiday weighed on exports, but economists see the result as a one-off and expect annual current account to remain in surplus for the next few years. The figures on GDP could be a welcome sign for Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda as he tries to muster support for next fiscal year\\'s budget and a controversial plan to double the 5 percent sales tax. \"The economy will resume growing in the first quarter as exports increase and as rebuilding after the earthquake proceeds. The economic recovery will continue into the new fiscal year starting from April,\" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, chief economist at Shinkin Asset Management Co in Tokyo. \"There are a lot of risk factors, such as a strong yen and Europe\\'s debt crisis, but these risks have been receding.\" <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ GDP in Japan, U.S., Europe  link.reuters.com/tys56s Current account, exports  link.reuters.com/cec56s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> On an annualized basis, the economy shrank 0.7 percent, also in line with forecasts, and less than a preliminary 2.3 percent annualized contraction, the Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday. JPGDR1=ECI Capital expenditure, the main driver of the upward revisions, rose 4.8 percent, slightly less than a 5.0 percent rise expected by economists, but well ahead of a preliminary reading of a 1.9 percent rise. Larger-than-expected gains in industrial production and bullish output forecasts for the first quarter have raised hopes that Japan\\'s economy will gather momentum this year. Japan\\'s current account balance swung to a record deficit of 437.3 billion yen ($5.41 billion)in January, deeper than the median estimate for a 317.8 billion yen deficit. Japan logged its first shortfall since January 2009 due to a gaping trade deficit as exports plunged on holiday-thinned Chinese demand while higher fuel costs and nuclear plant shutdowns after last year\\'s earthquake pushed up energy imports. The yen slipped to trade at 81.26 per dollar as a current account deficit raises doubts about how long Japan will be able to fund its large public debt domestically. Economists say it may be some time before Japan consistently runs a deficit in its current account given the income generated on investments overseas. \"The trade balance is likely to stay in deficit this year as we import more energy to offset the declining use of nuclear power,\" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities Research & Consulting. \"The current account should swing back to a surplus as we still have a surplus in the income account. Japan should be able to finance its debt for the time being. But if it is a question of what happens five to 10 years from now, we cannot be so certain.\" The Bank of Japan is likely to leave monetary policy unchanged at its next meeting on March 12-13. The BOJ surprised markets on February 14 by easing monetary policy with a 10 trillion yen ($123.86 billion) increase in government bond purchases and set an inflation goal of 1 percent, signaling more vigorous efforts to end deflation.

JPGDR1=ECI -- Capital expenditure rose a revised 4.8 percent, compared with a 5.0 percent rise expected by economists and a preliminary reading of a 1.9 percent rise. -- Japan\\'s current account balance swung to a deficit of 437.3 billion yen ($5.41 billion) in January, more than the median estimate for a record 317.8 billion yen deficit as exports sank at the start of the year. JPCURA=ECI COMMENTARY: NORIO MIYAGAWA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES RESEARCH & CONSULTING, TOKYO \"The upward revision in capital expenditure explains the revision to GDP. From here on, exports won\\'t be too strong because overseas economies are slowing. \"Factory output will rebound, however, as the impact from floods in Thailand is receding and domestic subsidies for energy-efficient goods will help the economy. Reconstruction-related demand will also play a part. \"The trade balance is likely to stay in deficit this year as we import more energy to offset the declining use of nuclear power. \"The current account should swing back to a surplus as we still have a surplus in the income account. Japan should be able to finance its debt for the time being. But if it is a question of what happens five to 10 years from now, we cannot be so certain.\" TAKESHI MINAMI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NORINCHUKIN RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO \"Capital expenditure growth is accelerating, but overall, the revised GDP figures were within expectations. \"We cannot count on any strong growth in exports, but as a whole, we\\'ll probably see positive economic growth in the first quarter of this year. Public expenditure growth will also support the economy in April-June, so the economy will likely expand solidly in the new business year from April, once exports bottom out. \"The Bank of Japan acted boldly last month, so it will probably stand pat next week.\" HIROSHI MIYAZAKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SHINKIN ASSET MANAGEMENT CO, TOKYO \"The economy will resume growing in the first quarter as exports increase and as rebuilding proceeds after the earthquake. The economic recovery will continue into the new fiscal year starting from April. \"There are a lot of risk factors, such as a strong yen and Europe\\'s debt crisis, but these risks have been receding. \"A weakening yen will help corporate earnings. Consumption is likely to improve. Companies will also think twice about delaying domestic capital expenditure.\" BACKGROUND: -- The Bank of Japan is likely to leave monetary policy unchanged at its next meeting on March 12-13. The BOJ surprised markets on February 14 by easing monetary policy with a 10 trillion yen ($123.86 billion) increase in government bond purchases and set an inflation goal of 1 percent, signaling a more aggressive stance to end deflation. -- The yen has since slipped and is now trading near a nine-month low versus the dollar, going some way to easing concerns that a strong currency could weigh on exports and delay Japan\\'s economic recovery. -- Larger-than-expected gains in industrial production and bullish output forecasts for the first quarter have raised hopes that Japan\\'s economy will gather momentum this year.

      "{'text': ' Greece secured an overwhelming acceptance of a bond swap offer to private creditors and beat its own most optimistic forecasts, a senior official said on Thursday after the deadline expired on a deal needed to avoid a chaotic debt default. \\n A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said take-up on the offer was around 95 percent an hour before the offer closed at 2000 GMT with responses still coming in. The biggest sovereign debt restructuring in history will see bond holders accept losses of some 74 percent on the value of their investments in a deal that will cut more than 100 billion euros from Greece\\'s crippling public debt. Preliminary results from the offer are expected to be announced officially at 0600 GMT on Friday and Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos will hold a news conference before a call with euro zone finance ministers in the afternoon. After initial fears that the deal could fail altogether, pitching Greece and the euro zone into fresh crisis, the unexpectedly strong result may mean that Athens can avoid enforcing the exchange on recalcitrant holdouts. The government had been expected to activate so-called collective action clauses (CACs) on all 177 billion euros worth of bonds regulated under Greek law. That would potentially trigger payouts on the credit default swaps (CDS) that some investors held on the bonds, an event which would have unknown consequences for the market. The private sector involvement (PSI) deal is a key element in a broader international bailout aimed at averting a chaotic default by Greece and a potentially disastrous banking crisis across the euro zone. The European Union and International Monetary Fund have made a successful bond swap a pre-condition for final approval of the 130 billion euros ($170 billion) bailout agreed last month. \"If all goes well, tomorrow we will be able to announce that a debt burden of 105 billion euros has been lifted from the Greek people,\" Venizelos told parliament earlier in the day. \"For the first time we are cutting debt instead of adding to it.\" OPTIMISM Despite the apparent success, the deal will not solve Greece\\'s deep-seated problems and at best it may buy time for a country facing its biggest economic crisis since World War Two and staggering under debt equal to 160 percent of its gross domestic product. However financial markets rose strongly as the threat of an immediate and uncontrolled default receded. Bank stocks rose sharply and the risk premium on Italian and Spanish government bonds fell as investors hoped a Greek deal would curb the likelihood of any contagion spreading to other weaker euro zone economies. Euro zone ministers could decide whether to clear the overall bailout package in their conference call on Friday afternoon, although they may leave the final decision until a face-to-face meeting on Monday. Athens must have the funds in place by March 20 when some 14.5 billion euros of bonds are due, which it cannot hope to repay alone. Greece has staggered from deadline to deadline since the crisis broke two years ago and several of its international partners have expressed open doubts about whether its second major bailout in two years will be the last. Underlining the severe problems facing Greece after five years of deep recession, data on Thursday showed unemployment running at a record 21 percent in December, twice the euro zone average, with 51 percent of young people without a job. There has been growing resentment over the austerity medicine ordered by international creditors which has compounded the pain from a slump which has seen the economy shrink by a fifth since 2008. But Greece, totally reliant on international support to stave off bankruptcy, has also infuriated both the European Union and the International Monetary Fund with its repeated failure to push through promised reforms. \"We have shown a lot of solidarity with Greece,\" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said late on Wednesday. \"Everyone knows that the real problems of Greek society are in Greece and not abroad.\" ($1 = 0.7625 euros) (Additional reporting by Harry Papachristou and Angeliki Koutantou and Aloisio Alves in Rio di Janaeiro; writing by  James Mackenzie ; editing by  Jon Boyle )', 'date': ' Thu Mar 8, 2012 6:56pm EST\\n', 'title': ' Massive take-up of Greece bond swap offer\\n', 'author': ' By George Georgiopoulos and Lefteris Papadimas\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/08/us-greece-idUSBRE8270FH20120308\\n\\n \\n\\n ATHENS  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Suntech Power Holdings STP.N and JinkoSolar Holding Co ( JKS.N ) became the latest solar companies to record big impairment charges, as losses mount on weak demand and a steep fall in prices. \\n The solar industry was hit hard last year as prices for the equipment that turns sunlight into electricity halved, pushing many companies into losses and forcing the likes of First Solar ( FSLR.O ), SolarWorld AG ( SWVG.DE ), MEMC Electronic Materials WFR.N and Yingli Green Energy ( YGE.N ) to incur huge charges. Suntech, the world\\'s biggest producer of photovoltaic solar panels, said on Thursday its operating expenses in the third quarter included non-cash, impairment charges of $482.9 million, while JinkoSolar took a $7.3 million hit in the fourth quarter. \"Due to the challenging solar market conditions and the significant reduction in the company\\'s market capitalization in the third quarter of 2011, Suntech initiated an assessment of its goodwill, intangibles, and certain investments,\" the company said in a statement. Given the reduced profitability of solar companies, more writedowns could be expected this year, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jeff Osborne said. Suntech shares have lost 69 percent of their value in the last one year, while JinkoSolar shares have shed about three-quarters of their value. This compares with a 66 percent decline in the broader MAC Global Solar Energy Index .SUNIDX. JinkoSolar shares fell as much as 12 percent on Thursday morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Suntech shares fell 4 percent. \"I don\\'t expect to see a broad recovery by the end of this year, even if the end market grows significantly,\" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Ben Schuman said. TRADE WAR To add to Chinese solar companies\\' growing worries is a trade war that could see the United States imposing tariffs on imports from the Asian country. Germany\\'s SolarWorld\\'s U.S. subsidiary and six anonymous peers filed a trade complaint in October, contending that China\\'s support of its solar companies breached global trade rules and that those companies were dumping equipment in the U.S. market below the cost of production. The Chinese manufacturers have denied the charges, but many are preparing for Washington to impose tariffs. \"Our market size of course has the potential to be impacted by the outcome of the petition to impose tariffs on China-made solar cells,\" Suntech Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Beebe said on a conference call with analysts. \"Ironically this case was entered by SolarWorld, a German company who has avoided providing any information on the extraordinary amount of subsidies from Germany, U.S. and governments in the Middle East,\" Beebe said. PROFITLESS GROWTH? Suntech forecast full-year shipments of 2.1 GW to 2.5 GW, marginally higher than the 2.09 GW it shipped last year. For 2012, JinkoSolar expects total solar module shipments of 800 megawatt (MW) to 1,000 MW, higher than last year\\'s 760.8 MW. Suntech\\'s Beebe said the company expects growth from the United States, China, India and Japan to roughly offset decline in the European market. \"These markets are intensely competitive. So you could have a spinning wheel of volume growth for the industry offset by profitless prosperity,\" Stifel\\'s Osborne said. However, Suntech expects first-quarter shipments to decline by about 30 percent from the fourth. \"This could be the first year that Suntech does not gain market share in the five years we\\'ve covered it,\" Raymond James analysts Pavel Molchanov and Alex Morris wrote in a note. Suntech, however, said it had seen stronger-than-expected demand from Germany as customers rushed to stock up before the world\\'s No. 2 solar market cut its renewable energy subsidies. Germany plans to advance cuts in solar power subsidies of up to 30 percent by almost a month to March 9. Record solar installations in Germany in December surprised most in the industry, with an estimated 3 gigawatt of panels added in the world\\'s biggest solar market. On Thursday, Suntech and JinkoSolar posted a quarterly loss.

      "{'text': \" Bankers' salaries will likely grow at the fastest rate in Asia Pacific this year, rising by twice as much in the United States, according to an industry survey, cementing the region's reputation as one of the hottest but costliest markets to hire in. \\n Elsewhere, including in Europe, salaries across the financial sector are also likely to rise in 2012 but at much slower rate than in Asia and not for bank chief executives, a survey by human resources consultancy Mercer forecast. Banks with an Asian focus, such as HSBC and Standard Chartered, were hit by rising wages bills last year from expanding in the region, though strong growth there did boost revenues. Standard Chartered registered a 15 percent rise in staff costs as it competed to hire and retain executives. Mercer found that in Asia, financial services salaries were set to rise 5 percent on average in 2012, while in the United States the pay hikes would likely reach 2.5 percent and in EMEA 2 percent. The group surveyed 63 firms in December 2011, the bulk of which were banks. A quarter were insurance companies. Most of the firms it contacted in Asia Pacific were based in Hong Kong, Australia and China. Base salaries were historically never a big part of investment bankers' compensation packages, but after a post-financial crisis crackdown by regulators in Europe on bonus structures, base pay has risen dramatically. At many top investment banks, salaries doubled after 2009, with senior executives getting up to 300,000 pounds ($471,200) in base pay, according to headhunters and bankers. This has made salaries a much more important factor when it comes to retaining and recruiting staff, and international banks in Asia for instance compete with local firms on this basis. FEW BONUS CHANGES Still, bonuses remain a big focus for regulators, politicians and the media, with banks in the UK still under intense pressure to rein in rewards after several lenders were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. Bonus structures have been overhauled, with big chunks deferred and paid in shares rather than in cash upfront. Half of the firms surveyed by Mercer said they did not plan to change bonus designs in 2012. Those that do said they would review the performance measures awards are based on or introduce conditions upon which bonus can be clawed back - a feature banks are only just starting to use. Britain's Lloyds and HSBC were among those that clawed back bonuses this year in connection with mis-selling incidents. But although payout structures have changed, the size of rewards is still a contentious point, particularly in Europe, even if most investment banks, hit by turmoil in the euro zone last year, slashed bonus pools for 2011. According to Mercer, only 10 percent of firms looking at bonus changes said they were considering reducing the maximum payouts in their annual bonus plans. Banks can sometimes restrict how big a bonus is versus base pay, and tighten the criteria. But the ratio of bonuses to revenues and bonuses to pre-tax profits did fall from 2010 to 2011 at the banks that responded to Mercer's survey. The majority of financial services firms also do not plan to change their long-term incentive plans, Mercer said. Staff in so-called control roles - such as in risk management, audit and compliance - are likely to receive the biggest average pay rises in 2012, the report added. These staff could get pay rises of more than 3 percent. These roles have gained prominence as regulators have cracked down on banks and scrutinized rewards for key risk-takers.

      "{'text': ' Chrysler Group LLC\\'s top executive declined a salary and bonus for a second straight year in 2011, when the Detroit automaker repaid more than $7 billion in government loans from its bankruptcy restructuring nearly three years ago. \\n Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne is still compensated as CEO of Italian automaker Fiat SpA, which owns 58.5 percent of Chrysler and paid him 3.5 million euros ($4.5 million) in 2010. Chrysler did reimburse Marchionne, however, for cleaning, security and other costs at his condominium in Michigan, according to an annual regulatory filing released late Tuesday. Marchionne has been CEO of both automakers since Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy in June 2009. His hard-charging style has been credited with bringing the U.S. automaker back from the brink of collapse and reviving Wall Street\\'s interest. Chrysler\\'s improved financial performance pushed its value to $7.5 billion at the end of 2011, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, a 56 percent gain from its 2010 value of $4.8 billion. \"(The increase is) primarily attributable to continued improvement in our performance and achievement of the objectives outlined in our business plan,\" Chrysler said. Chrysler reported a 2011 profit of $183 million after a $652 million loss in 2010. Its U.S. auto sales jumped 24.3 percent, outpacing the industry\\'s 10.3 percent rise, helped by the launch of 16 new and improved models. In May, Chrysler refinanced $7.6 billion of high-interest loans from the United States and Canada that were extended as part of the company\\'s 2009 bailout. Fiat later bought the equity stakes held by the U.S. and Canadian governments. FROM DETROIT TO TURIN Chrysler, which is not public, calculated the valuation to set compensation for some of its top executives, including Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer and General Counsel Holly Leese, the annual filing said. Chrysler said the value of each \"unit\" of the company, calculated from a four-year projection of cash flows and other metrics, was $7.63 as of December 31. Chrysler estimated that it is made up of 980 million units on a fully diluted basis. Marchionne has shuttled between Auburn Hills, Michigan, and Fiat\\'s headquarters in Turin, Italy, since 2009, when Fiat took management control and a one-fifth stake in Chrysler as part of the terms of the U.S. automaker\\'s bankruptcy. Chrysler said costs on his condominium were on par with or less than what it would have cost for him to stay at hotels in the area. His 2011 pay package from Fiat has not yet been disclosed. Chrysler is now Fiat\\'s chief source of financial strength, exceeding many analysts\\' expectations. Over the course of 2011 and early 2012, Fiat increased its stake in Chrysler to 58.5 percent from 20 percent. Sales to fleet customers such as rental car companies made up 27.6 percent of Chrysler\\'s overall U.S. sales last year, down from 36.1 percent in 2010, according to the filing. Fleet sales are less profitable than retail sales to consumers. But Chrysler has also made missteps, including dull sales of the Fiat 500 small car that fell far short of U.S. targets. Chrysler\\'s pension shortfall widened to $6.5 billion in 2011, just $1 billion less than its overall market value, due to falling interest rates. Improvements in workers\\' life expectancy increased the size of Chrysler\\'s liability. Chrysler\\'s larger rivals Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co are both exploring ways to soften their respective pension risks, which analysts say have taken a toll on their stock price.

Proview Technology (Shenzhen), in an open letter to China\\'s suppliers and resellers, urged them to immediately stop selling, storing and shipping the iPad as of Thursday, citing trademark infringement issues. \"Anybody who continues to do so will be seen as intentionally infringing rights and the company will adopt the most severe measures by taking legal action,\" Proview Technology said in the letter to iPad suppliers and resellers in China. The dispute has dented sales of the iPad in China, Apple\\'s second largest market by revenue, and the two sides are now awaiting a key ruling by the high court in Guangzhou after a lower court ruled in favor of the Chinese firm last year. \"This is Proview\\'s strategy to give Apple more pressure in the Chinese market, to try and add another blow to its iPad sales there,\" said Rachel He, a lawyer with the firm Guangdong Sun-Kindle. \"However, I don\\'t think it will affect the decision of the Guangzhou high court because that ruling will be based more on the new evidence presented last week,\" she said. The Higher People\\'s Court in Guangzhou heard Apple\\'s appeal on February 29 and is expected to make a decision in coming weeks or months. Proview released its latest statement after Apple on Wednesday released a faster 4G version of its iPad, offering a better screen and other new features. Chinese media have reported that Proview is seeking up to 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in compensation for trade mark infringement. Proview has said it favors an out-of-court settlement, which usually involves the payment of compensation, which analysts have said the company needs to repay its creditors. Hejun Vanguard Group, a consulting company representing Proview creditors, said in a statement late on Wednesday that the iPad trademark in China belonged to them. Proview\\'s main creditors are Bank of China Ltd, China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd, China Development Bank, China Guangfa Bank, Bank of Communications Co Ltd, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co Ltd, Hua Xia Bank Co Ltd and Shenzhen Pingan Bank.

A fourth year of interest rates at 0.50 percent looks highly probable and a fifth is far from impossible given the still difficult domestic and international conditions that the economy face. \"Our current view is that interest rates will not rise before late-2013 and the Bank of England could very well delay acting until 2014 given likely extended muted economic activity and the need to offset tight fiscal policy. \"While it is a stone dead certainty that interest rates are going nowhere for some considerable time to come, the outlook for quantitative easing is far less clear - although it is odds-on that the Bank of England will now sit tight until at least May. \"While we expect a final 25 billion pound dosage of QE to be enacted later this year (most probably in May) in response to likely ongoing fragile economic activity, it is very possible that the Bank of England could be done on the QE front barring a renewed serious downturn in economic activity.\" IAN MCCAFFERTY, CBI CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER: \"This decision was expected as the current round of asset purchases is set to run until May. \"Since the MPC has been signaling that the current policy stance is broadly appropriate, it appears that the economic climate would have to deteriorate to prompt a further extension of QE. \"Nevertheless, with economic conditions fragile and the level of uncertainty high, monetary policy decisions are still likely to be finely-balanced.\" (Reporting by UK Economics Desk)', 'date': ' Thu Mar 8, 2012 7:21am EST\\n', 'title': ' Instant View: BoE leaves rates, QE on hold as expected\\n', 'author': ' \\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/08/us-britain-boe-rates-idUSBRE8270LN20120308\\n\\n \\n\\n LONDON  ('}\n",

For Falcone, who is betting his career on bringing wireless service to rural America, that should be reason to celebrate. He still made the list even though he has fallen hard in the rankings from last year\\'s Number 540 spot when he had $2.2 billion to his name. A spokesman for the New York-based manager did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month U.S. regulators dealt a severe blow to LightSquared Inc, the startup telecommunications company Falcone\\'s Harbinger Capital Partners is bankrolling, when it said the proposed satellite system should not be allowed to operate because it interferes with GPS technology used by the military and commercial airliners. Since then LightSquared has had to lay off nearly half of its staff and find other ways to conserve cash. Tough financial conditions forced Falcone to lock up his investors\\' money after the fund lost 47 percent last year, making some already irritated investors even angrier at him, several investors who did not want to be named publicly have said. A few weeks ago, a client filed a lawsuit charging Falcone with making \"deceptive and misleading statements\" while raising money for the Harbinger fund. Despite his troubles, the former Harvard hockey star who made $1.7 billion by betting against overheated mortgages is still part of the exclusive circle that counts some of his industry\\'s most vaunted players. Hedge fund superstars George Soros, Carl Icahn, John Paulson, Ray Dalio, Steven Cohen and David Tepper all rank above him on the Forbes list. And some newcomers are fast nipping at Falcone\\'s heels for a spot on the list. Chase Coleman, a 30-something investor who got his start with industry titan Julian Robertson and now runs his own Tiger Global Management, made the Forbes list for the first time this year with a net worth of $1 billion.

Morgan Securities analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note. Last month, Microsoft released an incomplete version of Windows 8. It is the first Microsoft operating system compatible with low-power microprocessors designed by ARM Holdings Plc and will run on tablets as well as desktops and laptops, in an effort to counter the runaway success of iPad. But Apple\\'s latest iPad will allow the company to sustain its competitive advantage and drive a dominant position in the fast-growing tablet market, said analysts. According to Credit Suisse, Apple will command 66 percent share of the tablet market in 2012, thanks to its brand, hardware offering and superior ecosystem. The global tablet user base already reached 67 million in 2011, according to researcher Strategy Analytics. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook introduced the highly anticipated third iteration of the tablet, but broke away from the tradition of calling the third-generation tablet the iPad 3, as some had expected, referring to it simply as the \"new iPad.\" Still, analysts say the company \"is just getting started,\" and that it will have more to offer, including a full-fledged TV offering and a thinner iPhone 5 that may be capable of operating on the \"LTE,\" or Long-Term Evolution, network. At speeds roughly 10 times faster than current 3G technology, that may help banish the sometimes shaky video quality of older devices. \"We expect the company to have several other strong new product cycles over the next 1-2 years, including the iPhone 5 (LTE-enabled) and the iTV,\" said FBN Securities\\' analyst Shebly Seyrafi said. FBN raised its price target to $730 from $650. CHEAPER IPAD 2 The company said it will continue to sell the iPad 2 but dropped its price by $100. The older tablet now starts at $399 while the new third-generation wi-fi only iPad starts at $499. Morgan Stanley analysts said the cheaper iPad 2 will have a minimal impact on gross margins, and expect the drop in price of the device to drive incremental demand of 15 million to 20 million in the United States and 38 million worldwide. Following the cut in the price of iPad 2, Apple is now well positioned to counter competition from products at the lower end of the market like Amazon.com Inc\\'s Kindle Fire given the device\\'s superior hardware features, say analysts. \"We believe the new iPad and the lower price point for the iPad 2 will enable Apple to continue its momentum and tablet market dominance, and we continue to expect rapid installed base growth in 2012 and beyond,\" Goldman Sachs analysts, including Bill Shope, wrote in a note to clients. Analysts at Goldman raised their price target on Apple stock to $660 from $600. ThinkEquity analysts lifted their share-price target by $50 to $600. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, 25 analysts rate Apple at \"strong buy,\" another 25 at \"buy,\" while three have a \"hold\" rating. Two analysts rate the stock at \"sell\" or its equivalent rating. The 55 analysts covering Apple have a mean price target of $575.23 on the stock, which closed at $530.69 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq. Apple shares were up $3 to $533.69 in early trade. They have fallen 3 percent since touching a year-high on March 1, a day after the company\\'s market value topped the $500 billion mark.

      "{'text': ' The Treasury Department said on Wednesday it will sell $6 billion worth of American International Group stock and struck another deal for the insurer to pay down $8.5 billion more in obligations, taking a major step forward in an election year to unwind the unpopular crisis-era bailout. \\n AIG said the agreement with the government would allow it to pay down what it owed in a special purpose vehicle, AIA Aurora, and free up the company\\'s collateral against that, including interests in aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp and Asian insurer AIA Group Ltd. The special purpose vehicle was set up in December 2009 in exchange for a reduction in the debt that AIG owed the New York Federal Reserve at the time. The Treasury\\'s original interest in the vehicle was $16 billion. The stake sale is expected reduce the U.S. government\\'s ownership in AIG to about 70 percent from 77 percent, a source with knowledge of the situation said. Once the company repays Treasury for the special vehicle interest, the value of the government\\'s stake would total about $41.8 billion. The announcements come as President Barack Obama, a Democrat, fights to win a second term in office and withstands attacks from Republicans for wasting taxpayer money. \"The bottom line is this: the people of AIG have achieved another significant milestone in our progress toward our goal that American taxpayers recoup their entire investment in AIG at a profit,\" AIG Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said in a statement. Earlier this week, AIG sold part of its stake in AIA to raise about $6 billion to repay the government. Following the share sale, AIG holds about 19 percent of AIA. STOCK PRICE RUN-UP AIG had to be rescued during the financial crisis of 2008 through multiple bailouts, under both the Obama and Bush administrations, with the U.S. government at one point pledging some $182 billion to keep the insurer afloat. In the last few years, Benmosche has been trying to steady the ship and selling off non-core assets to pay back the government. Last month the company reported a net profit of nearly $20 billion for the fourth quarter. While the outsized profit was a one-time event linked to a tax accounting change, underlying it was a long-term assumption that the company has stopped its multibillion dollar crisis-era losses. The share sale plan comes as AIG\\'s stock price has run up some 27 percent this year, possibly giving the government an opportunity to offload some of its stake without having to take a loss. For the government to break-even on its investment in AIG, it needs to sell shares at about $29. The stock closed up 1.4 percent on Wednesday at $29.45, although it fell about 1.9 percent in aftermarket trading following the announcements. The source said the shares have not been priced yet. Treasury declined to comment on the pricing. PLAN DETAILS Under the latest plan, AIG intends to repurchase up to $3 billion of its stock in the Treasury\\'s offering once it is priced. The Treasury will also grant an option to the underwriters for the offering to purchase an additional $900 million worth of stock. The U.S. government hired Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley to coordinate the offering, choosing a different set of bankers than AIG had when it first sold stock early last year. The choice is a reversal in fortunes for the two U.S. investment banks. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley had played key roles in the insurer\\'s restructuring but were left out of the coveted lead bookrunner roles in the offering last year. AIG is expected to repay the $8.5 billion owed under the AIA vehicle with proceeds from several sources, the Treasury said. The company expects to pay $5.6 billion from the sale of the AIA stake. It expects to get $1.6 billion in escrowed cash proceeds from an earlier sale of its life insurance unit, American Life Insurance Co, to MetLife Inc. AIG also expects to get $1.6 billion as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sells off the last of the securities held in Maiden Lane II LLC, a vehicle that was created to buy mortgage backed securities from AIG during the financial crisis as part of its bailout.

      "{'text': ' Families took on more debt in late 2011 for the first time in 3-1/2 years but a rise in after-tax incomes left consumers in better shape to spend. \\n Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits rose last week, but not enough to change perceptions the labor market was strengthening. The economy is still limping back from a financial crisis that wreaked havoc on household finances and put millions of people out of work. However, rising incomes eased the pinch in the fourth quarter. The ratio of household liabilities to after-tax income - a broad measure of the debt burden - fell to 117.5 percent, its lowest level since 2004. Economists are unsure how much more that debt burden must decline for consumers to feel normal again, but Thursday\\'s data pointed to progress. \"Any little inroads we make bring us that much closer to getting back to a normal rate of consumer spending,\" said Ellen Zentner, an economist at Nomura in New York. In a separate report, Labor Department data showed initial claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week to 362,000. Still, new claims remained near the four-year low reached last month. \"You are bound to get some uptick even when the overall trend is downward. The labor market is improving, but it\\'s still quite impaired,\" said Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. A closely watched report on employment on Friday is expected to show solid job growth in February and could reduce chances of more monetary stimulus from the Fed, which meets on Tuesday. The government is expected to report the economy added 210,000 new jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey. THE WEALTH EFFECT U.S. financial markets largely ignored Thursday\\'s data, with traders taking their cue from developments on Greece\\'s efforts to get private creditors to join a bond-swap deal. With labor market conditions improving, Americans appear more willing and more able to take on debt. Consumer credit swelled by 6.9 percent during last three months of 2011, the Fed said. It was the biggest gain since the same period in 2001 when credit was surging in the wake of the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington. Other reports have shown that much of the recent surge in borrowing has been to buy cars and pay for college. In the fourth quarter, the Fed\\'s report showed households continued to shed mortgage debt, which declined at a 1.5 percent annual rate. That was the smallest drop in two years, suggesting Americans were closer to recovering from the debt hangover left by a burst housing bubble. It also showed household wealth increased by $1.2 trillion, with a drop in the value of real estate tempering gains from stocks. The extra wealth could lead consumers to spend more, especially if home prices bottom out, as some analysts expect. \"The combined wealth effects from financial and housing assets (will likely) begin lending increasing support to consumption growth as the year progresses,\" Troy Davig, an economist at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients. Still, families have struggled to rebuild their net wealth after the country\\'s housing bubble popped and triggered the last recession. Household net wealth in the fourth quarter was still about 13 percent below its peak in the second quarter of 2007.

      "{'text': ' Beijing and the influential U.S. agriculture department may have overstated China\\'s corn crop by as much as 14 percent, pointing to higher imports from the world\\'s second-largest consumer of the grain that could squeeze already tightening global supplies. \\n If China plugs the gap between projected and actual domestic supply with additional corn imports, it would drive up international prices already near four-month highs. Wheat markets could feel the impact too if Beijing snaps up the grain as a substitute to corn for animal feed. \"Many are skeptical over the corn output figure,\" said Li Qiang, a senior analyst with JC Intelligence (JCI), an influential consultancy. \"The industry expected an output increase, but not by as much as the bureau says.\" China\\'s National Bureau of Statistics said that farms produced a record corn crop in 2011 of 191.8 million tonnes. But enthusiastic local officials often overstate the size of crops in China to impress central authorities and win bigger subsidies. A Reuters investigation based on assessments from some cooperatives, key trading houses and JCI suggests that Beijing has overstated the crop size by between 6.8 million tonnes and 24 million tonnes, the equivalent of between 12 days and 44 days of consumption. The impact of tighter-than-expected supplies is already being felt in the domestic market. Competition between local industry processors and state-owned procurement agencies for supplies is pushing domestic prices higher. State grain buyers are struggling to replenish depleted national stocks, raising the risk the government will limit purchases by processors, whose rapid expansion has been blamed by Beijing for threatening the country\\'s grains supply. Strategic stocks are well below the government\\'s comfort level after three years in which Beijing has drawn them down to boost domestic supply and dampen food prices driven higher by growing demand for meat from an increasingly affluent population. Low stockpiles give Beijing little wriggle room before it has to import. The United States Department of Agriculture, whose figures international traders rely on to gauge global demand and supply, estimates the record crop plus imports of four million tonnes will meet China\\'s demand this year. But it may need much more to plug the supply shortfall caused by the crop overestimate, bolstering a global corn market already being hampered by a severe drought in agriculture powerhouses Brazil and Argentina. Just two weeks ago, China bought 120,000 tonnes, it\\'s first purchase since the harvest was completed late last year. Chicago Board of Trade benchmark corn prices hit their highest levels since January this week as drought in agricultural powerhouses Brazil and Argentina worried buyers, although the price is well off the highs of 2010 and 2011. U.S. corn stocks are forecast by the U.S. agriculture department to shrink this year to their smallest level in 16 years, reducing U.S. export potential to meet China\\'s needs. Still, global wheat supplies are in a better position to take up some of the slack. Major producer Australia is expecting record-high wheat output this year, adding to bumper supplies from the Black Sea region. World wheat stocks at the end of the 2011/12 season look set to eclipse the previous record set more than a decade ago, according to the International Grains Council (IGC), which raised its forecast for production to an all-time high. That will encourage China to buy more wheat and only take corn when prices dip or look relatively cheap. \"They are smart buyers so they will be very opportunistic, choosing the right time to buy,\" said Adam Davis, a senior commodity analyst at Merricks Capital in Melbourne. \"We see year-on-year increase in corn imports, just as we did with soybean imports.\" <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ China corn yields, acreage:  link.reuters.com/tet76s Corn versus soy imports:  link.reuters.com/xet76s China pork production:  link.reuters.com/set76s Top corn importers, exporters:  r.reuters.com/cav42s China-Argentina pact to heat up competition for U.S. corn: Daily grain market wrap: <GRA/> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> HOW MUCH LESS? The government\\'s subsidy policy has led farmers to increase acreage dedicated to corn and grow less soybeans, so a rise in output could be expected. But JCI estimates China\\'s corn crop at 168 million tonnes, close to 24 million tonnes lower than the official data. JCI was the first to challenge the high official corn crop estimates in 2009, and the consultancy\\'s skepticism was borne out by China\\'s 2010 imports. Official think-tank China National Grain and Oils Information Centre puts the harvest at 185 million tonnes, more than 6 million tonnes below the official estimate. Some traders from state-owned grains trading houses pegged output at about 180 million tonnes. China\\'s officials say it has enough corn reserves and will not need to import large quantities this year. But traders are skeptical, arguing the officials are trying to talk prices down ahead of a shopping spree. The growing realization that domestic corn supplies are tighter than previously thought is driving prices higher. Farmers have held on to their grain in expectation prices will rise more. Physical corn prices at Dalian, China\\'s largest grains port, have risen to 2,400 yuan a tonne, the highest since October and edging towards the record of 2,480 a tonne reached before the harvest started in October. \"Corn processors have been raising their purchase prices because farmers are not selling,\" said Zheng Guichen, deputy general manager with Dacheng Group, the country\\'s top corn processor based in Jilin province in the northeast corn belt. \"We believe farmers are holding more than half of their harvest here in Jilin as they are in no rush to sell.\" GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION? China does not publish its inventory figures. But traders estimate that it has 10 million tonnes of stocks, which is less than a month of consumption and far less than the three months of consumption Beijing considers ideal. Sinograin, which manages the state grains reserves, has offered to buy grain at about 10 percent to 20 percent below market to replenish stocks. Official data shows the government has sold about 55 million tonnes of reserves since 2009 to damp down local prices. With farmers holding out for higher prices, sources said Sinograin has fallen well short of its plan to buy 10-12 million tonnes of corn by the end of January. They estimate it has not managed to secure any significant volume since the stockpiling campaign started in mid-December. The risk for industrial processors is that the government will step in, like it did in 2011, and order them to stop buying to make way for state reserve purchases. Aware of its longer-term import needs, China is increasing its supply sources, having relied on U.S. corn imports so far. It signed a trade pact earlier this month with Argentina, the world\\'s second-largest exporter, and suppliers in the Black Sea grain belt are looking at sales to China for the first time. \"China is a tough market, we have not sold anything to it as yet, but there may be opportunity in the future,\" said Andrew Druzyaka, an official of the State Food and Grain Corp of Ukraine, at a conference in Singapore last month. APPETITE China is widely expected to dominate the global corn trade in the years ahead after becoming a net importer just three years ago. Many analysts see the rise in corn imports mirroring the quick rise in soy imports that have made China the top soy importer. Imports of 3.77 million tonnes of corn in 2011 were the highest since 1993-1994. China will quadruple its purchases of corn, the U.S. agriculture department said in a 10-year outlook. China\\'s grain output is failing to keep pace with demand because of the rapid expansion of its livestock industry, which is quickly turning from backyard farms to an organized industry of large modern complexes that require more corn to ensure steady supplies. To keep pace, the country\\'s largest corn consumer, New Hope Group, says Beijing should free up imports of grain for animals and redefine the country\\'s grain security policy by only placing restrictions on imports for human consumption.

      "{'text': ' The new iPad\\'s faster data speeds will likely impress consumers, right up until they get a nasty surprise in the form of increased wireless service fees. \\n To counter the shock, analysts say AT&T Inc and Verizon Wireless need to get creative with their data pricing. Apple Inc\\'s U.S. iPad partners AT&T and Verizon Wireless base their mobile Web access fees on customer usage, unlike Sprint Nextel, which does not sell the iPad but still offers unlimited data use for a flat fee. Buyers of the new iPad who use it a lot on the go may end up paying more than the typical monthly fees, which start at $15 at AT&T and $20 at Verizon Wireless. Some may opt for a Wi-Fi only iPad in order to avoid service provider fees entirely. But if operators adjust their data plans, they could avoid upsetting existing subscribers and maybe even attract new ones who might have been leaning toward Wi-Fi only, according to analysts. \"In our view, current tablet data plans offered by AT&T and Verizon seem ill-matched for the new LTE iPad, which has the potential to consume a lot of data,\" Guggenheim Partners analyst Sing Yin said in a research note. \"However, a multi-device data plan could make the LTE option more attractive.\" Telecom executives have realized for some time that their pricing models for tablets are unattractive. A vast majority of consumers have voted with their wallets by opting for Wi-Fi only versions of previous iPad models over the tablets with connections to the carriers\\' networks. As early as May 2011, Verizon Wireless told Reuters it was looking at data service plan changes. Verizon Communications Inc Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo told an investor conference last month that his company would come out with some form of account-based billing by the middle of this year: People in family plans or corporate accounts would be able to share a single bucket of minutes. This would not eliminate usage-based billing but would give customers with multiple devices more flexibility. \"You have enterprise customers. You have family (customers) who have a number of devices in their portfolio where they would just want to pay a price and share the data instead of buying an individual data plan for each phone,\" Shammo said. Such changes could go a long way toward encouraging use of the iPad on the cellular network, UBS analyst John Hodulik said in an interview ahead of Wednesday\\'s launch of the new iPad. \"That will promote people to buy more devices that are connected to the cellular network,\" Hodulik said. \"People are very focused on how much data they use.\" Verizon Wireless is a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc.

The Bank of America settlement is also part of the sweeping $25 billion agreement reached between state and federal authorities. Final settlement documents have yet to be filed in the BoA settlement, which the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office said was the largest ever False Claims Act payout related to mortgage fraud. The settlement resolved claims that Bank of America\\'s Countywide Financial subsidiaries defrauded the Federal Housing Administration by inflating appraisals used for government-insured home loans, as well as claims involving the Home Affordable Modification Program, a federal program to help American homeowners facing foreclosure. The complaint unsealed Wednesday was filed by whistleblower Gregory Mackler, a Colorado resident who said he worked alongside Bank of America executives while an employee at Urban Lending Solutions, a company to which Bank of America contracted some of its HAMP work. While working at Urban Lending, Mackler said he saw BofA and its loan servicing subsidiary, BAC Homes Loans Servicing LP, implement \"business practices designed to intentionally prevent scores of eligible homeowners from becoming eligible or staying eligible for permanent HAMP modification.\" The bank and its agents routinely pretended to have lost homeowners\\' documents, failed to credit payments during trial modifications and intentionally misled homeowners about their eligibility for the program, the complaint alleged. BoA let through just enough HAMP modifications to avert suspicion and allay congressional critics, while not enough to incur any substantial losses to its own bottom line, according to the complaint. \"In other words, BoA has had it both ways. BoA has continued to maximize the value of its mortgage portfolio with anti-HAMP modification practices and managed to make money by committing fraud on homeowner,\" the lawsuit said. A lawyer for Mackler could neither confirm nor deny that the complaint was tied to the settlement. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\\'s office and a representative for Bank of America declined to comment. In February, a whistleblower complaint was unsealed from Kyle Lagow, a former employee in a Countrywide appraisal unit which detailed allegations of Countrywide\\'s \"corrupt underwriting and appraisal process.\" Bank of America purchased Countywide in June 2008. Under the False Claims Act, successful whistleblower complaints can earn that whistleblower up to 25 percent of the settlement amount. According to the docket, the U.S. Department of Justice has until March 16 to decide whether to intervene in both the Mackler and Lagow case. The case is United States of America v. Bank of America NA et al., in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, no. 11-3270.

But results in the second half of 2012 should benefit from the first effects of its three-year turnaround plan, it added, without giving a specific forecast. Air France-KLM pledged in January to cut debt by 2 billion euros by the end of 2014 and said it would shrink its fleet by shedding more than a billion euros from a planned expansion project. Air France-KLM\\'s European rivals are also feeling the pinch from higher fuel costs and the effects of the euro zone debt crisis on passenger and cargo demand. British Airways owner IAG ( ICAG.L ) said last week underperforming Spanish unit Iberia and high fuel costs would dent earnings this year, though it reported a forecast-beating rise in 2011 profit. Irish airline Aer Lingus ( AERL.I ) warned profit would fall this year due to higher fuel costs, while Finnish national carrier Finnair ( FIA1S.HE ) last month reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss due to higher fuel costs and a weaker economy. German rival Deutsche Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) posted a surprise full-year loss on Wednesday, though it attributed this to a larger-than-expected charge on the sale of its British Midland unit to IAG. As part of its transformation plan, Air France-KLM, in which the French government holds 15.84 percent, has scaled down plans to grow capacity by 2014 in an effort to improve the demand per available seat, a method of pushing up average revenue. TOUGH YEAR It is also deferring deliveries of several Airbus ( EAD.PA ) and Boeing ( BA.N ) aircraft. Air France-KLM posted an operating loss of 353 million euros for 2011, compared with a profit of 28 million euros in the previous year, reflecting a 904 million euro hike in its fuel bill, the airline said. No dividend will be paid for 2011, it said. \"2011 was a tough year for the group, due to the uncertain operating environment and the high fuel price,\" Chief Executive Jean-Cyril Spinetta said in a statement. Oddo analysts said the loss was in line with its forecasts. Shares in Air France-KLM, which have lost around 65 percent of their value in the last 12 months, were trading 2 percent higher at 4.27 euros at 1123 GMT, in line with the SBF120 index  .SBF120 , up 2.1 percent. Spinetta was recalled as chief executive in addition to his chairman role last November, following months of underperformance at the airline compared with rivals.

And that will increase the pressure on ratings,\" S&P credit analyst Bei Fu said in a news release. The company in the past month downgraded Yanlord Land Group, Coastal Greenland, Yuzhou Properties and Zhong An Real Estate. The rating agency says small developers that are highly concentrated in certain cities and projects are vulnerable to policy risk while bigger, diversified developers stand to benefit. \"Some small and mid-sized companies may find it increasingly hard to maintain their competitive positions when lenders and investors turn cautious on higher-risk credits,\" the agency stated. \"But large and well-capitalized developers will continue to grow by acquiring land at now deflated land prices and accessing funding.\" Standard & Poor\\'s predicts that China\\'s home prices could drop 10 percent between June 2011 and June 2012. Sales volume is likely to be flat at best or slip this year, the agency said. That poses a problem for cash-strapped developers that have found their access to bank loans curtailed. Many have turned to expensive short-term credit such as trust loans. S&P said refinancing risks for developers are rising thanks to higher bank borrowing costs and high yields in the bond market.

      "{'text': ' The Justice Department has warned Apple and five major U.S. publishers that it plans to sue them, accusing them of colluding to raise the prices of electronic books, a person familiar with the probe said on Thursday. \\n Several parties have held talks to settle the potential antitrust case, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The five publishers facing possible Justice Department action are Simon & Schuster Inc, a unit of CBS Corp; Lagardere SCA\\'s Hachette Book Group; Pearson Plc\\'s Penguin Group (USA); Macmillan, a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH; and HarperCollins Publishers Inc, a unit of News Corp. U.S. and European officials have been investigating whether e-book publishers and Apple fixed prices in the growing electronic book industry, blocking rivals and hurting consumers. Publishers adopted an \"agency model\" in 2010, around the time that Apple launched the iPad, allowing publishers to set the price of e-books. In turn, Apple would take a 30 percent cut. The Wall Street Journal first reported the Justice Department\\'s lawsuit warning to Apple and the publishers. The European Commission said in December that it was looking at the same five publishers for potential violations of antitrust law in how e-books were priced. The escalation in the antitrust probe comes as publishers battle Amazon, which had previously set its own, discounted prices for electronic books in order to sell its Kindle electronic reader. In a parallel class action lawsuit now in a Manhattan court, Apple is accused of working with publishers just before its iPad was launched in 2010. The suit brought on behalf of e-book customers, alleges Apple and the publishers colluded to shift e-book pricing from a wholesale method, where retailers pay for the product and charge what they like, to agency pricing, where publishers would tell retailers what they can charge. The class action lawsuit, filed by law firm Hagens, Berman, Sobol, Shapiro, LLP, accuses Apple of being a \"hub\" for collusion. Apple\\'s push for agency pricing was detailed in Walter Isaacson\\'s biography of Apple founder Steve Jobs. The book says that Jobs, who died in October, was aware of publishers\\' frustration with Amazon. It quotes Jobs as saying: \"So we told the publishers, \\'We\\'ll go to the agency model, where you set the price, and we get our 30 percent and yes, the customer pays a little more but that\\'s what you want anyway.\\' ... So they went to Amazon and said, \\'You\\'re going to sign an agency contract or we\\'re not going to give you the books.\\'\" An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a Justice Department spokeswoman. HarperCollins could not immediately be reached for a comment. Penguin, Hachette and Simon & Schuster declined to comment.

      "{'text': ' A group of investors is suing to block a proposed initial public offering by the owner of the 102-storey Empire State Building in at least the second lawsuit of its kind, on grounds that it unfairly undervalues their interests. \\n The Malkin family, which controls the company that owns the skyscraper, is trying to engineer a \"self-interested and one-sided\" transaction that leaves smaller investors in the dark about whether the possible $1 billion IPO is fair, according to a complaint filed on Wednesday with the New York state court in Manhattan. The putative class-action lawsuit follows a similar investor lawsuit filed March 1. Plaintiffs include investors in companies whose equity could be converted into stock of the Malkins\\' proposed new company, Empire State Realty Trust. That company would be a real estate investment trust whose holdings would include 12 office buildings, six retail properties and land in New York and Connecticut. Last month, the Malkins filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the IPO, which would consolidate several privately held companies. The shares would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"ESB\". But the plaintiffs said the offering awards too much of the value of the underlying properties to the Malkins, and improperly gives the Malkins effective voting control. Empire State Realty would have two classes of stock, with the Malkins primarily getting Class B shares that carry 50 votes per share. \"The Malkin defendants availed themselves of every opportunity to benefit from the proposed transaction at the direct expense\" of the smaller investors,\" the complaint said. In the proposed transaction, the Malkins have also allocated themselves more than $328 million in \"excess\" management fees, according to the lawsuit. SKYSCRAPER OWNER: SUIT IS \"BASELESS\" The IPO documents are subject to SEC review. \"This is a baseless lawsuit, and it goes without saying that we will vigorously oppose it,\" said a spokesman for the Malkins. Other defendants include the estate of Leona Helmsley, whose late husband Harry helped form the company now overseen by the Malkins that operates the 81-year-old Empire State Building. Following the IPO, Anthony Malkin would become chairman, chief executive and president of Empire State Realty. Malkin\\'s family has controlled and managed the Empire State Building since 1961 and the land beneath it since 2002. The building alone was recently appraised at $2.52 billion. Among its tenants are the fragrance company Coty Inc, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and career networking website operator LinkedIn Corp ( LNKD.N ). In the nine months ended September 30, the proposed Empire State Realty Trust generated $71 million of profit on revenue of $382.2 million, with more than 40 percent of revenue coming from the Empire State Building.

American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) fell 3.9 percent to $28.31 after the U.S. Treasury priced its $6 billion offering of AIG stock at $29 a share.

      "{'text': ' The Bank of England left its monetary policy unchanged on Thursday, deciding that February\\'s extra 50 billion pounds ($79 billion) of quantitative easing was enough for now to support the economy through a period of fitful recovery. \\n None of the economists polled by Reuters last week had expected the BoE to deviate from the latest three-month program of gilt purchases with new money, announced last month, and the debate is increasingly shifting to whether there will be more QE in May. February\\'s meeting showed growing divisions on the Monetary Policy Committee, despite the majority vote to raise the QE total by 50 billion pounds to 325 billion. Two MPC members wanted a 75 billion pound increase, while others saw a case for no QE at all. There was little market reaction to Thursday\\'s decision, and most economists now doubt that there will be further QE in May unless there is a sharp worsening in the euro zone debt crisis. \"We expect the BoE to refrain from further asset purchases and to shift into a wait-and-see mode ... based on our view that the economic recovery should have gained some traction by May,\" said ABN Amro economist Joost Beaumont. How the MPC\\'s debate panned out this month will become clear on March 21, when the BoE releases minutes of their two-day meeting. Finance minister George Osborne will present his 2012 budget, in which he is under pressure to find ways to boost sluggish growth, the same day. However, Britain\\'s coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats cannot engage in any significant spending measures due to a commitment to largely eliminate the country\\'s hefty budget deficit before a national election in May 2015. Part of Osborne\\'s plans involve \\'credit easing\\' measures to boost the flow of lending to smaller firms. BoE Governor Mervyn King has strongly resisted expanding the central bank\\'s remit beyond buying gilts and a token sum of corporate bonds, saying it is the job of government and commercial banks to make more fine-grained decisions about which sectors firms should get scarce credit. The BoE has forecast a choppy recovery this year, with growth likely to be distorted by an extra public holiday to mark Queen Elizabeth\\'s Diamond Jubilee as well as an influx of tourists for the London Olympics. Business activity surveys have softened slightly from January\\'s relatively strong readings, and oil prices have surged - a double-edged sword that may push up inflation in the short-term, but weaken medium-term growth. With inflation still well above target at 3.6 percent, the record high just hit by British petrol prices may make more hawkish policymakers nervous about the central bank\\'s forecast that inflation will be below 2 percent by the end of the year. March\\'s policy decision marks the third anniversary of the BoE\\'s decision at the depths of the financial crisis in 2009 to cut interest rates to a record-low 0.5 percent and start buying financial market assets with newly created money.

      "{'text': ' General Motors Co chief executive Dan Akerson said it may be two years before its European division is back in profit as the continent sheds over-capacity the same way the U.S. industry had to over the past half decade. \\n The world\\'s largest automaker has lost money in Europe for the last 12 years. \"I think it\\'ll be a good year or two before we can achieve profitability in Europe again,\" Akerson said at an on-stage interview conducted in San Francisco on Wednesday night. European sales had been recovering before the continent became gripped by fears of debt defaults in the middle of last year, Akerson said at the Commonwealth Club of California, a non-profit public affairs forum. \"People stopped buying. I can see it every day in the sales reports,\" said Akerson, who was born in California and studied at the London School of Economics. Industry-wide, Akerson believed there were between seven and 10 excess car plants in Europe and other executives estimate there is 20 percent over-capacity there. He emphasized that a deal with France\\'s PSA Peugeot Citroen announced last week was merely an alliance and that each carmaker had its own problems to solve. GM announced last week that it would halt production of the Chevy Volt plug-in electric car for five weeks and temporarily lay off 1,300 U.S. workers. But Akerson, arguing that a two-week production shutdown last year for its popular Cruze compact car did not generate as much concern, dismissed the worries surrounding the Volt as political. \"Sometimes I feel bad for President Obama,\" Akerson told reporters, saying the Volt was in the works long before Obama\\'s election, yet it was seen as his car due to the government\\'s 27 percent stake in GM after its bailout. \"It\\'s not the Obama car.\" Akerson had said earlier that, while it was not up to him, his ideal outcome would be for the government to, for example, sell off the stake steadily over 10 quarters because he believed uncertainty about it was weighing on GM\\'s share price. Obama\\'s re-election campaign often touts the auto sector bailout as one of the Democrat\\'s major accomplishments as president, seeking to draw a contrast with Republican White House contender Mitt Romney, who opposed it. The Obama administration has backed more than $2 billion to support the development of battery systems designed for electric cars including the $40,000 Volt. Volt owners are also eligible for a $7,500 tax credit for buying the fuel-efficient vehicle. GM is adjusting the Volt to meet strict California requirements for a further $1,500 state rebate and allow drivers to use special carpool lanes in the state, where a fourth of the 7,671 Volts GM sold in 2011 were purchased.

The agreement was struck during Roesler\\'s visit to Greece as head of a 70-strong delegation of German industry representatives seeking business in the country. \"The aid has hardly been accepted, a lot has been in vain so far, it is very disillusioning,\" Roesler told the Saarbruecker Zeitung. The newspaper quoted a ministry progress report on the deal, which read: \"The implementation clearly is not a priority on the Greek side.\" Companies wanting to invest in Greece have met with hurdles such as a multitude of approval procedures and unclear responsibility, according to the ministry. \"It is not failing due to a lack of will, the fundamental problem are the structures,\" Roesler told the paper. Roesler said he was also disappointed that some German companies which had previously done business with Greece had still not been paid. \"The Greek side said during my visit that it would soon resolve the old cases,\" he said. \"Unfortunately there has been hardly any progress on this.\" Germany has a big stake in the debt-stricken Greek economy. Athens has been one of the biggest buyers of German armaments over the past decade and German companies manage some of Greece\\'s largest firms, including Athens International Airport, managed by engineering firm Hochtief. Greece\\'s cash-strapped hospitals owe dozens of millions of euros in arrears to German drugmakers and health equipment providers, such as Bayer. Roesler urged the Greek government to do what was necessary to ensure it could return to growth. Athens needed to create the necessary conditions for growth, by modernizing the administration, opening up its markets and implementing its privatization programme, he said. \"Only when these steps have been seriously implemented will the willingness to invest increase,\" he said. Greece, unable to borrow normally on the bond markets, urgently needs a bailout agreed last month to keep paying its bills while it attempts to make deep structural reforms to its shattered economy, now in the fifth year of deep recession. Euro zone finance ministers are due to decide whether to release the 130 billion euros ($170.57 billion) package during a conference call on Friday but they have already approved the bailout, subject to a private sector creditor agreement slated to go through later on Thursday.

The infringement claims center on a Kodak patent that lets consumers preview digital photographs on LCD screens. Judge Gropper also denied Apple\\'s request to file a new patent infringement lawsuit against Kodak over printer and digital camera patents. A Kodak spokeswoman said the company was \"pleased\" with the judge\\'s ruling. Apple in February had asked the court for permission to lift a stay freezing a patent lawsuit pending in a federal court in Kodak\\'s hometown of Rochester, New York. Apple had hoped to move the case to Manhattan for a jury trial. But while Gropper denied that request, he agreed that the case needs to be resolved sooner rather than later, and in a way that does not interfere with Kodak\\'s ongoing plans to sell its patent portfolio and emerge from bankruptcy. \"I would request that the parties report to me on their efforts to come up with a procedure that truly works,\" he said. Kodak had accused Apple of trying to slow the patent sale process, which it must undertake by the end of June under the terms of a $950 million loan keeping it afloat through bankruptcy. Apple had also sought to bring new patent infringement claims against Kodak, but Gropper nixed that effort under a federal rule designed to shield bankrupt entities from litigation that might constitute \"creditor harassment.\" Apple had argued that patent litigation has been a major part of Kodak\\'s strategy. \"I\\'m sure they have no problem moving ahead with the lawsuits where they\\'re the complainants,\" Apple lawyer David Seligman told the judge.

The report showed the ratio of U.S. household debt to after-tax income fell in the fourth quarter to the lowest level since 2004. Total household liabilities were 117.5 percent of disposable income during the October-December period, down from 118.2 percent in the previous quarter, according to Reuters\\' calculations based on the Fed\\'s \"Flow of Funds\" report.

Stanford was convicted on Tuesday in federal court in Houston of running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. During a six-week trial, prosecutors said Stanford stole the deposits of investors in Stanford International Bank in Antigua to fund a lavish lifestyle of girlfriends, mansions, private jets and yachts. The same court then considered whether funds held in 29 accounts in Canada, Switzerland, Britain and other countries should be forfeited. The accounts are mainly in the name of Stanford International Bank, which Stanford owned, and in the name of Stanford himself. One of the accounts, called \"Baby Mama,\" was in the name of Rebecca Reeves-Stanford, the mother of two of Stanford\\'s children. During the forfeiture proceedings, prosecutors said they traced the money in the accounts back to deposits in Stanford International Bank. But Stanford\\'s defense lawyers said the former financier\\'s business was viable until the government shut it down and seized its U.S. assets in February of 2009. SOMBER Stanford looked somber as the jury delivered its forfeiture verdict. He shook his head repeatedly as U.S. District Judge David Hittner thanked the attorneys for presenting what he called an academically rigorous case over the past six weeks. Robert Scardino, one of Stanford\\'s lawyers, said afterward that he would consider appealing a ruling by Hittner in December that Stanford was competent to be tried. \"Our client spent almost nine months in a mental facility in North Carolina before trial,\" he said. \"We had 30 days with a competent client.\" While awaiting trial, Stanford suffered a brain injury in a fight with another inmate. He then became addicted to an anti-anxiety medication. The combination left him without memory of events before the fight, making him unable to help with his defense, his lawyers said Thursday\\'s verdict kicks off what is likely to be a long process for investors hoping to recover lost money. Receiver Ralph Janvey is pursuing funds for investors in the United States. There are also two receivers in Antigua who are pursuing the same foreign bank accounts that the U.S. government would like to seize. Janvey has just $113 million cash on hand, so the $330 million in foreign accounts could be the largest pool available to Stanford investors. \"We\\'re all pretty devastated as a family,\" Stanford\\'s mother, Sammie Stanford, told reporters on Thursday. She and one of Stanford\\'s daughters later left the court, carrying the suits and shirts Stanford wore during the trial. The case is USA v.

After converting existing accounts in 24 Western states last year, the San Francisco-based bank is working on accounts in Eastern states, where it gained its first branches through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia Corp. Accounts in its remaining East coast states will eventually be converted, spokeswoman Richele Messick said. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, began notifying customers in the six states of the change this week. The fee will appear in June bank statements. Customers can get a $2 discount by eschewing paper statements. In recent years, banks have been doing away with free checking accounts as new regulations curb fees on overdrafts and other charges. Banks typically charge customers monthly fees, unless they choose to do more business with the bank. Wells Fargo ended free checking for new customers in July 2010. It expects 80 percent of its customers to waive monthly maintenance fees by keeping minimum balances and taking other actions. The Essential account is not available to new customers, who must pay $5 per month for a basic account, unless they keep a $1,500 minimum daily balance or have a direct monthly deposit of at least $250 in one lump sum. This year, Wells Fargo also eliminated one of the ways customers could avoid monthly maintenance fees on its premium $10- and $15-per month accounts. Customers can no longer waive this fee by setting up a monthly automatic transfer to a savings account. Messick, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said the bank wants customers to contact it. \"We can talk to them about their needs and make sure they are in the right accounts,\" she said.

      "{'text': ' The European Central Bank signaled its policy course was slowly turning on Thursday, delivering a surprise warning on inflation and calling governments and banks to build on its recent blitz of radical support measures to foster a full crisis recovery. \\n The ECB kept interest rates at a record of low of 1 percent for a third month running as expected, after completing two monster injections of cheap cash which have flushed over a trillion euros of three-year money into the euro zone. Despite lowering its euro zone growth forecasts, it strengthened its rhetoric about a euro zone recovery, saying there were signs of a pick up, rather than the phrase \"tentative signs\" it has used since the start of the year. The central bank also raised its forecasts for inflation this year, partly because of climbing oil prices. \"At least for the time being, a rate cut is clearly off the table ... they took away the easing bias,\" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. \"They sounded a bit more positive but staff projections were worse ... at least the chance of the euro zone falling off the cliff is very low right now.\" ECB President Mario Draghi left little doubt that unless there was a relapse in the debt crisis, the bank had now done all it planned to in terms of extraordinary measures and that governments and banks needed to take up the baton. \"Both LTROs (3-year loan injections) have had such a powerful effect ... we have to see exactly how the financial landscape has changed as a result,\" Draghi told the post meeting news conference. \"I think the ball is in the governments\\' and the other actors\\' - especially banks - court to continue their reforms, to repair their balance sheets so that they can actually support the - especially banks now - support the recovery.\" MIXED FORECASTS The ECB\\'s staff forecasts showed the euro zone economy could shrink by 0.5 percent this year and at best grow by a meager 0.3 percent, a slight downgrade of its previous estimate but more upbeat than most private sector forecasts. \"Available survey indicators confirm signs of a stabilization in the euro area economy. However, the economic outlook is still subject to downside risks,\" Draghi said. Meanwhile, a recent 20 percent rise in oil prices is rekindling inflation to some extent. It is now forecast to be higher, at between 2.1 and 2.7 percent this year, well above the ECB\\'s target of close to but below two percent. \"Owing to rises in energy prices and indirect taxes, inflation rates are now likely to stay above 2 percent in 2012, with upside risks prevailing,\" Draghi said, the first words of warning on inflation for well over half a year. The latest Reuters poll of 74 economists taken before the meeting showed the general view was that the ECB will hold rates at 1.0 percent until well into 2013. The euro spiked after the warning on inflation although it settled lower again after the bank cut its growth forecasts. SWEETNESS AND LIGHT Draghi was in no doubt that the ECB\\'s twin three-year funding operations, which pumped over 1 trillion euros into the euro zone banking system, had saved the currency bloc from a serious crisis. Borrowing costs for debt strugglers such as Italy and Spain have tumbled as a result and Draghi said markets, including the interbank lending market, had reopened and \"real money\" investors were returning to euro assets. \"All in all, we see that great progress has been achieved,\" he said. \"Simply compare what the situation was in November last year and what it is today.\" While the euro zone economy has stabilized over recent months, in part thanks to the ECB\\'s back-to-back rate cuts in November and December and the twin funding operations, there are growing signs of disquiet among some at the bank. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann aired his concerns in a letter to Draghi last month. Juergen Stark, the ECB\\'s influential former head of economics, added his criticism by telling a German newspaper on Thursday that the quality of the central bank\\'s balance sheet was now \"shocking\". Stark was one of two German members of the ECB policymaking fraternity who quit last year in protest at policies they felt overstepped the central bank\\'s remit. Draghi denied there was any split this time, singling out Weidmann. \"My personal relationship with Jens is excellent ... Nobody is isolated in the Governing Council and especially the Bundesbank is not isolated,\" he said. \"I really cherish the culture and the tradition of the Bundesbank.\" In his letter, which was leaked on the day of the ECB\\'s second dose of three-year funds, Weidmann wrote about the imbalances in the euro zone\\'s payment system, TARGET2, and the resulting risks for the Bundesbank, which would be exposed in the unlikely event of the euro zone breaking up. Draghi played down those concerns. \"The balance sheets of the other major central banks have expanded in a short period of time much more than the ECB\\'s,\" he said. \"So at the present time, to say that the risks for the ECB balance sheet are now higher than what they are in the Fed and in Bank of England is not correct.\" (Writing by  Marc Jones  and Mike Peacock.

      "{'text': ' The man who has paid out billions of dollars to victims of the massive 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill has been formally relieved of his duties, and a federal judge has set up a new process to let more people and businesses collect some of their money immediately. \\n Thursday\\'s order by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans follows a March 2 agreement in principle for BP Plc ( BP.L ) to pay claims by a group of plaintiffs estimated to total more than 100,000, at a cost of about $7.8 billion. The order calls for a new administrator to handle claims from the $20 billion Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF), replacing the lawyer Kenneth Feinberg. That fund had been set up to compensate fishermen, hotel owners, property owners and others for losses from the April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and subsequent oil spill. The disaster killed 11 people and unleashed an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Feinberg, who oversaw a compensation fund for victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, has received about 1.06 million claims from roughly 574,000 claimants under the GCCF, and paid out about $6.1 billion to roughly 221,000 claimants. He could not immediately be reached for comment. According to Thursday\\'s order, claimants with final offers from Feinberg can recover 60 percent of their money immediately. If they are deemed eligible under the new program, then they may receive the remaining 40 percent or wait for new awards, which may be higher but take months to determine. Until the new program is set up, claims will be reviewed during a transition period, and successful claimants can also get 60 percent of their money. Remaining claims would be determined entirely under the new program. Lawyers on the Plaintiffs\\' Steering Committee, which negotiated the settlement with BP, have said the new program will be fair and transparent, although some lawyers outside that process have questioned whether it will be an improvement. \"In the new deal, God knows when you\\'re going to get your money,\" said Daniel Becnel, a Louisiana lawyer who has many clients that have been processing claims through the GCCF. \"You don\\'t know what to tell your client.\" A spokesman for the PSC declined to comment. Lynn Greer, a Richmond, Virginia, lawyer, will coordinate claims during the transition period. Patrick Juneau, a lawyer in Lafayette, Louisiana, will administer claims during that period and would continue in that role under the proposed court-supervised program. Through March 7, about 41 percent of the $6.1 billion GCCF payout has gone to people and businesses in Florida. Another 29 percent has gone to Louisiana, 16 percent to Alabama, 7 percent to Mississippi, 4 percent to Texas and the remainder elsewhere. By industry, retail and other services; food, beverages and lodging; and fishing and seafood processing have comprised the bulk of the allowed claims. BP said it has already paid out more than $8 billion to claimants. It still faces claims by the U.S. Department of Justice, Gulf Coast states, and its drilling partners Transocean Ltd ( RIGN.VX ) and Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) over the spill.

      "{'text': ' The deadly start to the 2012 tornado season is forcing insurers to reconsider the risks of coverage in the most storm-prone parts of the United States and industry insiders say they may have to rethink how they handle the underwriting of the reoccurring natural disasters. \\n Unfortunately, homeowners may find themselves either paying substantially higher rates or not having insurance at all, as insurers try to manage their exposure to what is clearly a growing concern by diversifying geographically and tightening their standards. The U.S. insurance industry lost nearly $26 billion on tornadoes and related storms in 2011, higher than the previous record, and insurers have already lost as much as $2 billion this year. But that total is still 50 percent less than what Hurricane Katrina cost the industry in 2005. Still, more bad news could be on the horizon as the bulk of last year\\'s losses came in April and May, and the peak of tornado season runs through July. Disaster modeler Eqecat said the total number of tornadoes recorded this year to date is more than twice the seven-year average. It was Eqecat that estimated industry losses from last week\\'s storms at $1 billion to $2 billion. \"While it\\'s not to the same scale as what a major hurricane could do to a Florida or the Eastern coastal states, I think the risk of severe thunderstorms is growing and awareness is growing,\" said Brad Lemons, vice president of product and pricing at Nationwide Mutual NMUIC.UL, the eighth-largest property insurer in the country. Nationwide Insurance, as with others in the industry, is trying a mix of different things like diversifying geographically to moderate its exposure to the most risky locations, tightening underwriting standards and charging more where it can. PAYING THE COST Homeowners in hard-hit states are already paying the cost this year. For example, State Farm, the country\\'s largest home and auto insurer, received approval from regulators for a 5 percent hike in owner-occupied homeowners insurance rates in Alabama as of last November. In Mississippi, it sought a 15.8 percent rate hike for its manufactured housing coverage. Those rate rises are small in comparison to what people in Louisiana and Florida experienced post-Katrina where many people were paying double within three years. The tornadoes on Friday generated another 6,300 claims for State Farm in just the first day after impact. In a statement, State Farm said its response to risk is considered over time and not based on any one event, much like other insurers who say recent rate hikes are more about planning for the future than recovering past losses. \"While recent claims experience is often an indicator of future claims experience, catastrophe claims experience tends to be aberrational. We evaluate catastrophe claims experience over longer periods of time than we do other types of claims experience,\" the company said. The Consumer Federation of America, in a February study written by a former Texas insurance commissioner, claimed homeowners were paying 10 times more out of pocket for damage after Katrina than after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and rates have rose further since that time. It is not just homeowners, though; car owners are also feeling the pain. In tornado-hit states, new research suggests catastrophe losses are contributing directly to higher costs, even in the highly competitive world of auto insurance. \"The more we\\'ve seen tornadoes hit the Midwest, it would be a factor there,\" said Amy Danise, editorial director of Insure.com, which does comparisons on state-by-state auto insurance rates. \"When you\\'re seeing these storms sweep through multiple times in one season, that\\'s where you\\'ll definitely see a correlation.\" Insure.com\\'s survey, looking at rates from six of the largest carriers in the country, found that storm-prone states like Louisiana and Oklahoma top the list, while rates in places like Wisconsin and Maine can be as much as two-thirds less. CHANGING STANDARDS The phrase \"perfect storm\" is overused, but in last Friday\\'s case, it might well be true. \"Nearly every factor meteorologists look for when forecasting severe thunderstorms and tornadoes was in place,\" AccuWeather said in a report Monday. Given how frequent twisters have become in the last year or so, one solution for the industry is to simply get out of the storms\\' way. While it is rare for an insurer to go out of business or fail outright -- 23 property and casualty insurers failed from 2008 to 2011, according to the National Conference of Insurance Guaranty Funds. Last May, Alfa Mutual stopped writing policies on older Alabama homes in the face of tornado losses. For larger insurers wary of a similar fate, that means not putting all of their eggs in one regional basket. \"As the severity of a tornado increases, as you get up to an F5, it\\'s less about the quality of risk actually and more about the quantity of risk,\" said Erik Nikodem, a senior vice president of the AIG ( AIG.N ) unit Lexington Insurance. \"We\\'re paying a lot of attention to the amount of the risk that we have and the aggregation of the risk in a geographic concentration.\" It also means making changes in how risks are assessed and how policies are written. Travelers ( TRV.N ), a top-10 property insurer, said in late January it is continuing to push underwriting changes to improve its profitability. \"(We) are underwriting for age and quality of roof, reassessing how we factor in the number and type of previous claims, and implementing higher minimum deductibles for weather and non-weather claims,\" CEO Jay Fishman said on a conference call with analysts.

Walker on leave, after prosecutors said a 44-year-old mother of four accused of running a brothel had visited the firm to discuss an online prostitution venture. \\n Manhattan prosecutors arrested Anna Gristina of Monroe, New York, on February 22 on charges of promoting prostitution. She pleaded not guilty. During her February 23 arraignment, prosecutors said she was arrested after meeting a Morgan Stanley employee at one of the firm\\'s Manhattan offices to discuss an online venture for matching male clients with female prostitutes. Walker, a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney broker, is that employee, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that he had been placed on administrative leave until an investigation was completed. Morgan Stanley declined further comment. The source familiar with the matter said on Thursday that Walker has denied any involvement in any illegal activity. An internal Morgan Stanley probe has so far found no evidence to the contrary, nor has the firm found any evidence of involvement by other employees, the source said. Walker has not been charged with any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, Walker told a local news website, DNAinfo.com, that Gristina had \"many other connections\" at Morgan Stanley. Walker could not be reached for comment at his Morgan Stanley office. Gristina\\'s lawyer, Peter Gleason, could not be reached for comment. During Gristina\\'s arraignment, New York Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan told a Manhattan Criminal Court judge that \"she had been at the Morgan Stanley banker\\'s office for a meeting in which she was trying to solicit money to fund what we believe is another illicit venture on the Internet that involves matching male clients with female prostitutes.\" Morgan Stanley searched its visitor records looking for the employee who had met with Gristina. The source said the investment bank learned of Walker\\'s involvement with Gristina on Wednesday. Prosecutor Linehan said at the arraignment that Gristina\\'s indictment stemmed from a five-year investigation involving hundreds of hours of surveillance of her and her associates and 50 to 100 hours of audio and video recordings. Gristina was charged with third-degree promotion of prostitution. She is due back in court May 3 and could face up to seven years in prison if convicted. The news came a week after another Morgan Stanley employee, investment banker William Bryan Jennings, was arrested by police in Darien, Connecticut, on charges he stabbed a New York taxi driver on December 22. Police said Jennings made racial slurs against the Egyptian-born driver. Regulatory records show that Walker has been a broker since 1988 and that he was an employee of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney or its predecessor firms since 1999. Walker spent the early part of his career at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney before joining Merrill Lynch in 1994, according to Walker\\'s FINRA records. He jumped to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in 1999, joined Citigroup\\'s ( C.N ) Smith Barney in 2005, but ended up back at Morgan Stanley when the investment bank acquired control of Smith Barney in 2009. The FINRA records show he was involved in one customer dispute, a 2004 \"account mismanagement\" complaint with no specified damages that was denied by arbitrators. (Reporting By Joseph A.

Beal & Co, and Chicago-based Loop Capital Markets. \"Wall Street tries to do what looks good on high-profile IPOs, and it will not go unnoticed that Facebook has chosen to bring in minority underwriters,\" said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique. \"It\\'s not going to make or break the deal, but it will show that they\\'re not nonchalant about the opportunities that smaller firms can offer distribution-wise.\" Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. The addition of these firms comes after Facebook was criticized by the California State Teachers\\' Retirement System for not including women on its board of directors. CalSTRS, the second largest pension fund in the United States, holds some ownership in Facebook and expects to be a public shareholder. In Facebook and other IPOs, these firms are only getting joint bookrunner positions, with the large Wall Street banks taking the lead spots. Women- and minority-owned investment banks have been underwriting more equity deals in recent years. They helped underwrite 20 IPOs in 2011 that raised $1.5 billion, almost double the amount raised in 2007, according to data from Thomson Reuters. In 2010 Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, spoke out against General Motors\\' decision not to include any underwriters from minority- or women-owned financial institutions. The Detroit automaker eventually added a handful of these banks as underwriters. Goldman Sachs also gave boutique firms Utendahl Capital Partners and Muriel Siebert & Co a more lucrative position in its IPO after discussions with civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson, according to a 1999 report from the Associated Press. Jackson had been pushing for minority businesses to have more of a presence on Wall Street. Goldman declined to comment.

It was sold to television network CBS in 1965. When CBS started selling off its non-media businesses, then Fender Chief Executive William Schultz teamed up with some of the company\\'s international distributors and bought out Fender in 1984. Schultz and his family trust still own about 6 percent of Scottsdale, Arizona-based Fender, according to the company\\'s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Private equity firm Weston Presidio owns a 43 percent stake. \"Fender is using a window of opportunity here to get into portfolios of funds that look for strong brands,\" Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based IPO investment firm IPOX Schuster, told Reuters. \"It is a leader in its field. I think there will be demand for its stock.\" J.P. Morgan, Baird, Stifel Nicolaus Weisel and Wells Fargo Securities would be underwriting the offering, Fender said in the filing. The company plans to use about $100 million of the proceeds to pay off debt. Since part of the debt repayment will be made to some of the banks underwriting the offering, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulations require the offering to have a qualified independent underwriter, the filing said. William Blair & Company would act as the independent underwriter in the offering. The number of shares to be offered -- a portion of which will be sold by some stockholders -- and the price range for the offering have not yet been determined, Fender said. The company, which had net sales of $700.6 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, said it plans to apply to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"FNDR.\" The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees.

BONDHOLDERS WHO SAY THEY WILL ACCEPT: A total of 32 companies, who are members of bank lobby the IIF, which negotiated on their behalf said they will accept the offer. They hold 84 billion euros of Greek debt. Three other Greek banks holding 11 bln euros worth of bonds will participate. Greek social security funds and other state organizations - holding about 23 billion euros of the bonds, most managed by the country's central bank -- have signed up. German banks, who hold at least 8 billion euros of Greek bonds, will accept the deal, sources said. The same goes for Portuguese and Austrian banks holding a little more than 1 billion euros. CREDITORS WHO MAY HOLD OUT: While most Greek pension funds holding Greek sovereign debt have agreed to take part, six have refused to do so having come under pressure from workers' unions worried the writedown on Greek debt holdings will affect the viability of their funds. Investors in a Swiss-law governed Greek government bond who hold a chunk of its 650 million Swiss francs ($707 million) have teamed up to challenge the terms of Athens' proposed bond swap. Some hedge funds are refusing to join Greece's bond swap, threatening legal action if the government does not come up with a better offer, which could drag the Greek government into a legal battle, although they are unlikely to be able to derail the deal.

      "{'text': ' JPMorgan Securities, the brokerage arm of banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), is trying to lure advisers from Wall Street rivals with an unlikely pitch: \"We\\'re actually a small boutique.\" \\n Advising individual investors with stock brokers is a new addition to the wealth management business of JPMorgan, already one of the world\\'s largest private bankers to the ultra-rich. The push makes the company a big competitor for the same top advisers coveted by Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Bank of America Corp\\'s ( BAC.N ) Merrill Lynch and UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ). About 200 brokers from those firms, as well as Barclays Plc\\'s ( BARC.L ) Barclays Wealth, Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and others, have joined JPMorgan Securities in the three years since JPMorgan took over Bear Stearns and inherited a private-client business catering to well-heeled clients. The unit ended 2011 with 439 advisers. It expects to add up to 75 this year and reach 650 over the next four years, Chief Executive Officer Greg Quental said in an interview. \"We\\'re seeing interest from advisers across a range of organizations,\" said Quental, noting that recent struggles at rival firms have created an opportunity to recruit and expand. BOUTIQUE PITCH Competition for top brokers is fiercer than ever, as almost every large bank wants to attract wealthy American customers. As a newcomer to this corner of the market, JPMorgan is selling itself as the best of both worlds. \"We\\'re a boutique plugged into a massive financial institution,\" said Quental, a former Bear Stearns strategy executive who became JPMorgan Securities\\' CEO in August 2010. Claiming to be small may seem quite a stretch for a bank that is the largest in the United States by assets and employs 260,000 people -- roughly the population of Buffalo, New York. JPMorgan is also one of the country\\'s largest mortgage, credit card and consumer lenders. But when it comes to the brokerage, Quental says JPMorgan Securities has just three layers: brokers, branch managers and himself. Rivals may have division, regional and branch-complex managers between brokers and the top boss. And even if it reaches its long-term goal of 1,000 brokers, JPMorgan Securities would still be tiny compared with Merrill\\'s 16,100 advisers and Morgan Stanley\\'s 17,600. The unit\\'s finances have not been disclosed since 2009, when 376 brokers generated $419 million in revenue. Assuming no change in average production, JPMorgan brokers last year would have generated revenue of $490 million -- a rounding error at a bank that generated $100 billion. JPMorgan brokers are among the most productive on Wall Street, Quental said, generating revenue at an average of more than $1.1 million each last year. By comparison, UBS advisers averaged $870,000, the highest among the largest U.S. brokerage firms. Recruiters, citing advisers they have placed, say JPMorgan Securities has maintained Bear\\'s high-end strategy and small-firm intimacy. Of course, emphasizing \"small\" is popular in the wealth management business these days. That appeals not only to advisers, but also to investors who want personalized service. Other big finance companies have created small, specialized units when they set out to attract elite investors. Merrill Lynch has its Private Banking and Investment Group, while UBS and Morgan Stanley have formed \"private wealth management\" arms. THREE WEALTH UNITS But with the brokerage, JPMorgan now has three businesses selling wealth management services: Its private bank caters to families with more than $25 million to invest, while JPMorgan Private Wealth Management requires at least $5 million. Private banks typically provide estate and tax planning, loans and a range of traditional and alternative investments. They deploy teams of specialists led by an account manager. In contrast, JPMorgan Securities is a traditional brokerage that trades stocks, bonds and other investments on commission, although it also manages portfolios for a fee. There is no minimum account size. Clients choose which unit of the bank they want to do business with, Quental said, and there is no requirement within JPMorgan Securities to ship accounts up to the private bank. \"We recognize there are clients who prefer to work with a private bank or have financial needs that are most appropriately served by a private banking model,\" he said. JPMorgan Securities has had losses, to be sure: About 100 brokers retired or moved to other firms since 2008. The biggest departure was New York broker Richard Saperstein, who in 2009 took a $10 billion book of business to HighTower Advisors. BROKER MOVEMENT The small-firm pitch will appeal to brokers at big banks, many of whom are reassessing which company they want on their business cards, Quental said. For example, the 2009 merger of Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney continues to generate integration problems and a clash of cultures, and advisers at Merrill Lynch have been vexed by management changes and Bank of America\\'s credit woes. While Merrill brokers also say they feel pressured to sell Bank of America loans and banking products, JPMorgan Securities advisers appear to have few complaints about interaction with the parent\\'s myriad businesses, according to recruiters. \"The question is always: \\'Where does the bank end and the brokerage begin?\\'\" said veteran New York broker recruiter Michael Kelly. \"We\\'re told (JPMorgan Chase CEO) Jamie Dimon is very supportive of the division and gives it lots of flexibility.\" Recruiters say a significant number of brokers tied down by crisis-era retention packages will be considering a move as those binds start to loosen this year. JPMorgan Securities generally pays recruits a bonus of about double their trailing-year fees and commissions, a veteran recruiter said, compared with 330 percent top-of-the-market deals dangled by the big Wall Street houses. That means a broker generating $2 million in revenue could leave $2.6 million on the table by choosing JPMorgan. Quental says recruits will accept less money up front in exchange for the stability and reputation of the company, as well as the opportunity to build up their practices. Scale and the capabilities it brings are an equally important part of the pitch. Over the past year, the company has upgraded technology and forged closer ties with the rest of its investment banking and consumer businesses. The unit plans to install $250 million worth of adviser workstations and build a $40 million online services platform, he said. JPMorgan Securities also offers some of the hedge funds and specialized loans available though JPMorgan Private Bank. \"Boutiques don\\'t have those kinds of capabilities,\" Quental said. Broker Mark Glasser, who joined JPMorgan Securities in New York in September from Barclays Wealth, said his new employer gives him access to global investment research that he finds invaluable as he advises 15 families whose assets range from $10 million to \"several hundred million\" dollars. The former Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley adviser also values the financial strength of parent bank JPMorgan, as well as his access to senior management. \"It\\'s easy to get lost in a firm with thousands and thousands of brokers,\" Glasser said.

The plan by India\\'s Department of Information Technology\\'s also covers \"products that have undefined \\'security implications\\'\" and potentially software, the groups said. \"Most troubling, however, are the (Indian government\\'s) plans to use its regulatory power to force government licensees to purchase domestic electronic products in a manner clearly inconsistent with the letter and spirit of India\\'s WTO (World Trade Organization) commitments,\" they said in the letter. They appealed for Kirk\\'s urgent assistance in addressing a development that could have a \"devastating\" impact on U.S. companies\\' competitive stance in a key market in India and damage U.S.-India trade. A copy was also sent to Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and Commerce Secretary John Bryson, who is leading a trade mission to India later this month to explore opportunities for U.S. companies to take part in infrastructure projects. The United States has run increasingly large trade deficits in advanced technology products in recent years, unlike the surpluses that were typical in the 1990s. Last year, the advanced technology trade gap was $99.3 billion. While India is a growing market for variety of U.S. exports, imports from the sub-continent have grown even faster. The U.S. trade deficit with India hit $14.54 billion in 2011, as exports rose to $21.63 billion and imports to $36.17 billion. The coalition released the letter a day after the Obama administration filed a WTO case against India for its ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat, eggs and other farm products. The United States says the ban, which India says is needed to stop the spread of bird flu, is not based on sound science. More than 100 countries currently import U.S. poultry.

      "{'text': ' U.S. Senate Democrats on Thursday defeated a Republican proposal to take quick action on the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, in a vote that will give Republicans more ammunition to criticize President Barack Obama\\'s energy policies on the campaign trail. \\n TransCanada\\'s $7 billion project has been supported by some Democrats in the past, but Obama took the unusual step of calling some senators personally and asking them to vote against the proposal, drawing immediate fire from Republican leaders. The measure needed 60 votes to pass, but fell four short. Obama put the project on hold earlier this year pending further environmental review. Republicans argue the pipeline, which would ship oil from Canada and northern U.S. states to Texas, would create jobs and improve energy security at a time of surging gasoline prices. The project will take more than two years to build after winning all approvals. By proposing the amendment, Republicans sought to wrest the approval process from Obama\\'s control. They have also used the proposal to highlight his decision ahead of November presidential and congressional elections, linking his delaying of the pipeline project to rising gasoline prices. \"At a moment when millions are out of work, gas prices are sky-rocketing and the Middle East is in turmoil, we\\'ve got a president who\\'s up making phone calls trying to block a pipeline here at home. It\\'s unbelievable,\" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Obama has supported construction of the southern leg of the pipeline, and his administration will assess a new route around an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska once it has been identified, White House spokesman Clark Stevens said. \"Once again, Republicans are trying to play politics with a pipeline project whose route has yet to be proposed,\" Stevens said. The Keystone amendment was among 30 measures - many of them energy-related - being voted on as the Senate pushes in coming days to renew funding for highways and other infrastructure projects, slated to run out at the end of March. Earlier, the Senate also defeated proposals to expand the area available for offshore oil drilling and extend the time for manufacturers to phase in new pollution regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency for industrial boilers. But the Keystone amendment attracted the most attention. The pipeline would carry crude from Canadian oil sands to Texas refineries and would also pick up U.S. crude from North Dakota and Montana along the way. With a 34-64 vote, senators also defeated a proposal from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden that would have blocked exports of oil from the pipeline, as well as refined products made from the oil. Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota, who had championed the Republican plan to advance the pipeline, said the restrictions in the Democratic alternative would have blocked the project.

      "{'text': ' President Barack Obama summons the image of a scrappy auto worker or high-tech engineer when he calls for expanding a major corporate tax break for manufacturing, but he might just as well evoke the coffee-shop barista or the cable guy. \\n Broadening the $18 billion-a-year deduction for American manufacturing is a cornerstone of Obama\\'s plan to revamp corporate taxes. Under the plan, all corporations would be subject to much lower tax rates, with even bigger breaks for manufacturers. A Reuters analysis of company filings and government data shows how broadly the deduction is now used, suggesting it may be nearly impossible to keep it focused on manufacturing. Corporate America\\'s army of tax lawyers will be at the ready. From Starbucks Corp to Time Warner Cable Inc, businesses far beyond traditional manufacturers use the benefit, Reuters found. \"If you are in the Dow Jones industrial (average), and you are not taking this deduction, there must be something wrong,\" said John Harrington, a former U.S. tax official now at law firm SNR Denton. \"It has always applied to a motley crew of activities.\" The deduction has become so deeply embedded in the economy that one-third of corporate activity qualifies for it, the Congressional Research Service said in a report last month. Obama wants to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent, with a special 25 percent rate for manufacturing. At the same time, he wants to double the deduction for \"advanced\" manufacturing, which he has not defined, and cut the break for oil and gas companies. Obama has traveled to Iowa, Wisconsin and other states to tout the tax break, which is known as Section 199. \"In America, there\\'s always something we can do to create new jobs and new manufacturing and new security for the middle class,\" the president said in February. Critics say the manufacturing focus is in large part politics as Obama faces a potentially tough re-election fight in battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, where manufacturing is important. Meanwhile, Congress is unlikely to take any action on the tax breaks until after, perhaps long after, the November 6 vote. STARBUCKS FOOTNOTE Enacted by Congress in 2004 amid concerns about jobs leaving the United States, the tax break began as a 3 percent deduction from income derived from property manufactured, produced, grown or extracted there. Since 2010, most companies have gotten a 9 percent deduction. Pointing to the complexity, a congressional report on the law includes what is known as the \"Starbucks Footnote,\" which states that food processing qualifies, but not retail activities. That said, lawmakers made an exception that allows establishments to allocate a section of gross receipts for the break to the extent that roasted beans are used to brew the coffee. Starbucks, the eponymous coffee giant with nearly $12 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year, takes the deduction. The company said it had helped trim its tax rate by 0.8 percentage point in fiscal year 2011 and cut its 2009 rate by more than 2 points, according to a regulatory filing. Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said the deductions reflected the income from work at the company\\'s four U.S. roasting plants, which employ 800 people, not from brewing espresso at retail stores. Time Warner Cable, with $20 billion in revenue in 2011, reaped a $14 million benefit from the break in 2011, filings at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed. A spokesman declined to comment. Filings show other users of the deduction include satellite TV provider DirecTV, which said the break helped cut its 2011 tax rate, and sports, media and entertainment company Madison Square Garden Co, which said the deduction helped defray fourth-quarter expenses. HAMBURGERS TO MINING Companies classified as manufacturers claimed $12 billion of the $18 billion in Section 199 tax deductions in 2008, the latest year that government data is available. Some critics argue that, on a relative basis, other industries benefit more. The tax break accounts for 0.2 percent of all manufacturing deductions, but it comprises about 0.5 percent of all deductions used by mining companies and 0.7 percent of those used by publishers, according to the data. \"What happens is people game the system,\" said Will McBride, an economist with the conservative Tax Foundation think tank. Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Information Foundation, a think tank funded in part by technology companies, said that even though hamburger makers might benefit, cutting the deduction would harm manufacturers. \"Many of the models that economists use still think we are a closed economy where we don\\'t really compete with other countries,\" he said at a Senate hearing this week. CARVE OUT? It may be impossible to tell how much the benefit preserves U.S. jobs, especially as manufacturing continues to ebb. It will probably drop to 7 percent of the labor market by 2020, down from about a third in the 1950s, according to government forecasts. Obama\\'s Simpson-Bowles commission on cutting the U.S. deficit recommended killing Section 199, the part of the IRS tax code that provides for the tax break. It proposed removing tax breaks while simultaneously lowering rates for all companies. Many tax experts contend that Obama\\'s bid for a special manufacturing carve-out moves in the opposite direction. Lawmakers in Congress now are laying the groundwork for a revamp of the entire tax code, a process expected to take years.

      "{'text': ' Corporate audit giant Ernst & Young <ERNY.UL} operates a lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., that has been hired in recent years by several corporations that were at the same time E&Y audit clients, prompting two senior lawmakers to demand closer regulatory scrutiny. \\n Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ), CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) have ongoing lobbying contracts with Washington Council Ernst & Young, an E&Y unit, while also using the audit firm to review the corporations\\' books, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The same arrangement occurred in the past with E&Y, its lobbying unit and AT&T Inc ( T.N ), Fortress Investment Group LLC ( FIG.N ) and Transocean Ltd ( RIG.N ), records show. Those lobbying contracts ended between 2006 and 2011. U.S. rules on \"auditor independence\" include one that bars auditors from serving in an \"advocacy role\" for audit clients. The rule is focused on legal advocacy, such as providing expert witness testimony, but several accountants said the general prohibition on advocacy may cover lobbying, as well. The rules, which were beefed up nearly a decade ago after the Enron-era accounting scandals, are designed to ensure auditors are impartial when they review clients\\' books. Ernst & Young said Washington Council\\'s work complied with independence rules. It was pre-approved by clients\\' audit committees and it was limited to tax-related issues, E&Y spokesman Charles Perkins said in an e-mailed statement. The firm does not solicit votes on legislation for E&Y audit clients, Perkins said. \"We assist clients in monitoring public policy, analyzing legislation and educating Treasury officials, the IRS, legislators, other policy makers and their staffs about the potential consequences of legislation,\" Perkins said. Accounting experts said the issue may turn on the type of work lobbyists do and whether it crosses a line into advocacy. The market-regulating U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not definitively said when lobbying could compromise an auditor\\'s independence. \"Lobbying members of Congress on behalf of audit clients would make the auditor an advocate for the client,\" said Douglas Carmichael, former chief auditor for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a watchdog panel that regulates the auditing industry. Washington Council Ernst & Young reported taking in $12.2 million in fees from 72 lobbying clients in 2011. The unit\\'s annual fee income has held steady since E&Y acquired the unit in 2000. Its revenue is a tiny fraction of the audit firm\\'s global revenue of $22.9 billion for the year ending June 30, 2011. SENATORS URGE SCRUTINY Democratic Senator Carl Levin, a supporter of stricter auditor independence rules, called for scrutiny by the PCAOB in a statement sent in response to questions from Reuters. \"The PCAOB should look into whether lobbying by an accounting firm -- either directly or through a related entity on behalf of an audit client -- is the type of service that is or should be banned under the auditor independence law,\" he said. Spokespersons for the PCAOB and the SEC, which oversees the PCAOB and appoints its members, both declined to comment on whether the two organizations are looking into the matter. Ernst & Young is one of the Big Four of the global corporate audit industry. The others are Deloitte [DLTE.UL>, KPMG KPMG.UL and PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL}. All monitor legislation for clients, but E&Y alone says that its work includes educating policy-makers on behalf of audit clients. To determine whether E&Y\\'s work counts as \"advocacy,\" the SEC could draw on two definitions of lobbying elsewhere in U.S. law. The Lobbying Disclosure Act says that making contact with government officials counts as lobbying, with some exceptions. It makes no exception for education. The tax code says that activity is not lobbying unless it has the purpose of influencing legislation. Clarification is needed from the SEC, which interprets and enforces the rules, Democratic Senator Jack Reed told Reuters. \"You will get people who will argue that lobbying does involve a degree of advocacy ... and others will say it is just simply factual education,\" Reed, the chairman of a subcommittee with jurisdiction over auditors, said in an interview. \"What is the scope of this advocacy prohibition? ... The only definitive answer will come from the SEC.\" The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires a lobbying firm to notify Congress when a new client hires the firm, if the firm expects to make more than one contact on the client\\'s behalf and to spend 20 percent or more of its time for the client on lobbying activities. Then, a lobbying firm must file disclosure reports every calendar quarter. Those reports detail how much money the firm collected in fees, the issues it worked on, the lobbyists involved and the agencies it contacted. The reports do not say when and where lobbying meetings took place, or the lawmakers or government staff members who attended. AT&T, FORTRESS WERE CLIENTS In 2006, Ernst & Young was registered as a lobbyist for AT&T on corporate and international tax issues. The same year, E&Y audited the giant telecommunications company\\'s books, SEC filings show. An AT&T spokeswoman defended the relationship, saying that Ernst & Young did not act as a lobbyist for the company. The lobbying disclosure reports were \"not actually necessary given the scope of services,\" AT&T spokeswoman McCall Butler said in an e-mailed response to questions. The services were \"limited to information and advisory services regarding legislative and tax issues,\" and AT&T\\'s audit committee approved them, she said. She did not say why E&Y filed the reports if they were unnecessary. Donley Ritchey, who was AT&T\\'s audit committee chairman in 2006, declined to comment and referred questions to AT&T. Lobbying disclosure reports say without elaboration that the AT&T-E&Y relationship ended in October 2006. Ernst & Young was auditor to private-equity firm and asset manager Fortress Investment Group in 2007. In that same year, Fortress paid $340,000 to Washington Council Ernst & Young for tax-related work, according to lobbying disclosure reports. Fortress board member Douglas Jacobs, chairman of the group\\'s audit committee, said the committee approved the hiring of Ernst & Young to monitor developments in Washington. The committee acted appropriately, he said. He said he could not answer questions about the day-to-day details of the Fortress-E&Y relationship. He referred those to Fortress management. A Fortress spokesman declined to comment. Transocean spokesman Guy Cantwell said E&Y monitored tax issues for the offshore drilling rig operator. \"Monitoring and reporting on tax matters are permitted services under the independence rules,\" he said, adding that he did not know whether E&Y was engaged in educating lawmakers. Drugmaker Amgen, pharmacy firm CVS Caremark and phone company Verizon declined to comment. Audit committee chairmen for those companies and Transocean could not be reached. RULES SHIELD INDEPENDENCE Auditor independence rules are meant to prevent auditors from getting too cozy with the management of an audit client. The rules are based on the idea that auditors are watchdogs for investors and should not be promoting management\\'s interests. The SEC has long held that the appearance of independence is as important as being independent in fact. \"The rules say you cannot act as an advocate for an audit client, and what constitutes advocacy really depends on specific facts and circumstances,\" SEC Chief Accountant Jim Kroeker said. \"There are certain types of lobbying that would clearly be advocacy,\" he told Reuters. The SEC requires board audit committees to review non-audit services provided by an auditor to ensure independence is protected. Companies in the past have sought guidance from the SEC to be sure certain activities would not violate the rules. Ernst & Young declined to comment on whether it consulted the SEC before registering as a lobbyist for audit clients, but said it took \"appropriate steps\" to be sure it complied with independence rules. Auditor independence has been under renewed scrutiny since the 2007-2009 credit crisis, when auditors were widely criticized for not flagging risks at major banks and financial firms that failed or had to be propped up with government funds. U.S. and EU regulators are considering sweeping changes designed to ensure auditors are more skeptical. E&Y SUSPENDED IN 2004 Independence is an especially sensitive issue for Ernst & Young, which was suspended in 2004 from accepting new public company audit clients for six months because of alleged violations of independence rules. The suspension stemmed from a joint venture Ernst had in the 1990s with business software provider PeopleSoft, now part of Oracle Corp ORCL.O, when Ernst was also auditing PeopleSoft\\'s books. An SEC administrative law judge ordered Ernst & Young to disgorge $1.7 million in audit fees and issued a cease-and-desist order against future independence violations. Independent lobbying firms that hire out lobbyists to clients are commonplace in Washington, D.C. In 2000, Ernst & Young bought one of them, then known as Washington Counsel, and changed its name to Washington Council Ernst & Young. Deloitte has a legislative affairs group that monitors tax proposals in Washington, but it does not offer lobbying services of any kind, said Deloitte spokeswoman Kathryn Metcalfe. It has no registered lobbying clients. KPMG advertises legislative services such as analysis and briefings on pending bills. The firm has one registered lobbying client, a coalition related to fisheries issues. \"We do only a small amount of tax lobbying for firm clients and it is always disclosed in full compliance with the law,\" KPMG spokesman Jim McGann said. Compared with E&Y, PricewaterhouseCoopers sells lobbying services on a smaller scale. It cut back on the business line in 2002, selling its lobbying arm, Federal Policy Group, as audit firms came under scrutiny for non-audit work. PwC collected $1.8 million from 11 lobbying clients in 2011. Most of them were trade associations and industry coalitions. \"As a matter of firm policy and, in part, due to auditor independence requirements, PwC does not lobby for audit clients,\" said Laura Cox Kaplan, head of government, regulatory affairs and public policy at PricewaterhouseCoopers.

      "{'text': ' Greek unemployment hit another record high in December and for the first time the number of young people without a job outnumbered those in work. \\n Statistics service ELSTAT said on Thursday that the overall jobless rate rose to 21 percent from 20.9 percent in November, twice the euro zone rate. The average unemployment rate for 2011 jumped to 17.3 percent from 12.5 percent in the previous year, according to the figures, which are not adjusted for seasonal factors. Youth were particularly hit. For the first time on record, more people between 15-24 years were without a job than with one. Unemployment in that age group rose to 51.1 percent, twice as high as three years ago. Budget cuts imposed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund as a condition for saving the debt-laden country from a chaotic default have caused a wave of corporate closures and bankruptcies. Greece\\'s economy is estimated to have shrunk by a about a fifth since 2008, when it plunged into its deepest and longest post-war recession. About 600,000 jobs, more than one in ten, have been destroyed in the process. Things will get worse before they get better, according to analysts. \"Despite some emergency government measures to boost employment in early 2012, it is hard to see how the upward unemployment trend can be stabilized in the first half of the year,\" said Nikos Magginas, an economist at National Bank of Greece. A record 1,033,507 people were without work in December, 41 percent more than in the same month last year. The number in work dropped to a record low of 3,899,319, down 7.9 percent year-on-year. Pressured by its international backers under the terms of a planned European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout, the country\\'s second since 2010, Greece last month slashed its minimum monthly wage by about a fifth to about 580 euros ($760), gross, to encourage hirings. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, however, said on Wednesday this was still higher than other debt-laden countries such as Spain. The average jobless rate in the 17 countries sharing the euro rose slightly in December to a seasonally adjusted 10.6 percent, from 10.5 percent in November.

El Paso has about 773 million shares outstanding, according to Thomson Reuters data. \"We have concerns with the lack of transparency and the apparent conflicts of interest that have surrounded the share appraisal process and we believe that shareholders may not receive full value for their shares should this transaction, as currently structured, be consummated,\" a CalSTRS spokesman said. A shareholder group sued in January to stop the deal, arguing that El Paso adviser Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and El Paso Chief Executive Douglas Foshee had vested interests in holding down the price for the company. Goldman Sachs advised El Paso on the deal but also owns a sizable stake in acquirer Kinder Morgan through its private equity arm. A Delaware judge called the negotiating process \"disturbing\" in a ruling last week, but refused to block the acquisition, saying shareholders should decide for themselves if they want to accept the deal. El Paso delayed a planned vote on the deal after the ruling, moving the meeting at which shareholders will vote on the deal to Friday from Tuesday. While shareholders can still change their votes before the meeting, the company said on Monday that about 70 percent of its outstanding shares had already been voted as of March 2.

So, I see no risk to the dollar in those reforms,\" he said. China is planning to extend renminbi-denominated loans to its fellow BRICS countries - a grouping that includes China, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and India - in an attempt to boost trade between the leading emerging market nations and promote the use of the yuan, according to the Financial Times.

I don\\'t know, maybe in some long time after we\\'re all gone, it would be possible,\" Geithner said after he toured a railcar facility here.

After finding support at the 50-day moving average around 2,444 on Wednesday, the Euro STOXX 50 still has around 50 points to climb to reverse a steep sell off seen on Tuesday. According to technical analysts at Day By Day, the index remains in a correction phase from this year\\'s rally - which has taken it up 8.7 percent in 2-1/2 months - between 2,398 and 2,495 points. For some, though, the more upbeat market mood is a reason to start selling. BNP Paribas\\' European Love-Panic indicator, designed to track price action attributed to investor sentiment rather than fundamentals, has moved into convincingly positive territory, which the bank interprets as a signal to buy protection against possible weakness. It recommends a September 2012 options trade known as a \"put ladder\" on the Euro STOXX 50 at 2,540, 2,200 and 1,950 for a 1.9 percent premium. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Asset returns in 2012: link.reuters.com/nyw85s Euro zone debt crisis in graphics: r.reuters.com/hyb65p ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> The broader FTSE Eurofirst 300  .FTEU3  added 1.2 percent to 1,063.87. Among individual stocks, companies with global exposure performed strongly, while those relying on domestic consumers suffered as high unemployment led people to tighten their belts, hurting profits. Belgian supermarket group Delhaize ( DELB.BR ) and German consumer goods group Henkel ( HNKG_p.DE ) fell after posting weaker than expected results. Enel ( ENEI.MI ), Europe\\'s most indebted utility, lost 6.3 percent on its plans to cut its dividend and investments over the next five years. But AB InBev ( ABI.BR ), the world\\'s largest brewer, added 3 percent after painting an upbeat outlook for this year as it looks to drinkers outside Europe - in the United States and Brazil - to drive profits. EADS ( EAD.PA ), who sells jets to clients as far afield as Middle East and China, added 9 percent to lead the FTSE Eurofirst leader board after predicting a \"significant\" improvement in operating profit for 2012 and posting forecast-beating earnings for 2011. Few surprises are expected from Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings on Thursday. Both banks are seen leaving interest rates on hold. The ECB is likely to give markets time to absorb last month\\'s liquidity injections before considering any more such measures. The next big catalyst for markets is likely to be the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday. Wednesday\\'s private sector employment data boosted expectations of a strong number, with the next clue coming from the weekly jobs numbers at 1330 GMT. Consensus is for 210,000 new jobs to have been added in February. If the actual number is 100,000 higher, the Euro STOXX 50 index could add 0.7 percent shortly after publication of the report, according to Societe Generale research. However, based on long-term fair value, the bank also says that the consensus reading for the jobs number is in-line with a Euro STOXX 50 value of around 2,400 points, a bit below current levels.

      "{'text': ' The head of Qatar Airways, usually one of the aircraft industry\\'s fiercest critics, expressed confidence that Airbus and Boeing would resolve a series of high-profile glitches but warned against further production delays. \\n The endorsements from a top industry figure best known for lambasting manufacturers over delays will come as a relief to both planemakers as they count the cost of recent mishaps. Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said it was normal for new aircraft such as the Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A380 superjumbo and the Boeing ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner to have teething problems and stressed safety was not an issue. He also seemed satisfied with Boeing\\'s production plans for its new 787 Dreamliner, although many analysts have described the company\\'s plans to boost production to 10 aircraft a month by end-2013 from 2.5 now as optimistic. \"The 787 will be a very good airplane. I am confident,\" Al Baker told Reuters at a trade show on Wednesday. \"I cannot discuss the details, but I can tell you that they have a very achievable ramp-up strategy,\" he said after being briefed on the plans for record wide-body aircraft production. Boeing is grappling with a problem of delamination or the separation of bonded layers in part of the composite structure of its lightweight Dreamliner, while Airbus is wrestling with a series of cracks on components inside the wings of its A380 superjumbo. \"I think they will solve the problems with the A380. It is not a big issue...it is an aircraft that is in its infancy,\" said Al Baker. Analysts say Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) may take a charge of some 100 million euros for the cost of repairing the cracks and Airbus CEO Tom Enders has told staff the A380\\'s reputation is at stake and that no costs will be spared to resolve this. EADS will report 2011 earnings on Thursday. Al Baker\\'s remarks at a major travel industry event in Berlin contrast with his comments during the Dubai air show in November when he questioned whether Airbus was \"still learning how to build aircraft\". He has also recently criticized the Boeing 747-8 for being overweight and burning too much fuel. 777 PLANS Qatar is due to receive its first of 30 787s in June and its first A380 in 2013. With plans to unveil the 787 at the Farnborough air show in July, including lavish seats and entertainment consoles previewed on Wednesday, Al Baker said he would not accept any more delays to the 787, which is about 3 years late. He also warned Airbus against extending a six-month delay for the first variant of its future A350, the European company\\'s answer to the Dreamliner. Qatar now expects to receive the first of 80 planes in mid-2014 instead of late 2013. He repeated criticism of Airbus designs for the largest type of A350 -- the 370-passenger A350-1000 due in 2017, which has also failed to impress other Gulf carriers -- but said the designers had time to come up with improvements. Airbus and Boeing are involved in a tug of war over the direction of the lucrative \\'mini-jumbo\\' market, which is so far dominated by the still fast-selling Boeing 777. Airbus says its plane will replace the 777-300ER but Al Baker rejected this. He said he was \"satisfied\" with proposals for a new 777 presented in confidential briefings. Boeing has said it will decide what to do in this part of the market later this year. In a boost for Airbus, however, Qatar threw its weight behind the planemaker\\'s latest project by expressing interest in converting up to 20 of its A330 passenger jets into freighters. Al Baker had previously threatened to buy converted Boeing 767 aircraft because of a gap in Airbus\\'s cargo strategy. The plans would involve giving a second life hauling cargo to mid-sized passenger jets. Qatar operates six freighters but is not interested in buying new ones because the economics are not right, so it prefers to convert jetliners, Al Baker said. Some in the $100 billion annual aircraft industry dismiss Al Baker\\'s headline-grabbing criticisms as a negotiating ploy, but he insists he is defending the interests of an airline which is in the throes of dramatic expansion alongside others in the Gulf. \"When I need to criticize them (Airbus and Boeing) to wake them up I will and when they are doing things correctly, I should also give them credit,\" he told a news conference. \"I am known to be outspoken but I am also known to be fair. I am not on anyone\\'s payroll and I am looking at everything from the point of view of Qatar Airways.\" He also played down speculation that Qatar Airways would buy airlines in financial difficulties in Europe and said it had shelved plans to buy the new CSeries being developed by Canada\\'s Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ), but had \"not written the CSeries off\".

      "{'text': ' The International Energy Agency said on Thursday it was closely monitoring a pipeline outage that has halted a fifth of U.S. crude imports and added over $3 to oil prices. \\n\\n The IEA, which advises 26 industrialized nations, can tap its members\\' emergency reserves to prevent a global energy crisis. Lawrence Eagles, head of the IEA\\'s oil and industry markets division, said it was too early to say how much of an impact the incident will have on the market. An explosion hit a main pipeline that supplies Canadian crude to U.S. Midwest refineries on Wednesday, forcing operator Enbridge Inc to shut down four of its main pipelines. \"With any supply issue, we always monitor what is going on,\" But we have to have a better understanding of what the issue is at this point in time before making any comment,\" he said. \"You have to look at whether there are opportunities for re-routing supplies...and how long it\\'s going to take for repairs,\" he added. The pipeline carries an estimated 1.9 million barrels per day of Canadian crude to the United States, equivalent to about 9 percent of total U.S. oil demand. STANDS READY The last time the IEA released some of its emergency reserves was at the end of 2005 in the wake of Hurricane Katrina which devastated U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production. That release included refined oil products. A need for crude oil alone would most likely be met from U.S. strategic stocks. The IEA, created after the 1973-74 oil crisis, requires member countries to hold stocks of at least 90 days of net imports. But a continued rise in oil demand, an increased concentration of the remaining oil reserves in fewer countries, and a lack of upstream and downstream capacity additions are forcing the IEA to mount its preparedness in case of a crisis. In a report released before the pipeline explosion, the IEA said it stood ready for the growing risk of oil supply disruptions. \"The risk of oil supply disruptions has grown in recent years and will grow in the near future,\" it said in a new publication on oil supply security. \"But the IEA stands prepared.\" Oil stocks in member countries have grown by 14 percent since 2000 to 4.1 billion barrels at the end of 2006, when total stocks covered 122 days of net imports against an all-time low of 108 days in 2000.

Heinz Co HNZ.N posted an 18 percent jump in quarterly profit on Thursday as the weak U.S. dollar improved results in Europe and emerging markets, and price increases helped offset rising ingredient costs. \\n\\n The maker of Heinz ketchup, Ore-Ida potatoes and Smart Ones frozen meals also raised the top end of its fiscal 2008 earnings forecast as new products and a 23 percent increase in marketing lifted sales. Profit rose to $227 million, or 71 cents a share, in the company\\'s fiscal second quarter, ended October 31, from $191.6 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 67 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 13 percent to $2.52 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 8.1 percent . Like most U.S. food companies, Heinz has been facing higher costs for corn-based sweetener, dairy products and other ingredients. The company has raised prices and improved productivity to offset these higher expenses. Heinz said it now expects commodity costs to be up more than 7 percent this year, higher than the  5.5 percent the company forecast three months ago. With about 60 percent of Heinz\\'s sales coming from outside the United States, sales made in euros and other strong currencies have in part offset rising commodity costs, Chief Financial Officer Art Winkleblack said during a conference call with analysts. \"Our plan is to continue pricing up and aggressively drive productivity initiatives to offset the escalating commodity cost in the industry,\" Winkleblack said. Sales in the North American consumer products business rose 9.7 percent and profit in that business was up about 7 percent. Heinz Europe sales climbed 18 percent and profit rose 14.8 percent. Asia/Pacific sales rose 16.8 percent and profit increased 21.8 percent. But profit in the U.S. food service fell 13.5 percent, hurt by rising dairy costs and a 1.7 percent decrease in volume, a measure of products shipped that factors out price and currency fluctuations.

Schwarzenegger, at a press conference in Riverside County, whose housing market has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation, said the effort aims to prevent more than 100,000 California families from losing their homes. The effort will be aimed at educating borrowers whose mortgages have or will become too expensive after low initial interest rates reset at higher levels, telling them how to contact their lenders and on the perils of avoiding them. \"It\\'s a two-way street that got us into this mess,\" Schwarzenegger said at the press conference, aired on his Web site, adding it is imperative for borrowers and lenders to work together to strike deals to prevent foreclosures. Schwarzenegger also said he would press more lenders to join the four -- Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, GMAC GMA.N, Litton Loan Servicing LP and HomeEq Servicing Corp -- who signed on last week to a loan modification program negotiated by his office and based on a proposal by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

More than 20 million toys made there have been recalled worldwide over the past four months. In response, Beijing has promised to crack down on faulty manufacturers and suppliers, but also said much responsibility lies with foreign regulators and buyers. It has also made a point of naming foreign companies it claims also have problem products. A Wal-Mart Stores Inc spokesman, Jonathan Dong, said the blacklist -- which appeared on an official Web site on Thursday -- was more than two months old and the products, made in China, had long been cleared from the shelves. Inspectors had also blacklisted children\\'s toys at Wal-Mart stores in Beijing for problems regarding parts that could come off and cause harm if swallowed, the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce said on its Web site (www.hd315.gov.cn). The 54-item blacklist also included substandard children\\'s glasses, toothbrushes, building blocks and bikes with shoddy brakes and handlebars, at a number of Chinese retailers. \"If consumers have bought the substandard goods, with proof of purchase they can request the vendor to recall the goods,\" the notice said. Six children\\'s products stocked at Wal-Mart branches in Beijing had failed to meet standards, the notice said. Wal-Mart\\'s \"Bo bo\" brand of \"water jugs\" had failed plastic integrity standards, according to the notice. \"Over a long period of use, toxins could accumulate in the body and cause harm,\" the notice said. Wal-Mart spokesman Dong confirmed the blacklist and said the retailer had been notified of the quality results. He said he was not sure why the notice had appeared on the Web site on Thursday. \"I guess they just wanted to be transparent about it,\" he said. Dong said any versions of the products now on sale had been deemed safe, but customers with doubts could nonetheless return them. Last week, Wal-Mart was one of 20 companies sued by the California attorney general and Los Angeles city attorney for manufacturing or selling toys with unlawfully high levels of lead. Chinese-made Carrefour drawing pens were found with excessive levels of lead and chromium. A Carrefour spokesman contacted by phone was unable to provide immediate comment and requested an e-mail of questions. The Chinese producer of the bead toys that caused recalls in the United States and Australia has apologized for using a toxic \"date-rape\" drug and damaging the reputation of the made-in-China label, state media said on Thursday.

      "{'text': ' Retailers may be touting their environmental-friendliness this year, but just about the only \"green\" in evidence for the holidays is in the usual Christmas decorations. \\n\\n Thick catalogs continue to clog mailboxes, store personnel keep handing out free gift boxes, and plastic bags are everywhere. There is little to no signage in stores emphasizing eco-friendly products, beyond those at select chains known for their environmental thrust. \"There are a lot of stories in the media about \\'green,\\'\" said Laurie Brooks, a spokeswoman for L.L. Bean, which sells clothing and outdoor gear. \"I think it really hasn\\'t trickled down to the consumer level yet.\" And amid fears that shoppers may clamp down on holiday spending in the wake of higher food and fuel prices, the slowing U.S housing market and the credit crunch, retailers are loath to do anything to turn off their clientele. \"The consumer is consumed with other things, and very rarely have they ever endorsed and embraced the green endeavors,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at research firm NPD Group. GREEN BEHIND THE SCENES As fears over global warming have dominated headlines this year, numerous retailers have announced new and expanded plans to cut down on waste and run stores more efficiently. Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), which has a goal of one day being supplied 100 percent by renewable energy and creating zero waste, is pushing its vendors to reduce the amount of packaging they use and make products that consume less power. Department store operator Kohl\\'s Corp ( KSS.N ) is working on implementing rooftop solar energy systems, while consumer electronics chain Best Buy Co Inc ( BBY.N ) is giving grants to organizations that hold electronics recycling events. But this holiday season, there is a divide between the environmental tactics retailers are implementing behind the scenes -- like building stores with recycled materials or using hybrid vehicles -- and the shopping experience they provide. During the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, a Wal-Mart store in Columbia, Maryland, had no displays of the efforts the world\\'s largest retailer is making to go green. And at a nearby L.L. Bean store, shoppers could scoop up as many boxes as they wanted. Brooks said L.L. Bean did not actively promote its environmental efforts to its customers, but she said the gift boxes the retailer handed out were recyclable and made from recycled content. While the company has not cut down on the catalogs it mails, they contain a higher percentage of recycled content, she said. L.L. Bean has also retrofitted stores with energy-efficient lighting and converted its trucks to biodiesel fuel. \"These are things that aren\\'t really visible to customers,\" she said. \"We\\'re doing it behind the scenes.\" MISSED OPPORTUNITY? Stacy Janiak, U.S. retail leader at Deloitte, said retailers were missing a valuable opportunity by not promoting green products or eco-friendly business practices. According to a survey commissioned by Deloitte, 18 percent of respondents said they would purchase more eco-friendly products this holiday season than in the past, and 17 percent said they will shop at more green retailers. \"Another key fact from the survey was that 17 percent said they\\'re willing to pay more for green gifts,\" Janiak said. \"That\\'s a big marketing opportunity for retailers. If they\\'re not taking advantage of it this holiday season, you can bet they\\'re going to through the upcoming year.\" One retailer making a big push is upscale department store operator Barneys, which sent out a catalog emblazoned with the words, \"Have a Green Holiday.\" Not worried about its higher-end customers pulling back on spending, it is advertising organic cotton products like a $595 dress and a $68 T-shirt. But many retailers are debating how far they should push the green concept and whether customers even want these items. Brooks said L.L. Bean had not seen an overwhelming demand for more organic cotton or bamboo products. A spokeswoman for Target Corp ( TGT.N ) said that while the discounter sells items like organic cotton sheets and energy-efficient lighting, it was not incorporating a green message into its holiday marketing. Wal-Mart also said it did not have a green marketing plan in place for Christmas. Although J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) opened a new department store to test eco-friendly building methods, a spokesman said it was too soon to make a big push to sell and promote green merchandise. \"It\\'s something that is growing in importance with the customer,\" he said, but added: \"It\\'s early days.\" But NPD\\'s Cohen said the green trend was already over. \"It\\'s basically a card that a lot of people played while it was hot and trendy,\" he said. \"And it got overplayed.\" (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)', 'date': ' Thu Nov 29, 2007 2:39pm EST\\n', 'title': ' Retailers keep \"green\" behind the scenes\\n', 'author': ' By  Nicole Maestri\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/29/us-retail-holiday-green-idUSN2920564520071129\\n\\n \\n\\n COLUMBIA, Maryland  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Home prices posted the first quarterly drop in 13 years in the third quarter, dragging down annual price appreciation to the slowest pace since 1995, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said on Thursday. \\n\\n Compared with the second quarter of 2007, house prices fell 0.4 percent, the government regulator said in a statement on its Web site. The annual price increase slowed to 1.8 percent, the lowest four-quarter rise since 1995. \"While select markets still maintain robust rates of appreciation, our newest data show price weakening in a very significant portion of the country,\" OFHEO Director James Lockhart said in the statement. \"Indeed, in the third quarter, more than 20 states experienced price declines and in some cases those declines are substantial,\" he said. Prices dropped in 10 states over the last four quarters, the largest number of states posting declines since the 1996-1997 period. Many cities and states where prices are slumping the most had staged the biggest price surges earlier in the decade, OFHEO said. \"Rising inventories of for-sale properties are clearly having a material impact on home prices,\" OFHEO Chief Economist Patrick Lawler said in the statement. \"Until those inventories shrink, that will be a great source of resistance to price increases.\" Home foreclosures are boosting the supply of unsold homes and also pressing on prices. \"Compounding this influence is the fact that the sellers of foreclosed homes, frequently creditors, may be strongly averse to holding onto the property for an extended period of time. As a result, they may be willing to sell for lower prices than resident homeowners,\" OFHEO said in its report. Falling prices mean more homeowners without equity, meaning the value of their house is less than their mortgage balance. Owners in this situation may just walk away from the property and mortgage, OFHEO said. REPORTS DIVERGE BUT STORY SIMILAR While OFHEO still shows home prices up over the year, in stark contrast the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, the path of the gauges is similar. Home prices are appreciating less or dropping in a growing number of states. The S&P/Case-Shiller index this week showed prices slid 4.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, matching a record drop from the prior period. In the quarter, the index dropped 1.7 percent from the second quarter, its biggest quarterly drop in the index\\'s 21 year history. OFHEO, for its part, said its index \"weights sales prices differently than other measures, incorporates data from a wider geographic area and is focused on homes with conventional, conforming loans.\" Conforming loans are $417,000 or less, and thus can be purchased by top U.S. home funding companies Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. OFHEO\\'s index tracks average single-family house price change in repeat sales or refinancings of the same homes, and is based on data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. WINNERS, LOSERS Michigan, California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Rhode Island had the biggest price declines over the year, OFHEO said. Prices fell 3.7 percent in Michigan, 3.6 percent in California and 2.4 percent in Nevada. Prices in states such as California and Nevada surged earlier this decade, driven by speculators looking to quickly sell at a profit. Many of those owners are now stuck with empty homes they cannot turn around even as prices sink. Seventeen of the 20 cities with the most annual price depreciation were in Florida, another state with heavy speculative buying, and California, OFHEO said. Utah, Wyoming, Montana and New Mexico had the fastest price appreciation over the year. Prices rose 12.9 percent in Utah, 11.8 percent in Wyoming, 7.7 percent in Montana and 7.4 percent in New Mexico.', 'date': ' Thu Nov 29, 2007 12:31pm EST\\n', 'title': ' Annual home price rise slowest since 1995\\n', 'author': ' By  Lynn Adler\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/29/us-usa-housing-prices-idUSNYC00005220071129\\n\\n \\n\\n NEW YORK  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Soft sales and plunging prices for new homes, together with a surge in claims for new jobless benefits highlighted a slide in U.S. economic activity that forced the Bush administration on Thursday to scale back its estimate for growth in 2008. \\n\\n A day after Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said economic uncertainties were \"unusually high\" and no end was in sight to the housing slump, the Commerce Department said median home sales prices in October tumbled at the steepest rate since 1970 on a year-over-year basis to $217,800, a 13 percent drop. That took the glow off a separate report from the Commerce Department that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of national economic activity, climbed at a revised 4.9 percent rate in the third quarter, its best performance in four years. Previously, the department said third-quarter growth was at a 3.9 percent rate, but even the revised figure was largely dismissed as old data by financial market participants more preoccupied with risks a downturn could become a recession. NEW, DARKER WORLD \"It is a completely different world now and we expect GDP to actually contract over the final three months of this year,\" said Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics Inc in London. \"The chances of an outright recession -- two quarters of negative growth -- are probably as high as 50-50.\" Stock prices ended the day little changed, with the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  off 9.43 points to 13,280 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  down 4.55 points to 2,658. But bond prices jumped as investors sought safer haven than stocks. Two-year notes traded 6/32 higher in price for a yield of 3.07 percent, down from 3.19 percent late on Wednesday, while 5-year notes rose 13/32 for a yield of 3.41 percent compared with 3.50 percent a day earlier. The White House acknowledged that economic prospects were suffering, recasting its estimates for 2008 GDP growth downward to 2.7 percent from 3.1 percent that it forecast in June. In an interview from Los Angeles, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said 2.7 percent growth should still be regarded as healthy and added: \"We believe other sectors of the economy can offset the housing correction.\" The Commerce Department said new-home sales in October were at an annual rate of 728,000 units, well below Wall Street economists\\' forecasts for a 750,000-unit rate. The department revised down September new-home sales steeply to a 716,000-unit rate from a previously reported 770,000, further underlining the housing sector\\'s decline. Separately, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment aid jumped by 23,000 last week to the highest since February, though the figure might have been affected by the fact that last Thursday was the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday. DAMPER ON CONSUMER SPIRITS Another report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) said U.S. housing prices posted their first quarterly drop in 13 years during the third quarter. That is likely to act as a damper on consumer spirits after years in which many homeowners felt free to tap the accumulated equity in their homes to finance spending. \"While select markets still maintain robust rates of appreciation, our newest data show price weakening in a very significant portion of the country,\" OFHEO Director James Lockhart said. Falling home prices, weakening consumer confidence and the pickup in jobless claims reinforced the view of many private-sector analysts that the economy was at risk of a more serious downturn than policy-makers wish to acknowledge. \"It looks like it could be lights out for the economy,\" said economist Chris Rupkey of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York, referring to the rise in claims. \"This is exactly what it looks like when we are going into recession.\" Economist Steven Wieting of Citigroup said that after showing surprising resilience through 2-1/2 years of housing declines, the economy now faced pressure from tightening credit conditions. As a result, \"We...think growth in the fourth quarter will be below 1 percent,\" he added. The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, in its latest Beige Book survey of national economic conditions, that growth had slowed in October and the first half of November, largely because of an \"ongoing slowdown\" in the housing sector. Kohn said on Wednesday that policy-makers had to stay \"nimble\" and to be prepared for \"flexible and pragmatic policy-making,\" words that markets took to mean the Fed was likely to lower interest rates further as a stimulant. On another down note, the International Monetary Fund said it will revise down its October estimate of 4.8 percent for world growth in 2008, given the impact of costlier oil and continued financial market turbulence. \"Some of the downside risks that we had identified (in October) have materialized,\" IMF spokesman Masood Ahmed said.

      "{'text': ' A surge in inventory-building and robust exports propelled U.S. economic growth ahead at the fastest rate in four years during the third quarter, but a jump in claims for jobless benefits last week underscored the sharp slowdown now under way. \\n\\n The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that gross domestic product that measures total production within U.S. borders climbed at a revised 4.9 percent annual rate instead of 3.9 percent reported a month ago. It was the strongest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2003 when GDP surged at a 7.5 percent rate and slightly exceeded Wall Street economists\\' forecast for a 4.8 percent rate of increase. The department revises its GDP figure twice after its initial estimate and will publish its final figure for third-quarter performance on December 20. Third-quarter GDP is now regarded as old information by Wall Street participants, who focused on the surge in jobless aid claims. A slumping housing sector and waning consumer confidence already is predicted to sap fourth-quarter growth and analysts say that risks are rising for a recession next year. The Labor Department said new claims for unemployment aid jumped by 23,000 last week to the highest since February, though that figure might have been affected by the fact that last Thursday was the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday. \"It looks like it could be lights out for the economy,\" said economist Chris Rupkey of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York, referring to the rise in claims. \"This is exactly what it looks like when we are going into recession.\" Economist Steven Wieting of Citigroup said that after showing surprising resilience through 2-1/2 years of housing declines, the economy now faced pressure from tightening credit conditions.

The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, in its latest Beige Book survey of national economic conditions, that growth had slowed in October and the first half of November, largely because of an \"ongoing slowdown\" in the housing sector. The GDP report showed companies built up inventories twice as fast during the third quarter as the government had estimated a month ago - at a $32.9-billion annual rate instead of $15.7 billion. Higher inventories add to growth and likely reflect stockpiling ahead of the Thanksgiving-to-Christmas holiday sales season but they can be a drag on future performance if sales do not meet expectations. A cheaper U.S. dollar appeared to be paying off in the form of a stronger trade performance. U.S. exports climbed at an 18.9 percent annual rate instead of 16.2 percent. It was the strongest growth in exports since the final quarter of 2003 and more than double the second quarter\\'s 7.5 percent rate. Imports were up at a revised 4.3 percent annual rate instead of 5.2 percent, following a 2.7 percent rate of contraction in the second quarter.

      "{'text': ' Del Monte Foods Co DLM.N posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday and cut its full-year earnings forecast because of soaring costs for ingredients like wheat, corn and fish. \\n\\n The news sent Del Monte\\'s stock down more than 6 percent. The maker of Del Monte canned vegetables, Meow Mix cat food and StarKist tuna said profit was $25.9 million, or 13 cents a share, in the second quarter, ended October 28, compared with $23.2 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs, earnings were 14 cents a share, falling short of the average analyst estimate of 17 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Like all food companies, Del Monte has been hit by rising commodity costs and has tried to offset those costs with price increases and cost-cutting measures. \"A lot of their brands, particularly on the consumer products side, are tied too closely to commodity prices,\" An Gilpin, an analyst at Morningstar, said. Del Monte is trying to shift to more value-added food products that can command a higher price and keep consumers from moving to lower-priced private label brands, Gilpin said. \"I think that\\'s an evolution that is happening right now -- unfortunately, it is not happening fast enough,\" she said. One commodity hurting the company is fish. The cost of skipjack tuna was up more than 65 percent during the quarter compared with a year earlier and fish costs make up half of the operating cost in the company\\'s seafood business, according to Del Monte. \"The higher price of skipjack is not expected to be offset,\" Richard Wolford, chairman and chief executive officer, said during a conference call with analysts. Sales rose 5 percent to $938.1 million in the second quarter. Del Monte said it now expects earnings of 64 cents to 68 cents a share for the year, down from its previous forecast of 70 cents to 74 cents a share. Del Monte shares were down 57 cents at $9.15 at midday on the New York Stock exchange.

      "{'text': ' Warner Music Group WMG.N, the world\\'s No. 3 music company, on Thursday said profits fell 58 percent as CD sales slipped further, but shares rose as investors hoped the worst of an industry slump was priced into its stock. \\n\\n Warner Music shares closed up more than 8 percent, as analysts said it beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter. \"The numbers were better than people thought, they were certainly better than we thought they would be,\" said Bishop Cheen, analyst at Wachovia. \"Clearly the U.S. team is making it happen where they\\'re out-performing the market.\" Warner\\'s net profit was $5 million, or 3 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from a year-earlier profit of $12 million or 8 cents per share. The 2007 quarter benefited from a $12 million settlement from Bertelsmann AG over music downloading service Napster, but that was partly offset by $9 million in restructuring costs. Revenue rose 2 percent to $869 million, but declined 2 percent when taking out the impact of a weaker dollar. Warner\\'s strong sellers included Linkin Park, James Blunt and Michael Buble. But the company also posted weaker international sales, particularly in the United Kingdom. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates were looking for revenue of $869.5 million, on average, and a net loss of 10 cents per share. Album sales in the United States fell 14 percent as of the end of last week from a year ago, according to data from Nielsen SoundScan. More fans bought individual songs through online stores such as Apple Inc\\'s ( AAPL.O ) iTunes, or used free file-sharing services to get music. Digital music revenue was up 25 percent at $130 million during the quarter, but this could not make up for a shortfall in compact disc sales FASTER RATE OF CD DECLINES Warner\\'s stock price is still down more than 66 percent since the start of the year as evidence that the decline in music sales had accelerated became more clear to investors. Like other major music companies, Warner is trying to expand ties with its artists beyond recording and publishing, to include new digital services as well as share in image rights, advertising, touring and management revenue. Chief Executive Edgar Bronfman accepted that not all of Warner\\'s artists would agree to new relationships. \"I think you\\'ll see us coming to agreements with a number of existing artists and I think you\\'ll see us not coming to agreement with a number of existing artists,\" he said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. Last month, Madonna, one of the world\\'s top-selling artists, said she would leave Warner Music to sign with concert promoter Live Nation Inc ( LYV.N ). Warner retains the rights to all of Madonna\\'s recordings to date and her publishing rights. \"There will be some agreements that existing artists sign with others, as has been the case with Madonna, where it was in our view economically imprudent to do that deal,\" Bronfman said. On Wednesday, Warner said it formed a joint partnership with the estate of Frank Sinatra to manage all music, film and stage rights of the late singer as well as administer all licenses for the Sinatra name and likeness. Warner is now the only major record and publishing music company still publicly traded after London-based EMI Group was taken private by leveraged buyout firm Terra Firma this year. Shares in Warner Music rose 58 cents, or 8.1 percent, to close at $7.73 at close on Thursday.

Shares of Exxon rose nearly 1 percent as an explosion at a pipeline disrupted the flow of oil from Canada to U.S. Midwest refineries. Caution before a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday evening also kept a lid on the market and some investors opted to sell some of the winners from the recent rebound, such as banks. \"This is a highly volatile market,\" said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto, Canada. \"It has suddenly shifted to big energy and financial shares are a little weaker.\" The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 22.28 points, or 0.17 percent, to 13,311.73.

Shares of ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) gained 1.4 percent at $78.82, while Chevron ( CVX.N ) gained 0.6 percent to $86.56. Shares of Altria, parent of cigarette maker Philip Morris, ended up 2.6 percent at $75.98 on the NYSE, after surging to an all-time high of $76.15. Companies that make consumer staples such as cigarettes, fast-food and soft drinks are seen as better investments in the face of a slowing economy. AT&T, APPLE RING UP GAINS AT&T Inc ( T.N ), the No. 1 U.S. mobile provider, also stood out, ending up 1.4 percent at $38.03. Its chief executive announced 2008 plans for a new version of Apple Inc\\'s ( AAPL.O ) iPhone with high-speed wireless Web links.  Apple shares lent the biggest boost to the Nasdaq\\'s advance, ending up 2.3 percent at $184.29. But after the bell, Dell Inc DELL.O, the world\\'s second-largest personal computer maker, gave a cautious outlook despite reporting a higher quarterly profit, sending its stock down nearly 7 percent.  Dell shares had ended up 1.6 percent at $28.14 on the Nasdaq ahead of its results. FINANCIALS RETREAT In the regular session, financial shares headed lower after a two-day surge. Shares of American Express ( AXP.N ) were among the Dow\\'s top drags, down 0.9 percent at $56.89. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N declined 4.9 percent to $61.69 on the New York Stock Exchange after CIBC World Markets analyst Meredith Whitney cut her price target and profit estimates.  Retailers were led lower by Sears Holdings ( SHLD.O ), which reported sharply lower earnings. Sears stock lost 10.5 percent to $104.09, while Macy\\'s Inc ( M.N ) was down 1.7 percent at $29.30. U.S. crude for January delivery last traded up 38 cents at $91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where it ranged from $90.43 to $95.17. ECONOMY, THE FED In economic news, softer-than-expected new-home sales and a surge in new claims for jobless benefits reported on Thursday heightened fears of a steep U.S. economic slide and overshadowed a strong third-quarter performance. Trading was light on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.33 billion shares changing hands, below last year\\'s estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.17 billion shares changed hands, above last year\\'s daily average of 2.02 billion.

All Enbridge pipelines in the vicinity -- Lines 1, 2, 3 and 4 -- were immediately shut down and isolated and Enbridge emergency crews were dispatched to the site, it said.

In its twice-yearly forecast, which will be incorporated in the administration\\'s fiscal 2009 budget proposal due early next year, the White House said it now expected real gross domestic product to grow 2.7 percent in 2008, down from a June forecast for 3.1 percent growth. \"We are forecasting solid growth for 2008,\" top White House economist Edward Lazear told reporters. He added that \"2.7 percent is still a good, solid growth rate and that is especially the case given that we have been hit with a pretty significant slide in the housing market.\" In housing, the decline \"has been more pronounced than we forecast at the time that we were doing our midsession review and that\\'s built into the forecast for next year,\" said Lazear, who is chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. The administration\\'s forecast was still above Federal Reserve policy-makers\\' projection of 1.8 percent to 2.5 percent real, or inflation-adjusted, GDP growth for 2008. Private economists in the closely watched Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey have predicted sluggish growth through the first half of 2008. That survey pegged GDP growth for next year at 2.4 percent, below the White House forecast. The Blue Chip panel said the odds of a recession were about one-in-three. The administration said it thought the U.S. unemployment rate would average 4.9 percent during 2008, a few notches above the 4.7 percent forecast of the June forecast. The White House raised its 2007 real GDP forecast to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent, reflecting surprisingly strong third-quarter growth. \"While the difficulties in housing and credit markets and the effects of high energy prices will extract a penalty from growth, the U.S. economy has many strengths and I expect the expansion to continue,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in a statement. Lazear said he expected housing to hurt GDP at least through the first half of next year. Private economists have been ratcheting down their economic growth forecasts in recent months as the slumping housing market and ensuing credit crunch threaten to slow consumer and business spending. Allan Hubbard, the top White House economic adviser, said this week that U.S. recession risks had increased, although he put the chances at less than 50-50. Hubbard announced his resignation on Wednesday. The White House acknowledged that rising food and energy prices have pushed up inflation, and it now expects the consumer price index to rise 3.9 percent in 2007, rather than the 3.2 percent predicted earlier. However, the administration expects inflation to ease next year. For 2008, the report estimated an inflation rate of 2.1 percent, down from the prior forecast of 2.5 percent.

      "{'text': ' Apparel retailer J. Crew Group Inc JCG.N posted a surprising 21 percent rise in revenues and net profit above  Wall Street\\'s expectations on Thursday, while a raised outlook for the full year sent shares up over 10 percent. \\n\\n A focus on unique fashions for a more affluent customer at J. Crew stores, catalog and online businesses kept revenue robust, the company said, during a pre-holiday quarter marked by uneven consumer spending for other American retailers. Net income in the third quarter increased to $26.8 million, or 42 cents per share, from $26 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company\\'s tax rate was significantly lower. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 36 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose to $332.7 million, the company said, well ahead of a Wall Street consensus view of $312.7 million. Same-store sales, a key gauge of retail performance that measures sales at established stores, rose 8 percent in the quarter, while sales through the company\\'s catalog and Web site rose by 36 percent, the company said. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 39.8 percent compared with 7.1 percent a year earlier. Higher-than-expected sales, together with better leverage from selling, general and administrative expenses, helped drive a 44 percent increase in operating income, while improving operating profit margins to 14.3 percent of revenues from 12 percent a year earlier. Chief Executive Millard Drexler said the company\\'s direct- to-consumer business was seeing fewer returns, while investments in that business, such as a new email strategy to stay in touch with consumers, were paying off. \"Quality and style keeps us, I think, at the forefront,\" Drexler told analysts during a conference call. \"We don\\'t want to be in the price business. As I look at the world today, there\\'s some great price players out there on basics, on commodities and we move away from that. \"We have taken our business very strategically up a notch or two every season so to speak, since we have all been running the company,\" said Drexler, adding that his customers do not express \"resistance to price.\" In posting third quarter results, many apparel retailers complained of light mall traffic and consumers that stayed away from stores due to warm weather and more cautious spending amid high gas prices, a slowing housing market and residual effects from the credit crisis. As part of J Crew\\'s focus on unique, quality design, Drexler said the company was moving away from certain lower- price fabrications, saying he would leave the strategy of using cheaper fabrics to sell trendy designs at low prices to fast- fashion retailers such as Top Shop and H&M, owned by Hennes & Mauritz AB ( HMb.ST ). \"We don\\'t want to be in the unit velocity game, but the dollar velocity game,\" Drexler said. \"We just want to play in that niche which is style and quality and great product design.\" Looking ahead, J Crew expects earnings per share for the fiscal year of between $1.50 and $1.52, up from its earlier outlook of a range between $1.42 and $1.46. Wall Street, on average, has been expecting fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.46, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales are expected to rise in the mid-single digit range, the company said. The company\\'s shares rose $4.20 to $44.50 after closing at $40.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Department of Transportation said it was unlikely to force Enbridge to reduce throughput at the 1.5 million-barrel-per-day (bpd) system -- the biggest U.S. import pipeline -- as it investigates the cause of the blast. \"At this time, we wouldn\\'t expect a restriction on this incident based on what we know so far,\" said Brian Pierzina, senior engineer and inspector for the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety. The incident occurred after four other accidents on the Enbridge system this year, but the company said it occured during routine repairs and was not the result of weakened or corroded steel. Workers were wrapping up repair work on a section of pipe on the system\\'s Line 3 near Clearbrook, Minnesota, when the oil spilled and ignited, Enbridge vice-president Leon Zupan told reporters during a conference call. \"It was at the tail end of this repair and replacement process when we restarted Line 3 and we ended up with the release from the line through one of these fittings,\" he said. U.S. oil surged more than $4 a barrel early Thursday before easing back later as Midwest refiners scrambled to find alternate supplies on concerns about a prolonged crimp in Canadian crude flows. The Department of Energy said it was contacting refiners in the region to see if they needed oil from the emergency stockpile, but Midwestern refiners said they did not anticipate a shortfall in the near-term.  NO TERROR LINK The U.S. Homeland Security Department said there were no known links to terrorism in the fire, which was extinguished on Thursday, allowing three of the four Enbridge pipelines to be restarted. Only the 450,000 bpd line 3 remained shut and was expected to come back online in the next few days following the deadly blast. \"This is an incident that has really shaken us in that it involves the death of two outstanding employees, and our concerns right now are not with the reputation of Enbridge but with the families of the two employees who were involved,\" Chief Executive Pat Daniel said. Canada is the top supplier of U.S. imported crude, with the Enbridge line shipping around 1.1 million bpd of oil to the U.S. midcontinent region. Capacity on the pipeline is growing tight due to rising oil production in Alberta and Enbridge has been working to expand the pipeline. \"The timing is pretty bad. We are coming to the strongest demand period for crude with the approach of the Northern winter,\" said Mark Pervan, analyst at ANZ Bank.

      "{'text': ' Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday a resurgence in financial strains in recent weeks had dimmed the outlook for the U.S. economy, signaling an openness to lowering interest rates again. \\n\\n \"The outlook has ... been importantly affected over the past month by renewed turbulence in financial markets, which has partially reversed the improvement that occurred in September and October,\" he said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. \"We at the Fed will have to remain exceptionally alert and flexible.\" A copy of his remarks was made available in Washington. The Fed\\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will weigh fresh information about hiring, spending and financial markets when it next meets to consider interest rates on December 11, Bernanke said. The Fed lowered benchmark rates by a cumulative three-quarters of a percentage point to 4.5 percent in September and October to buffer the economy from a prolonged housing slump and credit market turbulence. \"In making its policy decision, the committee will have to judge whether the outlook for the economy or the balance of risks has shifted materially,\" he said. \"In doing so, we will take full account of the implications for the outlook of both the incoming economic data and the ongoing developments in the financial markets.\" Bernanke\\'s comments echoed those made on Wednesday by Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who said he had been caught off guard by how poorly financial markets have fared since the central bank last met on October 30-31. Bernanke said economic data since that meeting had been mixed, with continued weakness in home sales and construction alongside a solid labor market in October. Weekly data on unemployment insurance claims had drifted higher, but was consistent with a moderate expansion in employment, he said. Meanwhile, household spending has been soft, Bernanke said. \"I expect household income and spending to continue to grow, but the combination of higher gas prices, the weak housing market, tighter credit conditions, and declines in stock prices seem likely to create some headwinds for the consumer in the months ahead,\" he said. Bernanke said that core inflation, which strips out volatile foods and energy costs, had been moderate, but he took note of the rising price of oil and said rising costs for food and some imported goods could also put upward pressure in inflation. \"The effectiveness of monetary policy depends critically on maintaining the public\\'s confidence that inflation will be well controlled,\" he said. \"We are accordingly monitoring inflation developments closely.\" (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; editing by Leslie Adler)', 'date': ' Thu Nov 29, 2007 6:57pm EST\\n', 'title': ' Bernanke: Financial strains dimming outlook\\n', 'author': ' \\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/29/us-usa-fed-bernanke-idUSN2924481520071129\\n\\n \\n\\n WASHINGTON  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Buyers spent $733 million bargain-hunting on \"Cyber Monday,\" up 21 percent from a year earlier, and some analysts expect that one-day tally to be topped as Christmas nears. \\n\\n The biggest online traffic winners on the Monday after Thanksgiving included retailers Amazon.com Inc, Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy Co, Internet research firm comScore Inc said on Wednesday. Cyber Monday marked the first time that a single day of online spending broke the $700 million mark, comScore said. The Monday after the four-day holiday weekend has been dubbed Cyber Monday because many consumers return to work and seek deals not found in bricks-and-mortar retailers using their employers\\' high-speed Internet connections. ComScore said 60 percent of the money spent online on Monday came from work computers. \"It\\'s clear that Cyber Monday is the biggest day of the 2007 holiday shopping season so far,\" said Ken Cassar, an analyst with Nielsen Online. Nielsen data indicated 32.5 million people shopped online on Cyber Monday, up 10 percent from a year earlier and higher than the 28.8 million who shopped online on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving that kicks off the holiday season for offline retailers. Cassar and others said the Cyber Monday figures would likely be surpassed in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Though retail watchers expected online sales to spike on Cyber Monday, some say the phenomenon could be waning as retailers lure online shoppers earlier in the season. Historically, online shopping picks up as the holiday season progresses. \"(Monday,) December 17 could be the heaviest day\" of the online shopping season, based on typical trends, said Andrew Lipsman, a senior analyst with comScore. He noted that while Cyber Monday sales spiked in 2006, the day wound up as just the 12th-heaviest online spending day once the holiday season was over. \"Spending continues to build over the next couple of weeks, and it usually peaks in December,\" Lipsman said. BARGAIN HUNT Deep discounts were a factor this year. A survey by BizRate Research of 116 online retailers found that 72.2 percent planned a special promotion for Cyber Monday, up from 42.7 percent of online merchants two years ago. \"It does seem like the promotions get more aggressive each year,\" said Lipsman. But those bargains could backfire later in the holiday season as rising food and fuel prices and a troubled housing market threaten to dampen consumer spending, Cassar cautioned. ComScore said the number of Cyber Monday buyers rose 38 percent from a year ago, but average spending per buyer slipped 12 percent partly because of discounting. \"If people did shop heavily on Cyber Monday driven by promotions, are these sales that won\\'t happen later in the season?\" Cassar said. \"There is some risk that retailers may push sales early in the season at the expense of higher-margin sales later,\" he added. Other highly trafficked sites on Cyber Monday included those belonging to Target Corp and computer maker Dell Inc, according to comScore. Sanford Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay said he expects a strong fourth quarter for retailers Amazon and eBay Inc, as more consumers seek deals online. \"We believe that large numbers of consumers are already using the Internet to find bargains, save on time and gasoline by avoiding store visits, and get better selection and choice online,\" Lindsay said in a research note on Wednesday.

      "{'text': ' Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) reported sharply lower third-quarter profit on Thursday, sending its shares down as much as 14 percent to new lows, as sales fell at its U.S. Kmart and Sears stores and it cut prices to clear excess inventory. \\n\\n The retailer controlled by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert said sales and margins would probably remain under pressure for the current quarter as the softer U.S. housing market and credit concerns hurt consumer spending during the critical holiday shopping season. \"Kmart and Sears have been in a downward spiral for the last two years,\" said Britt Beemer, founder of America\\'s Research Group, which surveys consumer behavior. \"I think you\\'re in a major free-fall.\" Beemer said Thanksgiving weekend surveys by his group indicated that both chains have 20 percent fewer shoppers than they did three years ago. There has been \"no effort to make Kmart or Sears competitive,\" Beemer said. The company was formed in the 2005 merger of Sears, Roebuck and Kmart. Net income fell 99 percent to $2 million, or 1 cent a share, for the third quarter ended November 3 from $196 million, or $1.27 a share, a year earlier. Share count was lower in the latest period as Sears bought back 6.7 million common shares. The 2006 quarter included $64 million in gains tied to swap investments. Excluding that item, the year-ago profit was 85 cents a share. Sears Holdings, which earlier this week offered to buy specialty retailer Restoration Hardware Inc RSTO.O for about $269 million, attributed its current problems to everything from increased competition to unseasonably warm weather. But in a statement, Chief Executive Aylwin Lewis said: \"We cannot blame our results entirely on the retail and macro-economic environments.\" Sears, which has unveiled new marketing campaigns this year, has \"much on which to improve,\" he added. Revenue fell 3 percent to $11.5 billion as domestic same-store sales fell 4.2 percent at Sears, Roebuck and 5 percent at Kmart, pulling total domestic same-store sales down 4.6 percent. The company cited notable declines in apparel and lawn and garden sales, partly offset by higher sales of electronics at U.S. Sears stores. \\'DEATH SPIRAL?\\' Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note titled \"Death Spiral?\" that there was \"nothing good\" to take from the latest earnings report. \"It should be clear to investors that if Sears continues to try to make it as a retailer, it will likely not happen,\" Balter wrote. Gross margin contracted to 27.4 percent of sales from 28.3 percent a year earlier as the Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company cut prices to sell seasonal goods. Sears competes with many other chains, including Macy\\'s Inc ( M.N ) in clothing sales and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) and other discounters in general merchandise. In appliances, Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) and Lowe\\'s Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) have chipped away at Sears\\' dominant market share. Before the merger, Lampert had gained favor at Kmart for making shareholders rich by selling prime real estate. In many quarters following the 2005 merger, Sears Holdings posted hefty profit growth even as sales declined, in part due to cost-cutting. But Lampert\\'s team has come under increased criticism this year as that earnings growth has stalled. Profit fell 40 percent in the second quarter, and same-store sales at Kmart and Sears, Roebuck have sagged for the past seven quarters. \"These (latest) quarterly results prove that a financial guy can\\'t run a retail operation,\" Beemer said. \"You can\\'t cut expenses and grow market share.\" Standard & Poor\\'s Equity Research slapped a \"sell\" rating on Sears Holdings, replacing its prior \"hold\" rating. \"Given limited success of remerchandising efforts at Sears and Kmart segments, increased competition, and a projected slowdown in consumer spending, we think Sears\\' chances of executing a turnaround are slim,\" S&P analyst Jason Asaeda said in a statement. Sears had cash of $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $2.1 billion a year earlier. Investors watch the cash balance closely because the company gives Lampert authority to invest excess money as he sees fit. Sears proposed buying Restoration Hardware for $6.75 per share, topping a management-led buyout of $6.70 to which Restoration had agreed earlier this month. Sears shares were down $13.99, or 12 percent, to $102.35 in Nasdaq afternoon trading after earlier touching $98.25 -- their lowest level since the company began trading as Sears Holdings in March 2005. As of Wednesday\\'s close, the stock had fallen 30 percent year-to-date.

      "{'text': ' The Federal Reserve will act to protect the wider economy from financial turmoil but not to shelter individual investors from losses, Fed Board Governor Frederic Mishkin said on Thursday. \\n\\n \"The fact that people lose money is just fine with me as long as I do my job of keeping the economy on an even keel,\" Mishkin said after a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology outside Boston. \"People are supposed to lose money when they do stupid things. We actually still need to respond if there is an effect on the credit markets, because aggregate demand is going to go down,\" he said in response to a question. The U.S. central bank has lowered interest rates by 75 basis points since mid-September to 4.5 percent and investors expect them to cut by at least another quarter point at their next meeting, on December 11, amid renewed market tension. Mishkin said in his speech that the decision would be driven by what happens in the economy over the next two weeks. \"The near-term path of interest rates is highly uncertain and depends on the implications of the incoming data, which in some cases are evolving right up to the time of the (Fed\\'s interest rate-setting) meeting,\" Mishkin said. Critics complain the Fed\\'s rate cuts since credit markets nearly seized up in August has just bailed out rich investors, while leaving ordinary people to pay the price through higher inflation down the line. Mishkin said this was short-sighted. \"People say you should not respond at all (to market losses). Guys who\\'ve made a mistake -- kill them. But if I am killing the economy at the same time, clearly I have actually done a very bad job in terms of fulfilling the mandate.\" The Fed by law must pursue both low and stable inflation and the maximum level of sustainable growth and employment. Global financial market turmoil sparked by the collapse of the U.S. subprime market has challenged policymakers to cushion growth at a time when rising energy and food prices could pressure inflation. Fed forecasts for growth and inflation through 2010 announced last week demonstrate that policy-makers would not try to abruptly lower inflation to the rate they consider optimal, Mishkin said. \"The recent high level of overall inflation reflects rapidly rising energy prices that the Federal Reserve obviously cannot control,\" he said. \"Any attempt to bring overall inflation down too quickly would entail large losses of output and employment,\" he added.

RealtyTrac said the national foreclosure rate was one filing for every 555 U.S. households in October. \"Overall foreclosure activity continues to register at a high level compared to last year but it appears to have leveled off over the past two months after hitting a high for the year in August,\" James Saccacio, chief executive officer of RealtyTrac, said in a statement. In September, home foreclosure filings fell 8 percent. Default rates in the subprime segment of the U.S. mortgage market, which caters to borrowers with poor credit histories, have jumped this year as the housing industry slowed and prices fell in many regions, particularly areas that benefited the most during the housing market\\'s boom from 2000 to 2005. \"Default notices were down nearly 9 percent in October, indicating that some of the efforts on the part of homeowners, lenders and advocacy groups to find alternatives to foreclosure may be starting to have an impact. On the other hand, bank repossessions were up nearly 35 percent, evidence that more homeowners who enter foreclosure are losing their homes,\" Saccacio said. Nevada, once one of the hottest real estate markets and a favorite among investors, led the nation with one foreclosure filing for every 154 households, 3.6 times the national average. Its 6,618 filings were up 20 percent from September and were nearly triple those reported in October 2006.

      "{'text': ' E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ) is getting a $2.55 billion cash infusion from investors led by Citadel Investment Group, which is also buying the mortgage-related securities portfolio that has been the primary source of the discount brokerage\\'s recent woes. \\n\\n Chicago-based Citadel, which often invests in troubled assets and companies, will gain about 18 percent ownership of E*Trade and a board seat, E*Trade said on Thursday. E*Trade shares, which have lost about 80 percent since January, surged at first on news of the deal but wound up falling 46 cents, or 8.7 percent, to close at $4.82 on Nasdaq, as investors soured on a deal that didn\\'t meet expectations. BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), the largest publicly traded U.S. asset manager, is also an investor in the Citadel bail-out, E*Trade said. Mitch Caplan, E*Trade chief executive since 2003, is stepping down, the company said. Donald Layton, a former vice chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) who has been advising the brokerage, will become E*Trade\\'s chairman. Jarrett Lilien, now chief operating officer, will become acting chief executive. The deal includes immediate funding of about $2.4 billion and rids E*Trade of its troubled $3 billion asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolio. Citadel will pay $800 million for the portfolio. Another component of the deal is the purchase of $1.75 billion worth of 10-year notes and stock that will pay an annual interest rate of about 12.5 percent, E*Trade said. E*Trade said it will take a fourth-quarter pretax charge of $2.2 billion as a result of the portfolio sale. It will also increase its allowance for bad home equity loans to $400 million and will issue common stock equal to about 20 percent of its outstanding shares. LUMP OF COAL \"Citadel is the clear winner in this transaction,\" Bank of America analyst Michael Hecht said in a research note titled \"Xmas comes early for Citadel, shareholders get lump of coal.\" Hecht said Citadel\\'s deal gives it a $3 billion asset-backed securities book for 27 cents on the dollar and $1.75 billion of secured paper at 12.5 percent -- and 84 million shares of stock \"for nothing.\" Hecht said shareholders, in contrast, \"suffer (more than) 40 percent earnings per share dilution and 100 percent tangible equity dilution.\" After E*Trade took large losses in its mortgage segment, analysts said it would have to pursue strategic alternatives, such as the sale of some assets or a takeover by larger rivals like Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.O or TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ( AMTD.O ). E*Trade said it considered a tie-up with a peer company but the Citadel deal appeared best. Analysts were not convinced. \"Shareholders missed an opportunity for a sale of the company that would have been $10 (or more) (per) share,\" said David Trone, an analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller. He added that E*Trade was \"a no-growth story\" and cut his price target for the company from $7.50 to $6.00 a share. Option traders also reacted. \"They are liquidating some of their long call positions as the takeover speculation fades. Every call premium is down hard,\" Lefkowitz said. \"For example, both the December $7 and $6 call premiums are down more than 40 percent in value,\" said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. CEO SEARCH The company, one of the largest U.S. online bank and brokerages, said it will search for a new CEO. Acting chief Lilien, who has been with E*Trade since 1999, will be considered along with external candidates. Lilien said in an interview that he was the only candidate so far. Departing CEO Caplan will retain a seat on the board and have an advisory role, E*Trade said. E*Trade, best known for its brokerage business, in recent years diversified into mortgages, mortgage securities and other lending areas. That paid off until earlier this year, when the company was hit by large losses in its mortgage business. Lilien said the Citadel deal allows it to get its troubled portfolio off its books and provides much-needed cash. And he said the company plans to stick with its two-pronged business model, offering brokerage and banking services to customers. The board had considered about 40 different transactions, he added, declining to be more specific. \"Our belief is that our business is in great shape,\" he said. \"Our strategy we feel was on target -- it was our balance sheet that had the issues.\" E*Trade earlier this month withdrew its financial outlook for 2007. Lilien said the company did not plan to issue financial forecasts at least through the end of the year. E*Trade disclosed that retail client assets have fallen 15 percent in the month, but Lilien said it hopes to win back much of that business. As of November 27, retail client assets were $192 billion compared with $226.7 billion on October 31. The company has historically issued financial metrics on a monthly basis, but on a conference call with investors it said it will now only make quarterly disclosures.

      "{'text': ' A deadly explosion on a Enbridge Inc. pipeline in Minnesota occurred during routine repairs and was not the result of weakened or corroded pipe, company executives said on Thursday. \\n\\n Workers were wrapping up repair work on a section of pipe on the system\\'s Line 3 near Clearbrook, Minnesota, when the oil spilled and ignited, Enbridge Vice-President Leon Zupan told reporters during a conference call. Three weeks earlier, the section had sprung a \"pinhole\" leak, which led to \"a couple barrels\" squirting out, but that did not force Enbridge to shut the line down, Zupan said. Instead, crews put a temporary repair sleeve over that section to keep crude moving. On Wednesday, workers shut the line down to cut out the damaged piece of pipe and replace it with a new, pretested section, using special couplings on both sides, he said. \"It was at the tail end of this repair and replacement process when we restarted Line 3 and we ended up with the release from the line through one of these fittings,\" Zupan said. Executives said crews are still investigating the cause of the explosion and fire at the site. The blast killed two pipeline maintenance workers who lived in the Superior, Wisconsin, area. Company officials said they would not release their identities until the families gave their approval to do so. The incident was the second involving Line 3 this year. In April, the line ruptured near Glenavon, Saskatchewan, spilling 3,750 barrels. Unlike Wednesday\\'s incident, the break did not occur during maintenance. Enbridge was forced to run the line at 80 percent of capacity into the summer. Line 3 is expected to be back in service in the next two or three days. Enbridge\\'s other three adjacent pipelines in the area resumed service on Thursday. Executives said the Minnesota incident was not the result of inexperienced staff conducting dangerous work. \"All of the employees that were involved in this incident were fully trained and qualified to do their tasks, so it\\'s not an issue of length of service here,\" Zupan said. Executives said they will co-operate with U.S. federal and state agencies to determine how the explosion occurred and will commit the necessary resources to make sure its system is safe. In response to a reporter\\'s question, Chief Executive Pat Daniel said he and his company were not agonizing over whether the tragedy might damage Enbridge\\'s reputation. \"This is an incident that has really shaken us in that it involves the death of two outstanding employees, and our concerns right now are not with the reputation of Enbridge but with the families of the two employees who were involved,\" Daniel said.

      "{'text': ' Dell Inc DELL.O warned on Thursday that the costs of restructuring and investment could \"adversely impact\" its performance, sending shares of the world\\'s second-largest personal computer maker down 8 percent. \\n\\n While the company reported greater-than-expected quarterly revenue growth and a 27 percent rise in profit, investors zeroed in on its rising costs and the cautious outlook. Net income for its fiscal third quarter ended November 2 grew to $766 million, or 34 cents per share, from $601 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $15.65 billion from $14.42 billion, whereas analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $15.36 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Dell booked costs of $50 million, or 2 cents per share, related to job cuts and asset disposals, plus $28 million, or 1 cent per share, for a year-long accounting audit. Several analysts said its earnings were in line with expectations after factoring out one-time items, a disappointment given the strong revenue performance. \"The bottom line is that people were disappointed. People expected more than they got,\" said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates of Concord, Massachusetts. Revenue from servers used by businesses to run networks and Web sites rose 8 percent to $1.6 billion. Data-storage system revenue also rose 8 percent, to $600 million. Revenue from laptop computers rose 19 percent to $4.7 billion while desktop revenue fell 1 percent to $4.8 billion. Industrywide, global PC shipments grew 16 percent in the third quarter, helped by rising notebook sales at retailers outside the United States, researcher IDC said in October. Dell is facing increasing competition from Asian rivals including Acer Inc ( 2353.TW ) and Lenovo Group Ltd ( 0992.HK ) in the United States, which accounts for the majority of Dell\\'s sales. The company, hoping to compete better with larger rival Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) and Asian competitors, in June began selling PCs in stores for the first time after 23 years of direct-only sales via phone or Internet. It has started selling PCs in Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) in North America and GOME Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd ( 0493.HK ) in China, and announced this week plans to sell computers in France, Spain and Belgium through France\\'s Carrefour SA ( CARR.PA ), the world\\'s second-largest retailer. Like rivals, Round Rock, Texas-based Dell has been helped by falling prices for computer memory and other components and by strong PC demand in U.S. back-to-school sales and pre-holiday gift spending. But Dell said restructuring costs related to ongoing job reductions, investments in the business and acquisitions \"may adversely impact the company\\'s performance.\" Also, a slowing decline in component costs and a seasonal product-mix shift to U.S. consumer and international regions may also hurt results, Dell said. Dell shares fell 7.8 percent to $25.93 in extended trading following the earnings report, after adding 1.6 percent to close at $28.14 on Nasdaq. The stock, up 10 percent in 2007 through Wednesday, trades at 19 times estimated earnings per share for its fiscal year ending in January, compared with 17 for HP\\'s fiscal year ended in October and IBM\\'s ( IBM.N ) 2007 multiple of 15.

German critics of bailing out over-indebted members of the euro zone such as Greece call this process a \\'transfer union\\', whereby fiscally-disciplined countries like Germany pay for the excessive debts and deficits of their European partners. \"You can\\'t have one without the other -- that is the price of the euro,\" said Fischer, who was a strong advocate of Europe as foreign minister from 1998-2005, when his Greens shared power with Gerhard Schroeder\\'s Social Democrats (SPD). Fischer, a sharp critic of conservative leader Merkel\\'s leadership in the sovereign debt crisis, said her government was always doing \"too little, too late. Which means the solutions to the debt crisis are getting more and more costly.\" Merkel should stop resisting calls from financial markets and foreign governments to back a stronger role for the European Central Bank and to jointly-issued euro zone bonds, the former Greens politician said. \"At the moment there is no perfect solution,\" said Fischer, who has retired from German politics and became a consultant to the Nabucco gas pipeline project in 2009. His old party and the SPD back the idea of euro bonds -- which Merkel says would just remove the incentive for states to reign in debts and spending by leveling off interest rates and could threaten the top credit rating of countries like Germany. However none of Germany\\'s parliamentary parties currently dare to question the central tenet of an independent ECB, which Germans consider the best defense against the hyperinflation that the country suffered between the two world wars. Merkel\\'s current focus in the euro crisis - beyond urging the implementation of decisions to boost the euro-zone bailout fund and recapitalize banks - is to seek fiscal discipline via centralized monitoring of the budgets of European states. This would require what she touts as \"limited treaty changes\" enabling countries to cede some sovereignty to the European Union\\'s executive Commission, which would appoint a \"Budget Commissioner\" and impose sanctions on rule breakers. Fischer said what Europe needed was a massive handover of sovereignty to Brussels, in order to convince financial markets that the bloc is serious about defending the euro. \"So far in the crisis the markets have been in the driving seat, because they didn\\'t believe politicians would face up to the consequences of having a common currency and say where they wanted to go,\" said Fischer. With an agreement among all 27 EU members unlikely, Fischer said, the 17 euro members should agree treaty changes among themselves to create \"an avant-garde, a vanguard.\" (Writing by  Stephen Brown ; Editing by Rosalind Russell)', 'date': ' Fri Nov 25, 2011 10:34am EST\\n', 'title': ' Fischer urges Germany to pay price of saving euro\\n', 'author': ' By Andreas Rinke\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/25/us-eurozone-germany-fischer-idUSTRE7AO0YI20111125\\n\\n \\n\\n BERLIN  ('}\n",

In a second incident, off-duty officers in North Carolina used pepper spray to subdue rowdy shoppers waiting for electronics. A man was in critical but stable condition after being shot by robbers in a parking lot outside a Walmart In San Leandro, California, at 1:50 a.m. (0950 GMT), Sergeant Mike Sobek said. The man was in a group of men headed for their car after shopping when robbers confronted them and a fight ensued, Sobek said. The man\\'s shopping companions held down one of the robbers until police arrived and took him into custody. \"It doesn\\'t look like they got away with anything. They weren\\'t expecting these guys to fight back,\" Sobek said. In Los Angeles, authorities were reviewing security tapes to track down a woman in her 30s who pepper-sprayed a crowd at a Walmart as customers swarmed for Xboxes on sale late Thursday, Los Angeles police Sergeant J. Valle said. \"They were opening a package to try to get some Xboxes from a crate and this lady pepper-sprayed a whole bunch of people in order to gain an advantage over the Xboxes,\" Valle said. Black Friday is the busiest day of the year for U.S. stores. \\'SENSELESS ACT\\' Off-duty police officers working as security for a Walmart in Kinston, North Carolina, used pepper spray to keep anxious shoppers at bay before the start of an electronics sale at midnight on Thursday, authorities said. The already \"rowdy\" atmosphere intensified when employees began to bring out pallets of electronic merchandise, Kinston director of public safety Bill Johnson said. When customers tried to grab merchandise from the pallets before the sale time, the off-duty officers hired as store security guards for the event discharged pepper spray to restore order, Johnson said. One man was arrested for failing to follow officers\\' orders, he said. \"No one was pepper sprayed in the face,\" Johnson said, adding that he was unaware of any injuries. Walmart is the U.S. discount store unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. A company spokesman, Greg Rossiter, said violence at a handful of stores marred an otherwise safe start to the holiday shopping season at thousands of Walmart stores. The San Leandro shooting \"was a senseless act of violence and our thoughts and prayers are with the customer and his family during this difficult time,\" Rossiter said. In another incident, a woman was shot in the foot by a robber who accosted her in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, early on Friday demanding her purse as she and companions put their purchases into a car trunk near a Walmart, police said. The shopper was hospitalized. Her condition was not known. A Cave Creek, Arizona, Walmart was evacuated and shopping halted temporarily Thursday night after an apparent explosive device was found in an employee break room, Maricopa County Sheriff\\'s Department spokesman Christopher Hegstrom said. \"We sent a robot in,\" Hegstrom said, adding that the device was removed and the store was reopened after bomb squad dogs were sent through the facility. In Manhattan, a group of shoppers upset that Hollister\\'s flagship store was not opening at midnight like other locations apparently broke into the store and stole a large quantity of clothing, police said. No arrests have been made in the burglary.

      "{'text': ' Credit rating agency Moody\\'s cut Hungary\\'s debt to \"junk\" grade late on Thursday, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Viktor Orban\\'s unorthodox economic policies and prompting his government to denounce the move as a \"financial attack.\" \\n Moody\\'s lowered Hungary\\'s sovereign rating by one notch to Ba1, just below investment grade, with a negative outlook, hours after rival Standard & Poor\\'s held fire on a flagged downgrade after Budapest said it would seek international aid. The move followed warnings from all three major ratings agencies that Orban\\'s policies, which have eschewed traditional austerity in favor of revenue-boosting steps like a special bank tax and the nationalization of $14 billion in pension assets, had put Hungary\\'s finances at risk. It also came after Orban relaunched aid talks this week with the International Monetary Fund, a dramatic reversal after he cut cooperation with the Fund short last year after sweeping a 2010 election on a vow to regain \"economic sovereignty.\" Moody\\'s cited rising uncertainty about Hungary\\'s ability to meet fiscal goals, high debt levels and what it called increasingly constrained medium-term growth prospects. \"Moody\\'s believes that the combined impact of these factors will adversely impact the government\\'s financial strength and erode its shock-absorption capacity,\" it said in a statement. Hungarian bond yields soared by about a full percentage point, lifting its entire bond curve above 9 percent, but yields dropped by about 20-30 basis points in afternoon trade as high yields prompted buyers to enter the market. The cost of insuring Hungarian debt against default jumped to new record highs at 635 basis points, eclipsing earlier highs hit in March 2009. The forint rebounded from morning falls of about 1.6 percent to trade at 314.10 by 1259 GMT. The Czech crown fell to a 17-month low and the Polish zloty dipped beyond the 4.50 per euro level and briefly approached a 27-month low of 4.537 hit in September. Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said that although most of central and Eastern Europe was better off than southern Europe, fears over the euro zone debt crisis and the Hungarian downgrade indicated turmoil ahead. \"There\\'s no question that sentiment toward the region is deteriorating rapidly and that even the most resilient economies are in for a rough ride in the months ahead,\" he said. SHORT-LIVED SURPLUS The downgrade is a major setback for Orban, whose Fidesz party ousted Socialists he has blamed for economic mismanagement by winning a two-thirds majority in last year\\'s election. He has cut taxes for families and small firms and raised tariffs on banks, utilities and other big, mainly foreign-owned, firms, putting the country of 10 million on track to run one of the European Union\\'s only budget surpluses this year. But his policies have failed to spur growth and irked voters who resent his aggressive tactics and oppose his seizing private pension savings to fund an inefficient public sector. The government\\'s unpredictability and rising pressure from the euro zone crisis have hammered investor sentiment. The forint has fallen 16.3 percent since July 1, versus 12.6 percent for its regional peer the Polish zloty and 6.7 percent for the Czech crown. The Economy Ministry has blamed the currency\\'s plummet -- which has hit Hungarians who have borrowed in foreign currency -- on market speculators. It said the downgrade was unwarranted, the latest in a string of \"financial attacks against Hungary.\" \"Obviously, the forint\\'s weakening is not justified by either the performance of the Hungarian economy, or the shape of the budget,\" the Economy Ministry said in a statement. The government cited its commitment to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent of economic output next year, 1 percent of GDP\\'s worth of reserves in the 2012 budget, and an expected decline in debt levels, as arguments against the rating cut. But Moody\\'s said the government\\'s 2.5 percent of GDP budget deficit target for next year may be difficult to meet due to high funding costs and low economic growth. The weak forint pushed Hungary\\'s government debt to 82 percent of economic output by the end of the third quarter, undoing the impact of Orban\\'s $14 billion pension asset grab. Hungary must roll over 4.7 billion euros in external debt next year as it starts repaying part of its 20 billion euros, 2008 bailout from the IMF -- something that could be solved with a new financing deal. In his unexpected about face on potential IMF support, Orban made clear that he would not accept any demands in exchange for cash at the ready should the need arise. but Moody\\'s said the request to resume talks illustrated Budapest\\'s funding challenges. \"Even with such an arrangement, the government\\'s debt structure will remain vulnerable to shocks in the medium term, which are inconsistent with a Baa3 rating,\" Moody\\'s said. \"SAFETY NET\" The European Commission forecasts the economy will expand by only 0.5 percent at most next year, far lower than the 3 percent initially forecast in Orban\\'s medium-term budget plan. Complicating that further is high unemployment, weak bank lending and 5 trillion forints in mostly Swiss franc denominated foreign currency mortgages which have seen repayments soar due to the franc\\'s strength and forint\\'s slide. Orban has introduced an option for families to repay loans at exchange rates below market levels, but that has roiled markets and inflicted billions of forints of losses on the bank sector, undermining growth and lending. Economists said the gloomy economic outlook could combine with the downgrade and increase pressure on Budapest to accept an IMF deal with the monitoring and policy recommendations Orban has spurned. \"As the economy will tumble into recession by around the turn of the year, we expect that it will have no other choice than to accept any IMF proposal, even if this would include conditionalities,\" said Michal Dybula at BNP Paribas. Moody\\'s said it would further lower Hungary\\'s rating if there was a significant decline in government financial strength due to a lack of progress on structural reforms and implementation of a medium-term plan. The ratings cut came just hours after S&P deferred its decision on a possible downgrade of Hungary to non-investment grade until end-February, pending IMF talks. Fitch, another rating agency which has Hungary in the lowest investment-grade category, has said an agreement on a new IMF program could reduce downward pressure on Hungary\\'s rating.

      "{'text': ' Exchange operator CME Group Inc ( CME.O ) fined Infinium Capital Management, a U.S. high-frequency trading firm, a total of $850,000 for three separate computer malfunctions that rattled futures markets in 2009 and 2010. \\n Infinium trading programs malfunctioned on October 7 and again on October 28, 2009, causing uncontrolled selling of e-mini contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Then on February 3, 2010, the firm lost control of an algorithm that bought oil futures in rapid succession on the New York Mercantile Exchange. CME, which runs both exchanges, charged the firm on Friday for \"acts detrimental\" to the marketplace in the October incident, for improper identification in the February incident and for failing to supervise its activities in both cases. Reuters reported the oil-futures algorithm malfunction and CME investigation last year. Infinium\\'s buying on February 3 sparked a frenzied $1 surge in oil prices late that day as the computer program sent thousands of orders per second, racking up a million-dollar loss for the firm. Infinium neither admitted not denied the rule violations, CME said in separate disciplinary notices. High-frequency firms rely on rapid-fire trades and short-term strategies to make markets and earn the spreads on fleeting price imbalances. Although these firms add much liquidity to securities, they have been criticized by some for destabilizing markets and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is considering new rules that could rein them in. Infinium, run by Chief Executive Charles Whitman, is a household name in Chicago\\'s trading community and a member of the Futures Industry Association\\'s Principal Traders Group, a lobby group for high-frequency traders. CME found that Infinium errantly sold 6,958 December-dated e-mini Nasdaq 100 Index futures over seven seconds early on October 28. The firm later contacted the exchange about the problem, resulting in price changes in 763 contracts. A similar malfunction with the same so-called automated trading system happened on October 7, although Infinium \"took no further action to correct, modify, or disable\" it before October 28, CME said. Those two incidents resulted in a $500,000 fine. The malfunction on the NYMEX - which involved the trading of an exchange-traded fund called United States Oil Fund and the U.S. crude benchmark future, West Texas Intermediate - resulted in a $350,000 fine. CME said that, in that instance, Infinium used an algorithm in the open market that had been created the previous night with only one to two hours of back-testing. Greg Eickbush, Infinium\\'s chief operating officer, said it was likely the largest fine handed down for a nonfraudulent human error in this market. \"I think that just represents the times and the current environment more than anything else,\" he said of the sharp scrutiny of high-frequency trading. \"We didn\\'t want to be on the precedent-setting end of any fines, however we do understand the importance of keeping the marketplace as transparent and as trustworthy as possible,\" Eickbush added. \"We haven\\'t had a problem since, nor do we see any problems in the future.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; editing by  Tim Dobbyn  and  Andre Grenon )', 'date': ' Fri Nov 25, 2011 5:47pm EST\\n', 'title': ' High-frequency firm fined for trading malfunctions\\n', 'author': ' By  Jonathan Spicer\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/25/us-cme-infinium-fine-idUSTRE7AO1Q820111125\\n\\n \\n\\n ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Italy paid a record 6.5 percent to borrow money over six months on Friday and its longer-term funding costs soared far above levels seen as sustainable for public finances, raising the pressure on Rome\\'s new emergency government. \\n The auction yield on the six-month paper almost doubled compared to a month earlier, capping a week in which a German bond auction came close to failing and the leaders of Germany, France and Italy failed to make progress on crisis resolution measures. Though Italy managed to raise the full planned amount of 10 billion euros, weakening demand and the highest borrowing costs since it joined the euro frightened investors, pushing Italian stocks lower and bond yields to record highs on the secondary market. Yields on two-year BTP bonds soared to more than 8 percent in response, a euro lifetime high, despite reported purchases by the European Central Bank. In a sign of intense market stress, it now costs more to borrow for two years than 10 on the secondary market and borrowing costs for whatever term are above the 7 percent threshold, over which Italy is likely to need outside help if they do not subside. \"The pricing is awful,\" said Padhraic Garvey, rate strategist with Dutch bank ING in Amsterdam. \"The object of the exercise this morning was to get the job done and they\\'ve done that, but that\\'s about the only positive thing to say.\" Investors\\' attention will now turn to a bond sale of up to 8 billion euros that Italy is planning for next Tuesday. \"For the BTP auctions next week, we\\'ll have more of the same they\\'ll probably get it done at a concession,\" Garvey said. Italy\\'s new technocrat government, which took power last week, is at work on structural reforms to revive the stagnant economy but markets are looking for quick and effective responses from European policymakers, such as a greater involvement of the European Central Bank. Traders said the ECB was buying Italian and Spanish bonds in an attempt to shore the market up. But given its reluctance to prop up high-debt euro zone governments, its bond-buying program has been conducted intermittently, and never powerfully enough to provide more than short-term stability. New Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said short-term measures to tame Italy\\'s budget deficit would not be enough to solve the country\\'s economic problems and only structural reforms will generate growth. At an annual average rate of just 0.3 percent over the past decade, the Italian economy has grown faster than only a handful of other countries across the world. Real purchasing power has fallen 4 percent in 10 years. BIG SPRING DEBT BILLS Since being thrust to the fore of the euro zone crisis in July, Italy has always managed to attract sufficient demand at its auctions. But record high yields threaten Rome\\'s planned gross issuance of 440 billion euros for 2012 as interest payments on the country\\'s 1.9 trillion euro debt pile rise. Analysts say that, at current yield levels, the euro zone third-largest economy risks losing market access as redemptions totaling a massive 150 billion euros for the February-April period approach. The euro, already trading around a seven-week low, inched down after Friday\\'s auction. European stock markets remained in negative territory for the day with the Milan stock-market the worst performer. The six-month yield nearly doubled from an auction level of 3.5 percent a month ago. By comparison, Spain paid 5.2 percent to sell six-month paper at a much smaller short-term auction earlier this week, after elections handed power to an austerity-committed conservative government. Italy also sold 2 billion euros of zero-coupon CTZ bonds at a euro era record high yield of 7.8 percent, up from 4.6 percent at the previous sale.

However Rehn said the idea faced considerable skepticism in Germany, the euro zone\\'s largest economy, where many voters fear they will be forced to subsidize what are widely seen as fiscally irresponsible southern states. \"If I put it nicely, I would say there is a variety of views and there is quite some opposition as regards (common) euro bonds,\" Rehn said in testimony held in Italy\\'s Chamber of Deputies. \"It will take quite some effort before the German public and the public in some other member states will be convinced of the merits of euro bonds.\" Rehn said it was clear from his talks with governments in Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and other states that euro bonds could only be adopted at the end of a process of much deeper economic union. \"The necessary pre-condition for any serious move (on euro zone bonds) is further reinforcement of economic government toward a fiscal union,\" he said. However, he underlined the need for a \"community method\" in building this fiscal union, rather than \"directorates of two countries or more,\" and stressed that Germany would have to co-operate with its partners. \"As Mrs Merkel wants to decide a fiscal union, the German government will have the pleasure to negotiate with the other 26 members of the EU and the other 16 members of the euro zone, as well as the Commission ... when decisions of fiscal union and economic union are taken,\" he said. The debt crisis now ravaging the euro zone shows the error of launching Europe\\'s economic and monetary union without a solid economic foundation, Rehn said.

      "{'text': ' Belgium\\'s political deadlock sparked a downgrade in its debt on Friday, possibly forcing the country to pay higher interest rates as it nears 18 months without a formal government. \\n Standard & Poor\\'s downgraded Belgium\\'s credit rating to double-A from double-A-plus, citing concerns about funding and market pressures, as the euro zone debt crisis continues to worsen. \"We need a reply that is clear and credible if we are to avoid the worst,\" Belgium\\'s caretaker prime minister, Yves Leterme, told Belgian television immediately after S&P\\'s announcement. The downgrade followed difficulties this week in Belgium\\'s drawn-out attempt to form a government. Elio Di Rupo, leader of the French-speaking Socialists, had been trying to form a government based on a six-party coalition. But he tendered his resignation on Monday after talks for a 2012 budget - agreement on which is a condition for forming a government - ground to a halt. \"The announcement by Standard & Poor\\'s reinforces further the necessity to finalize the 2012 budget in a very brief period,\" Finance Minister Didier Reynders said in a statement. Economists said that the downgrade might force the political parties to forge an agreement over the weekend, but that this would still be too late for the country to avoid higher borrowing costs. \"Even if they have an agreement tonight we will have to pay higher interest rates due to the lower rating,\" said Philippe Ledent, an economist at Bank Degroof. In its statement, S&P said: \"We think the Belgian government\\'s capacity to prevent an increase in general government debt, which we consider to be already at high levels, is being constrained by rapid private sector deleveraging both in Belgium and among many of Belgium\\'s key trading partners.\" Barclays Capital economist Francois Cabau pointed out that Belgium had been on a negative outlook for a year, so the announcement was not big news. \"I guess they saw enough in terms of the political uncertainty,\" he said. Reynders said that Belgium\\'s credit rating was still one of the most solid in Europe, and that its heavy debt burden was already heading downwards. Though Belgium\\'s outstanding debt is nearly as big as its gross domestic product, making it one of the most indebted countries in Europe, the country\\'s budget deficit is forecast to be relatively low this year at 3.6 percent. The six parties involved in the budget talks are aiming at a budget deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP for next year, but have failed to agree how much of the savings should come from higher taxes and how much from public spending cuts. The budget wrangling and a wider loss of confidence in European sovereign debt have pushed up Belgium\\'s borrowing costs sharply. At the end of September, the yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds was under 3.9 percent. On Friday, it was up to 5.9 percent. Belgium\\'s downgrade followed another rough week in European sovereign debt markets. Italy paid a record 6.5 percent to borrow money over six months on Friday, raising the pressure on Rome\\'s new emergency government. The S&P announcement is a sign of \"further deterioration across the euro zone,\" said Mark Luschini, chief market strategist in Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \"The threat is creeping closer to the core member. It\\'s evident that their situation is untenable.\" (Reporting By Sebastian Moffett. Additional reporting by  Alexandria Sage  in Paris and  Richard Leong  in New York.

      "{'text': ' Fund managers keen to cash in on the cult of celebrity are being warned high-profile, pricey marketing campaigns in today\\'s tough economic times could lose them more business than they win. \\n Soccer manager Jose Mourinho recently joined the roster of Hollywood stars and sporting legends hired by banks and insurers to promote their brands, signing up last month to represent funds firm Henderson Group. Against the backdrop of industry job cuts, sluggish business and flatlining fund fees however, this kind of spending may backfire, say financial advisors and corporate governance groups. \"The use of celebrities can be damaging as well as helpful especially as the link between celebrity and company can be tenuous to say the least,\" said Tom Biggar, investment manager at TQInvest. \"It may become a hindrance as clients express interest in products that are completely inappropriate for them.\" Henderson\\'s campaign is designed to project unity and strength after two recent buyouts. But spending vast sums on marketing that may be more geared to boosting internal morale than luring new clients could alienate cost-conscious investors expecting to see far more bang for their buck. Henderson recently reported retail investors, spooked by the Euro crisis, withdrew 692 million pounds more from their funds than they put in during the three months to September 30. \"You can understand why Henderson would like the public to equate the firm with Mourinho - \\'the special one\\' - and his endorsement may be quite compelling if Mourinho limits the number of companies he pitches,\" Simon Wong, a partner in active investment firm Governance for Owners said. \"Whether the Mourinho deal is justifiable depends on, among other things, the amount paid to him and the expected payback measured in terms of increased name recognition of the firm, reputational impact and success in growing revenues from the targeted segments,\" he said. Mourinho signed up as the new face of Braun\\'s Series 7 electric razors in September and has also fronted financial sector campaigns for American Express and more recently Portugal\\'s Millennium Bank, in which he urged fellow countrymen to be proud of their country despite its economic difficulties. Richard Wilson, Henderson sales & marketing director, said his company was delighted with its \"excellent value\" arrangement with the Real Madrid coach but conceded it would be tough to pinpoint how much new cash he could help Henderson bring in. \"It\\'s clear Henderson has been through a period of change and is now rallying around the idea of having a common objective,\" Wilson said. Pete Davis, founder of Getmemedia.com, a search service for marketing ideas, who in the past managed sponsorships at Swiss foods group Nestle, estimates endorsement by a well known personality could be worth about 1-2 million pounds to the individual. By comparison, sponsorship of a Formula 1 racing team could cost around 25 million pounds. British insurer Aviva ruffled feathers among its investors with its 10 million pound celebrity-backed rebranding of unit Norwich Union in 2009, at a time when the reputation of financial services firms was languishing in the doldrums. Some shareholders used the forum of that year\\'s annual general meeting to accuse Aviva of overspending on the campaign, which featured actor Bruce Willis and supermodel Elle Macpherson, but Chief Marketing Officer Amanda Mackenzie said time has underlined just how effective the tactic was. \"Our television advertisements, featuring famous people who had all changed their names, showed how this had helped them achieve a change in fame and fortune. Using celebrities is a proven way of gaining high impact fast, so you ultimately spend less on media buying,\" Mackenzie said. \"Media costs were also lower at the time we rebranded due to the economic downturn and we benefited from billboard advertising staying up beyond the period we\\'d paid for.\" Davis suggested the financial crisis may have driven the cost of celebrity endorsement for fund managers and banks higher because of caution on the part of the stars about being associated with institutions seen by the public as villains. \"Quite often now... celebrities will turn things down because they don\\'t think the fit is right or they don\\'t think the brand is moral enough. They don\\'t necessarily need the money at the top level, so they can pick and choose,\" said Getmemedia.com\\'s Davis. Although the campaigns are likely to generate a spike in interest in financial services firms in the short term, advisors said they seldom lead directly to a product sale, particularly with so many other factors influencing fund selection. \"I can honestly say that this should have absolutely no impact upon an advisor\\'s decision when recommending suitable investments to clients, and any suggestion otherwise is incorrect,\" TQInvest\\'s Biggar said.

      "{'text': ' India\\'s move to open its supermarket sector to foreign investors brought relief to its capital-starved local chains but failed to impress small-shop owners who dominate retail in the country, despite rules intended to safeguard small operators. \\n New Delhi approved its biggest reform in years by allowing global supermarket giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Tesco to enter India with a 51 percent stake in the hope it would attract capital to build much-needed supply chains and improve efficiency to alleviate food-driven inflation. \"This is an extremely important step for domestic retailers as this will get in much-needed capital, apart from domain knowledge,\" said Thomas Varghese, chief executive of Aditya Birla Retail. Chain stores account for just 6 percent of a $500 billion retail market dominated by street stalls and corner shops. Many Indian chains are cash-strapped and loss-making, struggling to build scale given high costs, poor supply chains and scarce real estate and have been eyeing equity investments and joint venture partnerships with global firms to build scale. Vijay Karwal, head of consumer, retail and healthcare for Asia at Royal Bank of Scotland based in Hong Kong expects more than $5 billion in foreign investment into the Indian retail sector over the next five to seven years. Given the relative lack of modern retail infrastructure in India, and particularly in the enabling back-end infrastructure ... the vast majority of investment this change is expected to trigger would be greenfield investment into new retail sites and infrastructure,\" he said. Shares in Indian retailers Pantaloon Retail, Shoppers Stop, Trent jumped -- bucking a fall in the wider stock market -- on expectations that they will form tie-ups with foreign players, and not just compete with them. Debashish Mukherjee, partner and vice-president at consultancy firm AT Kearney, expects joint ventures and investments in local players from overseas operators over the next six months. \"The set of transactions which will happen fast is foreign players who are in existing joint ventures with Indian firms, the increase or decrease in stake, will happen quickly,\" he said. \"The second are a set of deals that are waiting to happen and have been just waiting for the announcement.\" SMALL SHOPS UNHAPPY To appease opponents, the government said foreign stores will only be permitted in cities of more than 1 million -- of which India has more than 50 -- and individual states can decide whether to allow global players on to their patch. It also insists that foreign retailers source almost a third of their produce from small industries, invest at least $100 million in India and spend half of that on infrastructure such as cold storage and warehouses. Many small shop owners fear for their livelihoods. \"It will affect my business as families prefer going to air-conditioned stores with fancy packaged goods these days,\" said Vinod Jain, a 27-year-old small grocery shop owner in the Lower Parel neighborhood of central Mumbai. A trade group representing so-called \"kirana\" shop owners is planning protests. \"The move to let the foreign retailers in will most certainly lead to job losses,\" said Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders. \"They should have worked on some kind of protectionist mechanism for smaller traders before coming out with this policy,\" he said. Foreign retailers who welcomed the Indian government\\'s move to open the sector also view the entry conditions with caution. \"Some of the conditions look quite stringent.

      "{'text': ' Sprint Nextel may be forced to abandon the biggest advantage it has over its rivals - unlimited data services for a flat fee - because of heavy data users and a shortage of wireless airwaves. \\n Moreover, the increasing likelihood that AT&T\\'s plan to buy T-Mobile USA, the nation\\'s fourth-largest mobile operator, will fail may have the paradoxical result of making Sprint\\'s position even more untenable, according to analysts who follow all three companies. Sprint, the nation\\'s third-largest mobile service provider, is planning to upgrade its network with the latest mobile standard, Long Term Evolution. But it is launching that service with only half the wireless airwaves bigger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc have assigned, leading experts to suggest that the popularity of Sprint\\'s unlimited data plan could put a strain on the network or slow down Web surfing speeds. Sprint has assigned just 10 megahertz of spectrum for the launch compared with its rivals\\' 20 megahertz, analysts say. It will have to reassign airwaves being used for other services in order to expand its capacity for LTE. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, which cap data use to stem overcapacity issues brought on by heavy users, Sprint is the only big U.S. carrier still selling unlimited data for a flat fee to users of smartphones, including the Apple Inc iPhone, on its current network. \"It\\'s a very bare-bones implementation of LTE,\" said Tolaga Research analyst Phil Marshall. \"The risk is, if you don\\'t have headroom as your LTE subscriber base grows, then the speeds will go down.\" In that situation, Marshall does not see Sprint being able to continue to offer unlimited services. \"Unlimited is going to kill them,\" he said. \"I think they\\'re going to have to back off from the all-you-can-eat plan.\" Unlimited data is a strong selling point for Sprint, which has been struggling for years to retain customers. For Sprint to keep the marketing advantage it has over rivals, one option could be for it to institute usage caps that are considerably higher than those of its competitors. \"That\\'s a lever they can play if they run into being constrained,\" said an industry source who asked not to be named due to a lack of authorization to speak publicly. \"It\\'s inevitable that they will eventually have to put caps (on their data use).\" SPRINT: NO HEADACHE Sprint, which is spending $7 billion to upgrade its network to LTE by the end of 2013, says concerns about its capacity are overblown, arguing that advanced technology allows it to make the most of its spectrum resources. Bob Azzi, a Sprint executive in charge of the company\\'s network, said the company\\'s plans assume that it will keep its unlimited data service during the LTE rollout. \"I don\\'t consider it a headache,\" he told Reuters, \"We have a good understanding of the nature of those plans and what they do.\" Azzi added that the section of the 1,900 megahertz spectrum band Sprint has set aside for LTE is currently unused. He also plans to reallocate spectrum in its 800 megahertz band to use for the high-speed service by early 2014, provided it can secure regulatory approval to do so. That spectrum is currently being used by the aging iDen service Sprint hopes to shut down in mid-2013. Sprint is also in talks with Clearwire Corp, its majority-owned venture, about expanding their partnership to cover LTE. Sprint currently depends on Clearwire\\'s network for its fastest service based on WiMax technology, and the latest talks are aimed at allowing it to piggyback on Clearwire\\'s LTE to help it boost capacity in the \"hottest of hotspots\" by 2014 when Azzi says Sprint will need more capacity. But the future of Sprint\\'s tempestuous relationship with Clearwire is murky since it is not yet certain if Clearwire will raise the roughly $1 billion in new funding it needs to upgrade its network to LTE. Clearwire lost one-third of its value after Sprint said on October 7 that a bankruptcy filing by the company could be \"constructive.\" Clearwire shareholders again fled on November 18 after the company said it may skip a debt interest payment due December 1. Many analysts saw that pronouncement as a negotiating tactic to try to force Sprint\\'s hand into an agreement with favorable terms for Clearwire. SOAP OPERA One investment manager described the Clearwire/Sprint relationship as a \"soap opera\" that will end with an agreement because they are both heavily dependent on each other. \"In the short term Sprint doesn\\'t need them beyond (WiMax) but they do need them later,\" said the manager, who asked not to be named. Even if Sprint and Clearwire reach an agreement, however, Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett is skeptical about how much it would help because of the frequency Clearwire\\'s spectrum is on, which he said causes signal problems within buildings. \"Now that the person next to you at the conference table is surfing away on Verizon ... the shortcomings of Clearwire become painfully apparent,\" Moffett said. Moffett also noted that even if Clearwire upgrades its network, it will still have coverage for only about one-third of the U.S. population because it would need to raise a lot more funding than it is currently seeking to extend its network into new markets. Since Sprint has already had to tap capital markets for $4 billion in debt and needs up to $3 billion more in funding for its own network upgrade, analysts are skeptical it can come up with the money to help Clearwire expand further. \"What are you going to do with the (rest) of the United States? You can\\'t just limp around on one leg,\" said Moffett, who has a \"hold\" rating on Sprint due to the uncertainty around its strategy. The uncertainty around AT&T\\'s deal for T-Mobile USA is another big wrinkle in the Sprint story. On Thursday, AT&T withdrew its application for deal approval with the Federal Communications Commission, saying that it would focus on its legal battle with the Department of Justice. If that deal is approved, it leaves Sprint as a distant No. 4. But if it is blocked, as many analysts now expect, T-Mobile USA may look for another partner, according to the investment manager. Instead of forging a deal with Clearwire or Sprint, Moffett suggested that T-Mobile USA would instead turn to U.S. cable operators such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. Some investors had hoped these companies would come to Sprint\\'s aid as they are part-owners in Clearwire. But since the cable operators have unused spectrum in the same band as T-Mobile USA, Moffett suggested that the cable providers would instead create a partnership with that company if it has to abandon the AT&T deal. Sprint has loudly opposed the AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal, a position that Moffett said was against its best interests. \"Now Sprint loses its logical partners in the cable operators,\" said Moffett, who described a potential cable/T-Mobile deal as a \"match made in heaven.\" Moreover, some analysts said that the $6 billion breakup package AT&T will have to pay T-Mobile if the deal fails would make T-Mobile into a more formidable rival to Sprint in the market for cost-conscious mobile consumers. The uncertainty means that Sprint does not \"know exactly how desperate they are at any given point in time,\" said the investment manager, noting that Sprint\\'s $2.38 share price speaks volumes about investor confidence in the operator\\'s strategy. \"It shows there\\'s not a whole lot of faith out there that they\\'ll be able to successfully execute on these things,\\' this person said.

The dollar also climbed to a near eight-month high against the Swiss franc.> On Wall Street, stocks traded higher for most of an abbreviated session on hopes that \"Black Friday,\" the traditional start of the U.S. holiday shopping season, would support major retailers. But negative headlines out of Europe forced the market to concede gains just before the close. Fewer participants in U.S. markets after Thursday\\'s Thanksgiving holiday also made it difficult to counter the move lower. Stocks in Europe and other major exchanges also suffered their worst week in two months, although European shares ended the day up following Wall Street\\'s initial bounce. \"Trading remains cautious (since) the poor auction of German bonds mid-week raised concerns the debt crisis is spreading to Europe\\'s core,\" said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederick Ruffy. Investors\\' worries intensified after reports that Greece was demanding harsh conditions from creditors on a proposed bond swap -- critical to reduce its debt and save the euro. Banks represented by the Institute of International Finance agreed last month to write off the notional value of their Greek bondholdings by 50 percent to reduce Greece\\'s debt ratio to 120 percent of its gross domestic product by 2020. But Greece was demanding that its new bonds\\' net present value -- a measure of the current worth of future cash flows -- be cut to 25 percent, a far harsher measure than a number in the high 40s that banks had in mind, according to people briefed on the matter. Greece aside, Belgium also made it to investors\\' watch-list after Standard & Poors downgraded the country\\'s credit rating to AA from AA-plus, citing concerns about funding and market pressures. A European Union conference in Strasbourg produced little to soothe the markets\\' fears. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, after talks with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti on Thursday, agreed only to stop bickering in public over whether the European Central Bank should do more to resolve the crisis. \"The markets are going to continue to pressure the EU until they come up with a solution that is going to ease the crisis,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ AAA euro zone bond spreads:  link.reuters.com/xaw94s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> After a shortened session, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  finished down 25.77 points, or 0.23 percent, at 11,231.78.

The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 18.57 points, or 0.75 percent, at 2,441.51 For the week, the S&P was down 4.7 percent. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if the S&P tested the 1,150 level next week when traders get back to their desks,\" said Kevin Kruzenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets in Cleveland. The S&P last tested those levels on October 6. U.S. Treasuries prices also ended down as investors saw a late-day rally from Wednesday pushing U.S. yields too low amid speculation the ECB may intervene in an effort to stem contagion in the troubled euro zone. <US/> The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 23/32 in price, its yield at 1.96 percent versus Wednesday\\'s close of 1.88 percent Commodities also fell broadly, except for U.S. crude oil, which rose on the early strength in equities and stayed up even after stocks fell. <COM/WRAP> <O/R>.

German Bund futures also extended losses, reinforcing fears that debt contagion is starting to hurt the region\\'s soundest economy.

      "{'text': ' KPMG\\'S chairman on Friday called for a global set of standards for the auditing industry and said the Olympus Corp scandal in Japan reveals evidence of \"significant fraud.\" \\n Michael Andrew, the chairman, also outlined steps needed to improve the auditing industry in a in a speech entitled, \"Fraud, Financial Crises and the Future of the Big Four.\" He spoke to the Foreign Correspondents Club in Hong Kong. KPMG AZSA LLC audited Olympus for several years until 2009, when it was replaced by Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC. An internal document obtained by Reuters showed that the maker of cameras and medical equipment replaced KPMG after a dispute over how to account for some acquisitions. Andrew said he was constrained in what he could say about the Olympus scandal, although he did address the issue, saying that KPMG had done the right thing in the actions it took pertaining to the Japanese company. \"What is pretty evident to me is that it is a very, very significant fraud,\" he said, adding: \"We should wait for the Japanese authorities to disclose that. \"I think it is very hard to jump to the conclusion that it\\'s a corporate governance failure,\" he said. \"Regulation will never prevent corporate scandals,\" he added, saying that the amount of actual corporate frauds found globally is relatively \"tiny.\" Andrew also called for more coordinated regulatory oversight as auditing firms have found themselves caught between regulators wanting different rules and standards, such as the current issue facing the United States and China. He spoke of the difficulties in Europe, where accounting for Greek debt was not done according to a single set of standards by the parties involved. Andrew cited the case of France and Germany accounting for bonds using different figures. \"So how do you account for Greek debt?\" he asked, pointing out that the accounting standards should be the same. As for how that impacts the banks involved, that\\'s up to regulators to determine, he said. CHINA-U.S. STANDOFF The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the U.S. auditor watchdog, has been pushing to be allowed to inspect Chinese audit firms, but talks with authorities in Beijing appear to have stalled in recent months. In October, audit industry sources told Reuters that China\\'s financial authorities had asked the big audit firms to review their work on U.S.-listed Chinese companies and disclose any information they may have shared with overseas regulators. Andrew said that while this does not often happen, being caught between regulators in the United States and China in this instance makes auditing very difficult. He cited the need for global regulatory oversight to help avoid such cases. China has been one of the fastest-growing markets in the world for accounting firms, expanding by nearly 20 percent in 2010 and accounting for an estimated $1.5 billion in revenue for the Big Four firms last year, according to data from the International Accounting Bulletin. KPMG has 10,000 people in China, he said. The issues the auditing industry has faced with Chinese clients lately is not crimping the firm\\'s growth plans there, he said. One issue being mentioned as a way to help corporate governance is audit rotation, where companies are forced to switch auditors after a certain period of time. Andrew was critical of this idea, saying that this raises cost concerns and that mistakes can go undetected during an audit handover. \"The empirical evidence shows that errors occur on that change,\" he said. Among the items he listed to improve the industry was allowing firms to expand the scope of their audits and mandatory cooperation between auditors and regulators.

      "{'text': ' Chevron ( CVX.N ) said on Friday it planned to invest $3 billion in Brazil over the next three years, despite uproar in the South American country after an oil spill this month caused by its offshore drilling. \\n Chevron was ordered to halt its drilling in Brazil this week pending investigations by the Federal Police and other authorities, after an estimated 2,400 barrels of oil leaked from its Frade field off Rio de Janeiro\\'s coast. Chevron\\'s Head of Latin America and Africa operations, Ali Moshiri, said planned investments were on top of $2.1 billion the oil giant has already invested in Brazil since 1997. He said Chevron was looking out for profitable oil concessions. \"We plan to continue participating in new auctions for oil exploration blocks in Brazil, if there is creation of value and benefits,\" Moshiri said in a press conference in Rio de Janeiro. Talk of expansion comes after the second-largest U.S. oil firm was fined $28 million by Brazil\\'s environmental agency for the spill, an amount likely to rise when the energy regulator and Rio\\'s state government fines as they have promised to do. Auctions for oil concessions in Brazil are now suspended as the country draws up new policies for the sector that is on the verge of rapid expansion after the discovery of massive \\'subsalt\\' offshore reserves deep under a layer of salt rock. Moshiri said the planned investment was mainly for the $5.2 billion Papa-Terra project. It has a minority stake with the project\\'s operator, Brazil\\'s state-run Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ). Both Papa-Terra and Frade are located in the offshore Campos basin where most of Brazil\\'s 2 million-barrel-per-day output comes from. Analysts say the spill is likely to increasingly politicize the governance of the country\\'s oil sector. It has already given ammunition to Rio de Janeiro state\\'s lawmakers fighting proposals to share more oil wealth with non-producing states. DEFIANT ON WELL PLANS Moshiri, described as premature the government\\'s ban on its drilling, which it had already halted voluntarily shortly after the oil leak was discovered. It said the crude leaked from fissures in the seabed after rock \"parted\" during drilling. He said the company had not given up on plans to drill another separate well at Frade that would perforate through to deeper subsalt oil reserves, despite the energy regulator turning down its request for that project this week. The regulator, the ANP, said the well would be at even greater risk of spill than the one that leaked because of the greater depths involved. Moshiri said the spill had cost Chevron about $30 million in clean-up costs. It had invested about $20 million in the well it was drilling which it is now working to permanently seal off. The head of Chevron\\'s Brazil operations, George Buck, apologized for the November 8 spill at the country\\'s Congress on Wednesday where he insisted the company used all its resources to stop the flow of oil which has now virtually ceased. Chevron has acknowledged that it was mistaken in its estimates of pressure and rock strength in the reservoir it was targeting. It is the majority stakeholder in the Frade concession with Brazil\\'s state-run Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ) and a Japanese consortium. The only rig working for Chevron off Brazil is Transocean Ltd\\'s ( RIGN.VX ) Sedco 706, which drilled the well that leaked. Brazil\\'s national energy regulator, ANP, said on Friday the oil stain on the ocean surface many miles out to sea was shrinking but still visible.

The new figures are part of the country\\'s updated mid-term fiscal plan for 2012-2015, which was revised to take into account its deeper-than-expected recession and a debt cut plan agreed by its international lenders last month. Greece is struggling to meet budget targets as it goes through its fourth year of recession, and needs the next tranche of funds under an ongoing EU/IMF bailout to avoid bankruptcy next month. Euro zone countries should have budget deficits below 3 percent of GDP, a target Greece still aims to achieve in three years, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters. \"We stick to the target to reduce the deficit to below 3 percent by 2015,\" the official said. \"The revised mid-term plan does not take into account the additional fiscal measures that will be finalized and announced in June,\" he added.

Instead, he plans to extend the number of S-Class derivatives from a current three to six in order to boost the model\\'s volume, possibly even doubling it to 80,000 cars a year. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on which new S-Class derivatives would be added on top of the existing saloon, long-wheelbase saloon and the coupe, sold under the CL-Class nameplate. \"Maybach sold cars upwards of 300,000 euros, but what we want to do now is move into the 100,000-300,000 euros segment -- where the annual volumes are in the thousands and not the hundreds,\" the spokesman said. BRITISH MARQUES TOO STRONG Originally aiming for volumes of 1,000 cars a year when launched in late 2002, Daimler has seen Maybach\\'s annual sales slump to around 200 cars, where they held steady last year. Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ), by comparison, took far more successful excursions into the superluxury segment thanks to scooping up British marques Bentley and Rolls-Royce, respectively. Auto industry experts have long argued Maybach, a brand that before its revival in 2002 had not been in production since 1940, enjoyed no strong standing among the discriminating wealthy. BMW\\'s Rolls-Royce, by contrast, has seen volumes soar 41 percent to 2,441 cars in the first nine months of this year, driven particularly by its lower price, higher volume Ghost model. VW\\'s Bentley, best known for grand tourers like the Continental GT rather than large saloons, managed to increase its sales by 31 percent to 4,763 cars. The Maybach became such an image liability that Daimler stopped publishing monthly volume statistics several years ago, preferring only to present the figure in its annual accounts.

      "{'text': ' A federal judge has said credit ratings are not always protected opinion under the First Amendment, a defeat for credit rating agencies in a lawsuit brought by investors who lost money on mortgage-backed securities. \\n The November 12 decision was a little-noticed setback for McGraw-Hill Cos\\' Standard & Poor\\'s, Moody\\'s Corp\\'s Moody\\'s Investors Service and Fimalac SA\\'s Fitch Ratings, which have long invoked First Amendment free speech protection to defend against lawsuits over their ratings. These agencies had argued that the Constitution protected them from claims they issued inflated ratings on more than $5 billion of securities issued in 2006 and 2007, and backed by loans from former Thornburg Mortgage Inc and other lenders. But the judge said the ratings were shared with too small a group of investors to deserve the broad protection sought. \"The court rejects the rating agency defendants\\' arguments that the First Amendment provides any protection to them under the facts of this case,\" U.S. District Judge James Browning in Albuquerque, New Mexico, wrote in a 273-page opinion. Browning nonetheless dismissed claims accusing Moody\\'s and Fitch, but not S&P, of misrepresentations, saying the investors did not adequately allege that the two agencies did not believe their ratings, or knowingly concealed their inaccuracy. He also said federal law preempts some arguments that the investors used to recover under New Mexico securities law. The judge said the investors may file an amended complaint, which had sought class-action status. If the state law claims went forward, it could provide an avenue for investors to go after the agencies in other states. Browning had denied the agencies\\' motion to dismiss the complaint on September 30, without giving reasons. S&P, in a statement, called the First Amendment ruling \"inconsistent\" with other court rulings. Fitch spokesman Daniel Noonan said that agency is pleased that claims against it were dismissed. Moody\\'s and lawyers for the investors declined to comment or had no immediate comment. Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are among the other defendants in the case. Rating agencies have been widely faulted by investors, regulators and Congress for contributing to the global credit and financial crises that began in 2007 by issuing high ratings on debt that did not deserve it. Thornburg made \"jumbo\" home loans, larger than $417,000, to borrowers considered good credit risks, but collapsed after margin calls and a plunge in the value of mortgages it held. The Santa Fe, New Mexico-based lender filed for bankruptcy on May 1, 2009, and is now called TMST Inc. LIMITED DISTRIBUTION Investors led by two pension funds, the Maryland-National Capital Park & Planning Commission Employees\\' Retirement System, and the Midwest Operating Engineers Pension Trust Fund in Illinois, claimed the agencies issued false and misleading investment-grade ratings for Thornburg securities, and were paid \"substantial\" sums that compromised their independence. But Browning said the ratings were distributed only to a \"limited group\" of investors, not the public at large. He also said that unlike publicly traded companies, the trusts from which the securities were issued were not \"public figures\" entitled to more protections. \"The court rejects the rating agency defendants\\' argument that the First Amendment protections regarding provably false opinions apply to their credit ratings,\" Browning wrote. Rating agencies have largely been successful in raising the First Amendment defense. For example, in September, a federal judge threw out a lawsuit by then-Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray on behalf of pension funds, and said ratings were \"predictive opinions.\" In contrast, a Manhattan federal judge, in a 2009 ruling involving Morgan Stanley, said the defense does not apply when ratings were provided to a \"select group of investors\" in a private placement. S&P has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission not to file threatened civil charges over its ratings for a 2007 offering, Delphinus CDO 2007-1. The case is Genesee County Employees\\' Retirement System et al v. Thornburg Mortgage Securities Trust 2006-3 et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Mexico, No. 09-00300.

      "{'text': ' The British ex-CEO of Japan\\'s Olympus Corp emerged from a frosty meeting of directors on Friday convinced its board would eventually quit over an accounting scandal engulfing the firm, but he said he wasn\\'t \"begging\" to return and clean up the mess. \\n Michael Woodford, still an Olympus director despite being fired as CEO and blowing the whistle over the scam, described the meeting as a tense encounter with no handshakes or apologies offered from the men who had sacked him barely a month ago. Instead, he said, the board had agreed that the once-proud maker of cameras and medical equipment should strive to avoid being delisted from the Tokyo stock exchange, a sanction that would make the business more vulnerable to takeover. \"I just see a lot of suffering and misery for no gain,\" Woodford said of the prospect of a delisting. \"But we should have the investigation, it shouldn\\'t be fudged,\" he told a news conference after the almost-two-hour meeting at Olympus\\'s Tokyo headquarters, where he was mobbed by reporters and TV crews as he entered and left the building. Woodford, back in Japan for the first time since fleeing the country right after his October 14 sacking, said there had been no talk at the meeting of him returning to his former post. \"I\\'m not begging to come back,\" he said, though he added that he was willing to do so if shareholders desired it. \"I didn\\'t volunteer for this, I\\'m not a hero,\" he added. \"There was a tension in the room, but there seemed to be an understanding that it was in no one\\'s interest to raise the temperature,\" he said. \"They didn\\'t shake my hand and I didn\\'t offer mine. We said good morning and goodbye.\" Major foreign shareholders have called for Woodford to be immediately reinstated, saying he can restore faith in the 92-year-old firm. The visit by Woodford, who also met this week with police and other investigators probing the scandal, coincided with a rally in Olympus shares, which have been buoyed by speculation the firm can escape delisting. The stock rose as much as 25 percent on Friday before closing up 8.6 percent at 1,107 yen. It has rebounded a whopping 77 percent in just four trading days, though it is still down more than half since the day before Woodford\\'s dismissal. Woodford said Olympus could survive as an independent entity as long as banks, so far supportive, kept backing it. DUBIOUS DEALS, CRIME SUSPICION Olympus had fired Woodford, a rare foreign CEO in Japan, alleging he had failed to adapt to Japanese culture and the company\\'s management style. Woodford says he was axed for questioning dubious merger and acquisition payments. Suspicion has swirled about possible links between the payments and organised crime. Woodford said he had no firm proof of gangster links but urged authorities to \"follow the money.\" \"That would be concerning if organised crime was involved ... but there\\'s no evidence of that to date,\" he said. The 51-year-old freckle-faced Briton had left Japan after his dismissal citing concerns for his safety. Olympus first denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted it had hidden investment losses from investors for two decades and used some of $1.3 billion in M&A payments to aid the cover-up. Woodford said after Friday\\'s board meeting that the top priority was for Olympus to meet a December 14 deadline for filing its financial statements for the six-months to September -- after which, he added, current management should go. The company would be automatically delisted if it misses the deadline. Even if it meets the deadline, the Tokyo Stock Exchange can still delist it, depending on the scale of past misstatements or if a link is found to \"yakuza\" gangsters. A third-party panel appointed by Olympus to look into the accounting scam said this week that it had not yet found any evidence of involvement by organised crime. AUDITORS, GOVERNANCE The Olympus affair has raised questions about whether its auditors, the Japanese arms of global giants KPMG and Ernst & Young, should have done more to follow up on red flags. KPMG\\'S chairman, Michael Andrew, on Friday called for a global set of standards for the auditing industry but said that KPMG had done the right thing in the actions it took pertaining to the Japanese company. \"What is pretty evident to me is that it is a very, very significant fraud,\" Andrew said in a speech in Hong Kong. \"We should wait for the Japanese authorities to disclose that.\" \"I think it is very hard to jump to the conclusion that it\\'s a corporate governance failure,\" he said. The scandal has also revived criticism of corporate governance in a country that Woodford said needed people who would \"challenge and scrutinize.\" He also took a swipe at mainstream Japanese media for being slow to cover the scandal. \"What Japan should do is look around the world for the best human resources ... It would be sad if no more gaijin come,\" he said, using the Japanese word for foreigners. On the eve of the board meeting, two Olympus directors and an internal auditor blamed for the scandal quit and the president announced that current management was ready to step down once the firm\\'s recovery was on track. Current president Shuichi Takayama should stay until December 14, but changes could start thereafter, Woodford said, adding that his fellow directors seemed to realize they would have to go but had given no explicit commitment to resign. Woodford also said Japanese authorities probing the scandal, whom he met in Tokyo on Thursday, wanted to talk to him again. Tokyo police, prosecutors and regulators have launched a rare joint probe of the scandal. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Britain\\'s Serious Fraud Office are also looking into the affair. Shareholders have asked Olympus to seek more damages from former and current executives if they are found to have caused losses to company value through acquisitions at the center of a scandal, the company said in a statement on Friday.

      "{'text': ' Credit rating agency Moody\\'s cut Hungary\\'s debt to \"junk\" grade late on Thursday, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Viktor Orban\\'s unorthodox economic policies and prompting his government to denounce the move as a \"financial attack.\" \\n Moody\\'s lowered Hungary\\'s sovereign rating by one notch to Ba1, just below investment grade, with a negative outlook, hours after rival Standard & Poor\\'s held fire on a flagged downgrade after Budapest said it would seek international aid. The move followed warnings from all three major ratings agencies that Orban\\'s policies, which have eschewed traditional austerity in favor of revenue-boosting steps like a special bank tax and the nationalization of $14 billion in pension assets, had put Hungary\\'s finances at risk. It also came after Orban relaunched aid talks this week with the International Monetary Fund, a dramatic reversal after he cut cooperation with the Fund short last year after sweeping a 2010 election on a vow to regain \"economic sovereignty.\" Moody\\'s cited rising uncertainty about Hungary\\'s ability to meet fiscal goals, high debt levels and what it called increasingly constrained medium-term growth prospects. \"Moody\\'s believes that the combined impact of these factors will adversely impact the government\\'s financial strength and erode its shock-absorption capacity,\" it said in a statement. Hungarian bond yields soared by about a full percentage point, lifting its entire bond curve above 9 percent, but yields dropped by about 20-30 basis points in afternoon trade as high yields prompted buyers to enter the market. The cost of insuring Hungarian debt against default jumped to new record highs at 635 basis points, eclipsing earlier highs hit in March 2009. The forint rebounded from morning falls of about 1.6 percent to trade at 314.10 by 1259 GMT. The Czech crown fell to a 17-month low and the Polish zloty dipped beyond the 4.50 per euro level and briefly approached a 27-month low of 4.537 hit in September. Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said that although most of central and Eastern Europe was better off than southern Europe, fears over the euro zone debt crisis and the Hungarian downgrade indicated turmoil ahead. \"There\\'s no question that sentiment toward the region is deteriorating rapidly and that even the most resilient economies are in for a rough ride in the months ahead,\" he said. SHORT-LIVED SURPLUS The downgrade is a major setback for Orban, whose Fidesz party ousted Socialists he has blamed for economic mismanagement by winning a two-thirds majority in last year\\'s election. He has cut taxes for families and small firms and raised tariffs on banks, utilities and other big, mainly foreign-owned, firms, putting the country of 10 million on track to run one of the European Union\\'s only budget surpluses this year. But his policies have failed to spur growth and irked voters who resent his aggressive tactics and oppose his seizing private pension savings to fund an inefficient public sector. The government\\'s unpredictability and rising pressure from the euro zone crisis have hammered investor sentiment. The forint has fallen 16.3 percent since July 1, versus 12.6 percent for its regional peer the Polish zloty and 6.7 percent for the Czech crown. The Economy Ministry has blamed the currency\\'s plummet -- which has hit Hungarians who have borrowed in foreign currency -- on market speculators. It said the downgrade was unwarranted, the latest in a string of \"financial attacks against Hungary.\" \"Obviously, the forint\\'s weakening is not justified by either the performance of the Hungarian economy, or the shape of the budget,\" the Economy Ministry said in a statement. The government cited its commitment to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent of economic output next year, 1 percent of GDP\\'s worth of reserves in the 2012 budget, and an expected decline in debt levels, as arguments against the rating cut. But Moody\\'s said the government\\'s 2.5 percent of GDP budget deficit target for next year may be difficult to meet due to high funding costs and low economic growth. The weak forint pushed Hungary\\'s government debt to 82 percent of economic output by the end of the third quarter, undoing the impact of Orban\\'s $14 billion pension asset grab. Hungary must roll over 4.7 billion euros in external debt next year as it starts repaying part of its 20 billion euros, 2008 bailout from the IMF -- something that could be solved with a new financing deal. In his unexpected about face on potential IMF support, Orban made clear that he would not accept any demands in exchange for cash at the ready should the need arise. but Moody\\'s said the request to resume talks illustrated Budapest\\'s funding challenges. \"Even with such an arrangement, the government\\'s debt structure will remain vulnerable to shocks in the medium term, which are inconsistent with a Baa3 rating,\" Moody\\'s said. \"SAFETY NET\" The European Commission forecasts the economy will expand by only 0.5 percent at most next year, far lower than the 3 percent initially forecast in Orban\\'s medium-term budget plan. Complicating that further is high unemployment, weak bank lending and 5 trillion forints in mostly Swiss franc denominated foreign currency mortgages which have seen repayments soar due to the franc\\'s strength and forint\\'s slide. Orban has introduced an option for families to repay loans at exchange rates below market levels, but that has roiled markets and inflicted billions of forints of losses on the bank sector, undermining growth and lending. Economists said the gloomy economic outlook could combine with the downgrade and increase pressure on Budapest to accept an IMF deal with the monitoring and policy recommendations Orban has spurned. \"As the economy will tumble into recession by around the turn of the year, we expect that it will have no other choice than to accept any IMF proposal, even if this would include conditionalities,\" said Michal Dybula at BNP Paribas. Moody\\'s said it would further lower Hungary\\'s rating if there was a significant decline in government financial strength due to a lack of progress on structural reforms and implementation of a medium-term plan. The ratings cut came just hours after S&P deferred its decision on a possible downgrade of Hungary to non-investment grade until end-February, pending IMF talks. Fitch, another rating agency which has Hungary in the lowest investment-grade category, has said an agreement on a new IMF program could reduce downward pressure on Hungary\\'s rating.

      "{'text': ' Japan\\'s core consumer prices fell for the first time in four months in the year to October after a cigarette tax hike a year ago dropped out from calculations revealing persistent deflation caused by chronically weak domestic demand. \\n In fact, November data for the Tokyo area showed deeper declines that exceeded analysts\\' forecasts and backed the view that the Bank of Japan will maintain ultra-easy monetary policy for the foreseeable future. A narrower measure of prices that excludes both food and energy fell from a year ago in a sign that the world\\'s third-largest economy continued to struggle with lackluster job market, weak consumer demand and excess capacity. Core consumer prices fell 0.1 percent as forecast in a sign of weak aggregate demand as a strong yen and spillover from Europe\\'s sovereign debt crisis dampen export demand. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa on Friday expressed the central bank\\'s growing alarm that the euro zone crisis may bring more pain for the Japanese economy. \"Europe\\'s sovereign problems have affected Japan through the yen\\'s strength and stock price falls. As emerging economies that have close trading relations with Europe slow down, Japan\\'s exports to those economies may decline,\" Shirakawa said. \"The impact on the Japanese economy may grow bigger.\" Japan\\'s economy rebounded from a recession triggered by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and grew 1.5 percent in the third quarter. But it is expected to slow sharply this quarter as the initial spurt driven by companies restoring supply chains and production facilities tails off. With an expected boost from a $155 billion reconstruction budget passed this week still some months away, policymakers in Tokyo may feel pressure to help the economy again with yen-selling intervention and monetary policy easing. \"The price data underscores the sluggishness of domestic demand as the economy\\'s recovery has taken a breather because of a delay in reconstruction efforts and a global economic slowdown,\" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo. Finance Minister Jun Azumi pledged to shield exporters from sharp currency moves while expressing frustration with Europe\\'s inability to contain the debt rout that has been driving nervous investors away from the euro and into more stable markets such as Japanese government debt. \"It\\'s really a shame because Europe\\'s problems have started to intensify just when we were starting to see some bright signs on Japan\\'s horizon,\" Azumi said. FRESH WARNING The yen hovered around 77.35 yen against the dollar on Friday, having firmed gradually since Japan sold nearly $100 billion worth of yen last month, knocking it down from record a record high of 75.31 per dollar. More gains threatening Japan\\'s recovery could spur further action from the finance ministry and the BOJ. For now, however, Shirakawa stuck with the bank\\'s view that rebuilding efforts from the devastating March 11 and continued growth in Japan\\'s main export markets in Asia should help sustain moderate economic recovery. \"The outlook on the BOJ\\'s easing measures will depend largely on forex moves. Europe\\'s debt problems are expected to be prolonged and the effects from Japan\\'s intervention and the BOJ\\'s easing steps may fade early next year,\" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance. \"So there is a chance of additional BOJ easing in January or February.\" While the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile prices of fresh food, inched down for the first time in four months, the so-called core-core index, which also excludes energy prices and is similar to the core U.S. index, fell 1.0 percent in the year to October. Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, fell 0.5 percent in the year to November, compared with the median estimate for a 0.3 percent annual decline. JPCPIT=ECI Some economists say consumer prices could fall further in coming months as a slowing global economy dents oil prices, while deflationary pressures persist.

      "{'text': ' Retailers were hoping for more shoppers like Shawn Elzia as the annual Black Friday bargain stampede marked the unofficial start of what is widely expected to be a middling holiday shopping season. \\n The Brooklyn, New York teacher, one of hundreds of thousands of shoppers jostling for deals around the country, said he ended up spending about 25 percent more than he planned, even while worrying about the state of the economy. \"I did not expect such deals,\" the 33-year old said as he left a Macy\\'s store in Jersey City, New Jersey clutching bags full of clothing for himself and his family. \"It\\'s slashed down to the bones,\" he said. \"There were some great discounts if you showed up early.\" Deals are always part of the picture on the Friday after Thanksgiving. This year was notable for an earlier opening for some retailers and possibly for the one shopper using pepper spray to make sure she could get a popular video game system. The early start by stores brought out younger shoppers such as Alina Ybarra, who spent the wee hours of the morning with her friends as they all looked for items for themselves. \"It\\'s really chaotic,\" Ybarra, 17, said of her first Black Friday outing as she finished her shopping in Santa Monica, California. She said that she liked the deals at stores such as Gap Inc\\'s Old Navy and Urban Outfitters. \"It seems like a lot of teenagers were the primary shoppers, maybe because of the hour, but I think net-net it\\'s not really going to result in an incremental positive for retailers,\" Ed Yruma, senior equity analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said after checking out crowds at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. He said shoppers were not carrying a lot of shopping bags. Leon Clare, 24, and Shawn Sykes, 27, both U.S. Navy Corpsmen, drove about 125 miles from 29 Palms Marine Base to Santa Monica so they each could spend close to $175 on a pair of Air Jordan Retro 3 shoes in \"Black Cement,\" popular new sneakers from Nike Inc. \"This is for me,\" said Clare, who plans to spend more on holiday gifts later on in the season. \"I\\'m leaving for Afghanistan in March. I\\'m getting something for everyone, just in case I don\\'t come back.\" WORRIED... AGAIN More than 120 stores at the Mall of America opened at midnight. The crowd at that point was about 15,000 people. Mall operators estimated that it was the largest crowd ever at the mall, which is big enough to hold seven Yankee Stadiums. While eager shoppers emerged from stores around the country lugging big-screen TVs and bags full of video games and toys, it was far from certain that people will pull out their wallets for much more than the best deals this year. Shoppers with limited budgets started using layaway at chains such as Walmart as early as October. Retail shares fell more than the overall market on Friday. \"Americans are still worried about jobs, still worried about the economy,\" said Mike Thielmann, group executive vice president at J.C. Penney, who noted that shoppers were buying gifts and for themselves, and said jewelry was selling well. In Houston, Rico Salvosa, 60, bought two cameras at Best Buy and said he had saved about $170. \"It\\'s worse than before because business is slow,\" Salvosa, who wholesales stone countertops, said as he left the store with his daughters. \"I don\\'t have a lot of savings for holiday shopping. I told them, \\'I cannot buy everything that you\\'d like.\\'\" Competition among the retailers was fierce as it was among shoppers, as some stores opened hours earlier than before. Outside Macy\\'s flagship store in New York, some Occupy Wall Street activists chanted \"boycott Macy\\'s\" and \"stop supporting big corporations\" even as about 9,000 people lined up to shop when the store opened at midnight. Opening early appeared to work, judging from the long lines at stores such as Macy\\'s, Toys R Us, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. \"It was crazy around midnight and one in the morning,\" said a Target employee at the chain\\'s East Harlem, New York store, where the crowd thinned out later on Friday morning. Even after a Toys R Us in New Jersey had been open for nearly an hour, at 9:50 p.m. EST on Thursday night, there was still a line of about 300 people waiting to get inside. The 24 hours that started at 9 p.m. Thursday will be the biggest in retail history, with sales estimated at $27 billion, according to Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, one of the few experts predicting a strong season. The term \"Black Friday\" commonly refers to the day after Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the busy holiday shopping season when retailers do brisk business. (See related story: Spirited \\'Black Friday\\' has dark roots. While it is the busiest day of the year in terms of store traffic, it does not always mean that sales will soar for the season. Despite brisk sales right after Thanksgiving in 2008 and 2009, total holiday season sales fell as the recession gripped the country. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, expects 152 million people to hit stores this weekend, up 10.1 percent from last year. Yet it expects sales for the full November-December holiday season to rise just 2.8 percent, well below the pace of last year when sales rose 5.2 percent. Luxury chains such as Saks Inc and those catering to lower-income shoppers, such as dollar stores, are expected to do well this shopping season. \"For our products that are $25,000 and up, growth is phenomenal,\" said Mark Vadon, founder of online jewelry retailer Blue Nile. \"Price points under $100 are also doing really well. For the mass part of the market, consumers are strapped and being a lot more wary.\" Overall, retail executives and analysts expect a more competitive shopping season than in 2010. Unemployment remains at 9 percent, European debt woes are weighing on the stock market, and consumer confidence remains spotty. Online sales on Thursday and Friday surpassed last year, and more shoppers used their mobile devices to buy, according to IBM data. The amount U.S. shoppers spent via eBay Mobile more than doubled on Thanksgiving, while eBay\\'s PayPal Mobile unit saw a five-fold increase in global mobile payment volume versus last Thanksgiving. The online push put pressure on some companies. Walmart.com saw some very high traffic, so some customers may have experienced delays as they tried to check out, it said. Even Apple Inc gets into the Christmas spirit on Black Friday, the only day that it usually offers discounts. This year it offered its typical $101 discount on its $900-plus Mac laptops and $41 or more off its $499-plus iPads. (Reporting by  Dhanya Skariachan ,  Liana B.

      "{'text': ' Italy\\'s borrowing costs soared to their highest levels since Rome joined the euro on Friday, piling pressure on the newly installed government of Mario Monti at the end of a week in which the euro zone crisis tainted even safe haven Germany. \\n A punishing bond sale, in which Italy was forced to pay a record 6.5 percent for six months paper, came after a disastrous German bond auction earlier in the week and the leaders of France, Germany and Italy failed to make headway in tackling the growing debt crisis. Amid signs that the euro zone contagion is spreading, indications emerged in Madrid that the People\\'s Party, getting ready to form a government in the coming weeks, may apply for international aid to shore up its finances. After winning an election this month, the PP under Mariano Rajoy inherits an economy on the verge of recession, a tough 2012 public deficit target, financing costs driven to near unsustainable levels by nervous debt markets and a battered bank sector with billions of euros of troubled assets on its books. Tuesday\\'s launch by the International Monetary Fund of a credit facility for fiscally responsible countries at risk from the euro zone debt crisis gives it a potential lifeline it may wish to exploit. \"I don\\'t believe the decision has been made ... but it is one of the options on the table, because I\\'ve been asked about it. But we need more time and more information on the current state of things,\" a source close to the PP told Reuters. Italy\\'s auction on Friday, described by one analyst as \"awful,\" spooked investors further and pushed two-year yields on the secondary market to an eye-watering euro lifetime high of more than 8 percent. Longer term debt is above a \"red line\" of 7 percent which forced Portugal, Greece and Ireland into bailouts that Europe could not afford for the much bigger Italian economy. Spiralling borrowing costs have added to pressure on Monti\\'s government of technocrats, hastily sworn in this month after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was bundled out of office as economic pressures grew. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn threw his  backing behind Monti but warned that swift action was needed to contain the escalating euro zone debt crisis. He dismissed fears that the euro\\'s survival was in question but said the crisis had reached the heart of the single currency. \"This contagion effect has been touching the proximity of the core and even touching the core itself,\" he told a news conference after meeting Monti in Rome. \"It shows that this is an increasingly systemic phenomenon, which calls for strong financial firewalls in order to contain this contagion and have a counterforce to this market turbulence.\" EYES ON ECB With the European Central Bank coming under increasing pressure to take more effective action, something it and Germany continue to oppose in public, officials suggested one possible scenario that could break the impasse. A push by euro zone countries toward very close fiscal integration could give the ECB the necessary room for maneuver to dramatically scale up euro zone bond purchases and stabilize markets. The ECB, which cannot directly finance governments, has been buying Italian and Spanish bonds intermittently on the secondary market since August to try to keep their borrowing costs and contain Europe\\'s sovereign debt problem. But Italian and Spanish yields have nonetheless reached levels that economists see as unsustainable, raising the possibility that Rome and Madrid will be forced to seek emergency international funding. \"We are not far from a point when the disruption in the markets is so big that monetary policy transmission does not work at all,\" said one euro zone official involved in shaping the euro zone\\'s policy response to the crisis. \"If the ECB has the assurance that we are moving toward a fiscal union, they could be ready to go all out,\" he said Belgium, which had prided itself on being able to stabilize its debt position despite having had no government for the past 18 months, saw its credit rating downgraded. Political deadlock in Brussels prompted Standard & Poor\\'s to cut Belgium\\'s credit rating to double-A from double-A-plus, citing concerns about funding and market pressures, as the euro zone debt crisis continues to worsen. \"We need a reply that is clear and credible if we are to avoid the worst,\" Belgium\\'s caretaker prime minister, Yves Leterme, told Belgian television. The downgrade followed difficulties this week in Belgium\\'s drawn-out attempt to form a government. Elio Di Rupo, leader of the French-speaking Socialists, had been trying to form a government based on a six-party coalition. But he tendered his resignation on Monday after talks for a 2012 budget - agreement on which is a condition for forming a government - ground to a halt. Greek, the source of the euro zone\\'s debt crisis, provided another source of dispute. Investors\\' worries intensified after reports that Greece was demanding harsh conditions from creditors on a proposed bond swap -- critical to reduce its debt and avoid default. Banks represented by the Institute of International Finance agreed last month to write off the notional value of their Greek bondholdings by 50 percent to reduce Greece\\'s debt ratio to 120 percent of its gross domestic product by 2020. But Greece was demanding that its new bonds\\' net present value -- a measure of the current worth of future cash flows -- be cut to 25 percent, a far harsher measure than the banks had in mind, according to people briefed on the matter.

      "{'text': ' Bank of New York Mellon Corp, which was derided for a plan to charge some of its large corporate and investment management clients for holding their deposits, appears to have flinched. \\n The bank has not assessed a penny since warning clients about the possible deposit fee in early August, officials told Reuters, although it remains burdened by cash that it cannot profitably redeploy at rock-bottom interest rates. The fee of 0.13 percent was to have taken effect on August 8 for accounts with more than $50 million that had soared well above their monthly averages as clients fled short-term investments for the safety of U.S. banks. \"My guess is that the backlash was pretty stringent and they decided not to do it,\" said William Gerber, chief financial officer of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, a cash-management client of Bank of New York. \"I can see their problem but I\\'m not that empathetic considering all the fees we\\'ve been waiving.\" He was referring to hundreds of millions of dollars of money-market mutual fund fees that financial companies have waived over the past two years lest investors realize negative returns on their fund holdings. Unlike Bank of America, which was shamed into withdrawing a plan to charge its customers $5 for debit card transactions after a torrent of articles ridiculing the proposal, Bank of New York said that its super-sized version of its deposit fee is not dead. \"We haven\\'t charged any clients to date, and the policy remains in place as markets remain unsettled and interest rates remain at historic lows,\" BNY Mellon spokesman Ron Sommer wrote in an email. The fee, he added, was aimed at \"a small number of clients with extraordinarily high and volatile deposit levels.\" In its August letter, the bank urged clients to consider cash investment options \"to minimize any effect\" of the mooted fee. ANXIETY DROVE DEPOSITS The plan was prompted by a flood of deposits from companies, money-market funds and other clients fleeing short-term investments that exposed them in late July to the then-unfolding Greek financial crisis and from U.S. government securities amid a Congressional impasse over raising the U.S. debt ceiling. A source said Bank of New York\\'s deposits swelled about 39 percent in a period of two weeks in late July and early August to about $250 billion, underscoring the fragility of the global financial system at any sign of panic and creating balance-sheet management challenges for the bank. At the end of September, deposits were 45 percent higher than a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Todd Gibbons said in discussing third-quarter earnings, though he said the influx had stabilized since earlier in the quarter. Sommer declined to discuss the deposit levels. Bank of New York continues to attract a heavy flow of cash since it has higher ratings from Moody\\'s Investor Services than trust bank competitors such as State Street Corp and Northern Trust Corp, another official said. Those banks did not match Bank of New York\\'s deposit fee announcement, although some commercial banks with larger lending businesses that fund loans with deposits have been passing FDIC fees to some of their small-business customers. The policy was initiated under former Bank of New York Chief Executive Robert Kelly, who was ousted in early September and replaced by Gerald Hassell, a 30-plus-year veteran of Bank of New York who some insiders said was more sensitive to client relationships. Kelly took the top role when the New York bank combined in 2007 with Pittsburgh-based Mellon Financial Corp, which he led. \"I believe they are backing away from the strategy, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in an email. \"Not certain if it is customer backlash or a rethinking of strategy under new CEO.\" Custody banks make most of their money from holding securities and other assets for clients worldwide and ensuring that they are properly accounted for and exchanged when clients demand. Bank of New York swapped its 338 retail branches and small business banking businesses in 2006 for JPMorgan Chase & Co\\'s corporate trust business and $150 million in cash. The deal helped Bank of New York avoid some of the credit problems that continue to depress earnings of more traditional banks, but deprives it of the ability to negotiate on loans and other businesses in return for winning custody activities. Because rates are so low, many custody banks today are less eager to attract new business or are more aggressive about insisting that clients offset the low-return deposit business by using other services, said Anthony Carfang, head of Treasury Strategies, a Chicago-based consulting firm.

      "{'text': ' Global supermarket chains welcomed a long-awaited invitation from India to invest in the country\\'s $450 billion retail market, but they fear the small print may keep a lid on investment in the short term. \\n The government on Thursday approved 51 percent foreign direct investment in supermarkets, paving the way for firms such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Tesco and Carrefour to enter one of the world\\'s largest untapped markets. Shares in Indian retailers jumped -- bucking the weaker stock market trend -- in anticipation of interest from those big foreign retailers. The move may breathe new life into the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who ushered in free market reforms 20 years ago but has been bogged down by corruption scandals and was starting to be seen as a lame duck. As well as appealing to India\\'s burgeoning urban middle class the reform will draw in much-needed new investment to a sputtering economy. Policymakers say spending on cold-storage and warehousing will ease supply-side pressures that have driven inflation close to a double-digit clip. \"It\\'s important not only for raising overall growth, but also for containing inflation and improving the quality of life for over 50 percent of the population,\" said central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao. Investment could exceed $5 billion in the next 5-7 years as hundreds of hypermarkets are opened, said Vijay Karwal, head of retail at the Royal Bank of Scotland. \"There may be a degree of \\'catch up\\' with foreign flows into India retail possibly starting to match, if not exceed, those into China as development picks up pace,\" he said. The move carries risk for Prime Minister Singh, whose party must contest five state elections next year. It is opposed by millions of small shop owners who fear for their livelihoods, and prompted an uproar in India\\'s parliament, which was forced to close until Monday. Some politicians threatened extreme action to prevent supermarkets opening. \"If Wal-Mart tries to open its mall anywhere, I will burn it myself,\" said Uma Bharti, a former state chief minister from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), local media reported. An India-wide group representing small traders said it was planning protests for next week. \"They should have worked on some kind of protectionist mechanism for smaller traders,\" said Praveen Khandelwa, the head of the confederation of all India traders. RIDERS To appease its opponents, the government insisted foreign retailers source almost a third of their produce from small industries, invest a minimum of $100 million in India and spend half of that on \"back end\" infrastructure. An official at one major international retailer said the company was concerned about the numbers the government had mentioned. \"Some of the conditions look quite stringent. The investment in particular -- it\\'s all quite big money. We\\'d need to know the details, and how that would be accounted for,\" the official said on condition of anonymity. Foreign stores will only be permitted in cities of more than 1 million people, and individual states will decide whether to allow the global giants on to their patch. [ID:nD8E7LL01S] That could, for example, exclude investor-favorite states like Gujarat, which is run by the Hindu nationalist BJP that opposes new foreign supermarkets. Sharma said new investment would create 10 million jobs in the next three years and would not affect small shops, a claim scorned by parties on both the left and right who predict that millions of jobs will be lost. \"We are sitting on a time bomb in terms of employment,\" said economist Jayati Ghosh. She said India should upgrade public and cooperative supply infrastructure, not rely on corporations. The head of Wal-Mart\\'s local cash-and-carry joint venture praised the move, but also struck a note of caution. \"We will need to study the conditions and the finer details of the new policy and the impact that it will have on our ability to do business in India,\" said Raj Jain, CEO of Bharti Wal-Mart. TOUGH GOING Domestic retail chains have operated in India for years but have struggled to expand due to funding difficulties, a lack of expertise and poor roads and cold storage facilities. If political opposition mounts, foreign firms could find the going tough. India\\'s biggest listed company, Reliance Industries, was forced to backtrack on plans in 2007 to open Western-style supermarkets in the state of Uttar Pradesh after huge protests from small traders and political parties. Bijou Kurien, a senior executive at Reliance Retail, said the mood had changed. \"The regulatory and non-regulatory pressures in India are the way of life,\" he said. \"So any person running a business in India has to be able to figure out how to steer their way through all the obstacles that can be in their path.\" He said the back-end and sourcing rules may stop big-box electronics stores from coming into India for now, but said the rules would likely soften in the medium term. The conditions could also deter smaller international retail chains, said Himanshu Pal, global data manager at consultants Kantar Retail. However he said India should appeal to budget chains. \"The Indian shopper is at the moment starved of a discounted, value product offer. A Lidl or an Aldi could be very successful in India.\" Thomas Varghese, CEO of another Indian retailer, Aditya Birla, said the power given to states could be a short-term hurdle, but he predicted most would say yes to supermarkets. \"It most definitely will have an impact and reduce the number of places where foreign retailers can set up shop, but it will still not reduce the interest because 51 cities have a million-plus population,\" he said. In the past, big-ticket reforms have been held back by the devil in the detail. In 2008, the government passed the U.S. civilian nuclear deal aimed at opening up India\\'s nuclear power market to foreign players, hailed as the cornerstone of India\\'s warming ties with the United States. But investments have since languished due to stringent accident liability clauses that U.S. companies say make it too risky to invest.

      "{'text': ' Euro zone states may ditch plans to impose losses on private bondholders should countries need to restructure their debt under a new bailout fund due to launch in mid-2013, four EU officials told Reuters on Friday. \\n Discussions are taking place against a backdrop of flagging market confidence in the region\\'s debt and as part of wider negotiations over introducing stricter fiscal rules to the EU treaty. Euro zone powerhouse Germany is insisting on tighter budgets and private sector involvement (PSI) in bailouts as a precondition for deeper economic integration among euro zone countries. Commercial banks and insurance companies are still expected to take a hit on their holdings of Greek sovereign bonds as part of the second bailout package being finalized for Athens. But clauses relating to PSI in the statutes of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - the permanent facility scheduled to start operating from July 2013 - could be withdrawn, with the majority of euro zone states now opposed to them. The concern is that forcing the private sector bondholders to take losses if a country restructures its debt is undermining confidence in euro zone sovereign bonds. If those stipulations are removed, most countries in the euro zone argue, market sentiment might improve. \"France, Italy, Spain and all the peripherals\" are in favor of removing the clauses, one EU official told Reuters. \"Against it are Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.\" Austria is also opposed, another source said. A third official said that while German insistence on retaining private sector involvement in the ESM was fading, collective action clauses would only be removed as part of broader negotiations under way over changes to the EU treaty. Berlin wants all 27 EU countries, or at least the 17 in the euro zone, to provide full backing for alterations to the treaty before it will consider giving ground on other issues member states want it to shift on, officials say. Germany is under pressure to soften its opposition to the European Central Bank playing a more direct role in combating the crisis, and member states also want Berlin to give its backing to the idea of jointly issued euro zone bonds. German officials dismiss any suggestion of a \\'grand bargain\\' being put together, but officials in other euro zone capitals, including Brussels, say such a deal is taking shape and suggest Berlin will move when it has the commitments it is seeking, although it\\'s unclear when that will be. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after meeting French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Strasbourg on Thursday that there was no quid pro quo being set up. \"This is not about give and take,\" she said. Euro zone finance ministers will discuss the ESM at a meeting in Brussels on November 29-30, including the implications of dropping collective action clauses from its statutes. COMPLICATIONS While most euro zone countries just want to forget about enforced private sector involvement, some are adamant that there must be a way to ensure banks and not just taxpayers shoulder some of the costs of bailing countries out. Austria\\'s opposition Green Party, whose support the government needs to secure backing for the ESM in the Vienna parliament, insists collective action clauses must remain a part of the ESM. It\\'s also far from unclear whether the finance committee of the German lower house Bundestag would agree to such changes being made to the ESM. Any changes to the mechanism would have to be approved by all member states and ratified by national parliaments before they can take effect, meaning fixed Austrian and German opposition could derail the push for changes. Germany and some other member states were hoping to bring the ESM, which will have a lending capacity of 500 billion euros, into force as early as July next year, but disagreement over its structure could delay that.

      "{'text': ' Europe has still not found a solution to its sovereign debt crisis that would restore investor confidence, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Friday, advocating greater integration as the way to move forward. \\n \"The truth is, that so far there is no response to the sovereign (debt) crisis that restores confidence to investors,\" Barroso told journalists on the fringes of a conference in Portugal. \"As long as that does not happen we will have very serious problems and debates in Europe.\" Asked about the role of the European Central Bank, which many economists say has to adopt a role of lender of last resort to resolve the crisis, Barroso said the bank had to remain independent. \"I can say that in the Commission, we always respected the independence of the European Central Bank, it is essential to have an independent central bank which is not subject to political pressure,\" he said. Germany has strongly resisted any suggestions that the central bank act as lender of last resort for indebted countries or carry out so-called \\'quantitative easing\\' like the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England have done to support their economies. \"We have confidence that the European Central Bank will carry out its role as it has done so far,\" Barroso said. Barroso defended the Commission\\'s proposal, launched this week, on the issue of joint euro bonds as one possible solution to the crisis, which has been opposed by Germany. On Wednesday, the Commission, the EU\\'s executive arm, proposed intrusive laws to ensure budgets of euro zone countries do not break European Union rules and that their borrowing falls, which, once in place, could lead to joint debt issuance. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said it was \"extraordinarily inappropriate\" for the European Commission to make proposals for joint bond issuance at this stage, but Barroso did not see Germany\\'s stance as a major problem. \"Germany\\'s position as far as I know, is that euro bonds can be considered when there is greater integration and discipline in the euro zone, so we are not that far apart,\" Barroso said. \"We though it was the time to launch the discussion. We, in the Commission, have the duty to launch and propose ideas and afterwards, obviously, it is up to member states to adopt them or not.\" Merkel said this week that changing the European treaty to pave the way for closer European integration was vital to solving the debt crisis and restoring investor confidence. Barroso said the Commission was open to the idea of revising European treaties to find a solution to the crisis but any changes should only be carried out in order to deepen integration. \"The European Commission is open to treaty revision if it is to reinforce and to give greater governance and more integration in the euro zone, and not to divide Europe,\" he said.

      "{'text': ' A behind-the-scenes tussle for control over a 7.5 billion euro ($10 billion) share sale by Italy\\'s Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ) has shown how increasingly tense market conditions are driving a wedge between investment banks. \\n When the opportunity to be involved in a big deal comes along, banks are usually quick to pile in, with fees, league table credit and client relationships to play for, as well as all-important kudos. But the risk in taking on any transaction in such uncertain markets, let alone underwriting the shares of an Italian bank at a time when Italy\\'s economy is being sucked ever deeper into the euro zone debt crisis, has brought strains to the fore. U.S. heavyweights Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan considered the risk involved in Unicredit\\'s offering too great for the potential reward on offer, according to a report by IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. The 14-strong syndicate of banks appointed will underwrite between 700 million and 850 million euros worth of shares each and will receive fees between 2 and 2.5 percent, said a person close to Unicredit who attended the meeting with the banks. That source said that when Goldman Sachs was declined a controlling role it then linked up with Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan to present themselves as alternative global co-ordinators of the share sale and requested a vote. When that vote failed, the three U.S. banks walked away. All three later tried to reopen negotiations but only J.P. Morgan was successful in securing an underwriting position, the source said. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. PLAYING HARDBALL Long-time advisor Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) ( BAC.N ) was appointed as global coordinator alongside Mediobanca ( MDBI.MI ), in which Unicredit owns an 8.7 percent stake, and Unicredit itself. BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, JP Morgan, Societe Generale and UBS as joint bookrunners have a lesser role, while ING, RBC, RBS and Santander are co-bookrunners. As the most senior role in a syndicate, global coordinators have the greatest say in running of the offering -- including, crucially, if and when to push ahead with it. But having Unicredit and Mediobanca in this position made the U.S. banks wary about how much say they would have, according to other sources close to the negotiations. One of those sources said the U.S. banks were uncomfortable about relying on risk assessments by banks that were very close to Unicredit. The three banks were also concerned about BoAML\\'s long-standing ties with Unicredit through Italian lead banker Andrea Orcel, the sources added. The U.S. banks wanted to increase the financial protection in case the transaction didn\\'t go through, the first source, close to Unicredit, said. Shares in Unicredit, which holds 40 billion euros of Italian government bonds, have lost half their value this year, leaving its fundraising worth around 50 percent of its market value, and making it painfully dilutive for investors. A rights issue by fellow Italian bank Banca Popolare di Milano ( PMII.MI ) last week fell 146 million euros short of its 800 million target, with investors taking up only 81.7 percent of the shares on offer. \"At the last minute they got hung up on a couple of legalistic issues and thought that given the situation is so uncertain they could get some concessions from Unicredit by playing hardball,\" said a separate source close to the deal . Such wrangling is not uncommon when companies are under pressure to raise capital.

      "{'text': ' A global accounting rule that was rehashed under pressure from policymakers in the financial crisis has to be revised, sparking industry fears it could make standard setters vulnerable again to political influence. \\n In late 2009 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) revamped the first part of its \"fair value\" or mark-to-market rule which governs when and how banks in over 100 countries must price assets on their books at the going rate. Policymakers in the EU and elsewhere said at the time the existing rule forced banks to price assets at depressed values causing more volatility when markets were already fragile. IASB Chairman Hans Hoogervorst said on Friday the revamped IFRS 9 rule, which is likely to take effect in 2015, will be reworked even though countries like Australia already use it. In a speech in Melbourne, Australia, Hoogervorst said further changes would make IFRS 9 fit better with a separate reform of insurance accounting and help bridge a gap with a U.S. fair value accounting rule reform. World leaders want the IASB and its U.S. counterpart to \"converge\" their rules. \"We gradually came to the conclusion that we could make a lot of progress on both these issues -- insurance and convergence -- by adapting IFRS 9 in a limited way,\" Hoogervorst said. \"It was not an easy decision to make. Most importantly because we knew that our constituents that have already adopted might not be very happy,\" Hoogervorst added. The former Dutch finance minister, who took up the reins earlier this year, hoped for only limited tweaks but \"in practice pressure for wider changes will undoubtedly be there\". He promised to \"proceed with caution and limit any changes to those that are absolutely necessary.\" Ed Nusbaum, chief executive of auditor Grant Thornton, said the IASB should stick to market value assessments of bank assets. \"We want to make sure the IASB stays independent and the standards being set are not overly influenced by political influence to try to make banks and other institutions look better than they really are,\" Nusbaum told Reuters. REAL GREEK VALUE IFRS 9 will replace the IASB\\'s current \"fair value\" rule known as IAS 39. Hoogervorst complained in August to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) that some banks in the EU were failing to apply the rule properly to avoid large writdowns on holdings of sovereign debt in Greece, which is receiving a second bail out from the EU. At the end of June markets were showing a 50 percent discount on Greek sovereign debt but French banks wrote down their holdings by much less than this while in Britain and Germany regulators insisted on full market value writedowns. \"It has been observed that there are differences regarding recognition or non-recognition of impairment losses,\" ESMA said on Friday in a study on Greek debt writedowns which named no banks or EU member states. Two financial institutions showed no impairment at all even though ESMA concluded \"there was objective evidence of impairment of Greek sovereign bonds as of 30 June 2011). \"Issuers should have provided indications on the facts and circumstances and the conditions that existed at that date in their reports,\" ESMA added. ESMA noted its study will be \"relevant\" for banks and auditors preparing full annual statements for 2011, due early next year. \"While one can always debate the percentage of the impairment, the first question was  it impaired and the accountants clearly said in an almost united way that it was indeed impaired,\" Grant Thornton\\'s Nusbaum said. \"That is important going forward in looking at Greek debt but it\\'s too early to make an assessment about Italy and others,\" Nusbaum said.

      "{'text': ' Troubles in the subprime mortgage sector could put Wall Street on edge this week just as investors look for key economic data, including the Consumer Price Index, to shore up the market\\'s nascent recovery after its recent plunge. \\n\\n\\n Fanning concerns about the sector that lends to home buyers with poor credit is this last week\\'s precipitous slide in the stock of New Century Financial Corp. NEW.N amid fears that the lender could file for bankruptcy protection. The subprime lender said on Thursday it had stopped accepting new loans. Even after saying it had lined up $265 million in funding, New Century disclosed it was negotiating for further relief. Investors worry that fallout from rising loan defaults in the subprime market could hurt consumer confidence as lenders tighten credit amid the housing slowdown. Wall Street keeps a close watch on the moods and habits of consumers because their spending is a key driver of U.S. economic growth and corporate profitability. \"The worst thing that could happen to any economy is the loss of confidence,\" said Med Yones, president of the International Institute of Management, an economic research and forecasting group in Las Vegas. He said the bursting of the real estate bubble and high consumer debt were a major worry and \"if people started to think there may be a lot of bankruptcies (in the subprime lending market), then you\\'re going to see the stock market sell off.\" SUBPRIME TIME This week could give Wall Street more insight into the extent of the subprime lending woes as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N and Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N are due to kick off the quarterly earnings reporting season for big investment banks this week. Wall Street\\'s big banks buy mortgages from lenders and package them into mortgage-backed bonds. \"The possibility of (New Century) declaring bankruptcy is certainly raised by what they said\" last week, said Michael James, senior trader of regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan, in Los Angeles. \"I think the potential fallout from what might happen with New Century over the weekend and its effect on the fixed-income market are certainly part of the\" worry, James added. On Friday, stocks finished mixed as concerns about the subprime mortgage market took a toll and curbed some of the optimism created by February\\'s healthy jobs data. For the past week, all three U.S. stock indexes rose: The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 1.34 percent, the Standard & Poor\\'s 500  .SPX  advanced 1.13 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 0.83 percent. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 broke a two-week losing streak. AN INFLATION SNAPSHOT Besides fretting about housing woes, investors will brace themselves this week for a barrage of economic data that could yield crucial clues about the health of the U.S. economy and the future direction of U.S. interest rates. The week\\'s most closely watched report is likely to be the Consumer Price Index for February, due on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast an increase of 0.3 percent in February\\'s overall CPI, after January\\'s 0.2 percent gain. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, February\\'s core CPI is seen up 0.2 percent. In January, it rose 0.3 percent. A preliminary look at March consumer sentiment will be provided on Friday by the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. The consumer sentiment index is forecast to dip to 90.0 in March from 91.3 in February. The Federal Reserve\\'s February report on industrial production and capacity utilization is also on Friday\\'s data menu. The Reuters poll forecast: Industrial production, up 0.2 percent after January\\'s decline of 0.5 percent, and capacity utilization is pegged at 81.3 vs. 81.2 previously. On Thursday, Wall Street will get the U.S. Producer Price Index for February, which measures wholesale prices. The forecast: Overall PPI, up 0.5 percent in February, after January\\'s 0.6 percent drop. Core PPI is forecast to rise 0.2 percent in February, matching January\\'s gain. With inflation on Wall Street\\'s mind, investors will still keep track of oil prices. On Friday, NYMEX April crude CLJ7 ended at $60.05 a barrel, down 2.6 percent for the week. On Tuesday, February retail sales are due. The Reuters poll showed economists forecast a gain of 0.3 percent in retail sales, both including and excluding auto sales. On Monday, Federal Reserve Board Governor Randall Kroszner is scheduled to speak on \"Inflation Dynamics\" at a conference for the National Association for Business Economics. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART Last week marked Wall Street\\'s attempt to reverse a slide it suffered a week earlier, which began when China\\'s main stock index suffered its biggest drop in a decade. Investors sold stocks as a dwindling appetite for risk and concerns about economic growth triggered a flight into safe-haven assets like government bonds, wiping out the stock market\\'s 2007 gains. The rebound has been punctuated by rising volatility, raising doubt about its sustainability. But money managers and analysts said longer term, the stock market is still poised to rise this year as share valuations fall into line with expectations. \"Over time, you have to realize that the reason you get superior returns in the market is because you have to endure higher volatility. That\\'s the price of admission,\" said Rafael Resendes, co-founder and president of The Applied Finance Group, a capital market research and consulting firm in Fresno, California. \"For the investors, I would say nothing has changed, except maybe you re-evaluate your asset-allocation scheme, maybe buy more on the dips,\" Resendes said. \"But for a trader, obviously, there\\'s going to be a lot of opportunities that arise as the market readjusts and gets used to a world of higher volatility.\" And speaking of volatility, Friday marks the quarterly expiration and settlement of four different types of March futures and options contracts -- a convergence known as quadruple witching.

TRB.N private in a transaction valued at about $13 billion, according to financial newspaper Barron\\'s. \\n\\n\\n Citing a person familiar with the ongoing auction, Barron\\'s reported in its latest edition that Zell would personally put in as much as $300 million toward his proposal and has commitments from lenders for all the debt required. Tribune was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Zell declined to comment. Crain\\'s Chicago Business reported on March 1 that Zell has publicly acknowledged for the first time that he may make a bid to buy Tribune. Without providing details, Zell, speaking at a real estate industry event, confirmed that his plan involved creating an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and that the ownership would be \"a partnership between myself and the ESOP,\" Crain\\'s reported. Zell\\'s plan would hand majority control of the company to the ESOP in return for the company being able to use the tax deductions generation by the ESOP to sweeten the share price that Tribune could pay existing shareholders, according to Barron\\'s. Barron\\'s reported that Zell wants to become chairman of the surviving entity. Chicago-based Tribune is reviewing bids that include buying out the company and spinning off divisions as it tries to satisfy restive investors. It is expected to decide by the end of the month. Tribune has been mulling a management-led plan to restructure after bids from billionaires Eli Broad and Ron Burkle and entertainment mogul David Geffen failed to impress a special committee of Tribune\\'s board evaluating its options. Tribune put itself up for sale after its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trust, proposed the company take itself private for about $7.6 billion, or $31.70 a share. Tribune shares closed up 62 cents, or 2 percent, at $30.55 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. According to a report last week in the Los Angeles Times, a Tribune paper, Zell is seen as a strong contender to buy the media company. Tribune owns daily papers in such cities as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as about two dozen television stations and the Chicago Cubs professional baseball team.

Investors hoping for a better deal have kept Nikko\\'s shares above Citigroup\\'s offer price since the U.S. banking group unveiled its bid last Tuesday. Nikko\\'s shares rose 3 percent to 1,410 yen on Friday. Three other major shareholders have also objected to the bid price.

I don\\'t. Something has to change,\" EU Consumer Protection Commissioner Kuneva was quoted as saying in a preview of an interview to be published on Monday. Apple could not be immediately reached for comment on the report. Norway, a European country that is not in the EU, is battling Apple for the same reason. In January, it said the computer and software giant must liberalize its music download system by October 1 or face legal action. Pressure on Apple has been building, with consumer rights organizations from Germany, France, Finland and Norway recently agreeing a joint position in their battles against iTunes. They argue that Apple uses digital rights technology to limit consumers\\' free use of songs bought on iTunes, including the ability to copy and transfer songs to other users and other MP3 devices besides the Apple iPod. Both at the national and EU levels, however, the issue has been looked at by consumer agencies rather than the competition watchdogs whose role it is to decide whether a business activity violates rules on fair competition. A Commission spokeswoman in Brussels confirmed Kuneva\\'s comment reported by the magazine but said it represented the commissioner\\'s personal views, not those of the Commission. \"I don\\'t think she was stating it as a definitive policy position. At this stage it is her gut instinct,\" spokeswoman Helen Kearns said. Kuneva is leading a review of the eight basic laws which govern cross-border consumer rights. That review, which has just begun and has so far resulted in a preliminary document raising questions, will eventually lead to proposed revisions of current EU laws, the spokeswoman said.

An analyst said the move made sense. \"The company as a whole has continued to diversify internationally, and the Middle East is a point that they have targeted,\" said William Sanchez, a U.S.-based analyst at Howard Weil Inc. \"They are being opportunistic in putting the CEO in the middle of the action.\" During 2006, more than 38 percent of Halliburton\\'s $13 billion in oil services revenue was generated in the Eastern Hemisphere. Sanchez said he believed Halliburton\\'s move to Dubai is not tax related. Instead he views it as a strategic play. Lesar said Halliburton is considering listing its shares on one of the Middle East bourses as it looks at growth potential in the hemisphere. \"One of the things that we would like to pursue ... is a listing of our shares in the Middle East,\" Lesar said on the sidelines of the event. Halliburton has not yet decided in which country it would list its shares. \"At this point in time we clearly see there are greater opportunities in the Eastern Hemisphere than the Western Hemisphere,\" he told reporters. GROWTH Halliburton would spend a large part of its $1.4 billion investment budget for the year in the Middle East, he said. Oil and gas service companies have hiked prices for their services over the past two years as the sector strains to bring enough capacity on line to meet rapidly rising demand. Many new supply projects are in the oil-producing countries of the Middle East, while Asia accounts for most of the rising demand. In contrast, a slide in natural gas prices in the United States has prompted investor concern that oil and gas companies might cut back on spending in North America. Halliburton has long been involved in the Middle East energy sector. KBR Inc., the engineering and military-services contractor unit that Halliburton is in the process of splitting off, is the Pentagon\\'s largest contractor in Iraq. The company has faced several investigations into alleged overbilling there, as well as for its links to Iran, where U.S. companies are forbidden from operating.

But the bank, which was put on the ropes when the recession hit its lower-income borrowers especially hard, was unable to secure the funds it was seeking from the government\\'s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, it needed to match private-sector pledges. ShoreBank\\'s deposits will be taken over by a newly chartered institution called Urban Partnership Bank (UPB). Its 15 branches also will shift to the new bank. William Farrow, a former banker with First Chicago Corp, will be president and chief executive of UPB and David Vitale, former executive chairman of ShoreBank, will be chairman. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said ShoreBank had $2.16 billion in assets and $1.54 billion in deposits as of June 30. The FDIC estimated that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of the failure will be $367.7 million. \"Compared to other alternatives, Urban Partnership Bank\\'s acquisition was the least costly resolution,\" the FDIC said in a statement. Urban Partnership Bank will pay the FDIC a premium of 0.50 percent to assume all of the deposits of ShoreBank and in addition will purchase \"essentially all of the assets except for the marketable securities and fixed assets,\" the agency said. The FDIC and Urban Partnership Bank also entered into a loss-share transaction covering $1.41 billion of ShoreBank\\'s assets. UPB will have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 percent and sufficient capital to meet pre-opening expenses, projected growth and overall capital needs, UPB said in a statement. The new bank was \"capitalized by financial institutions, philanthropic organizations and socially responsible individuals from Chicago and nationally,\" it said. ShoreBank is one of the larger banks to fail in recent months and the 114th FDIC-insured institution shut down so far this year. Seven other U.S. banks closed on Friday in Virginia, California and Florida as the community bank sector continues to struggle with poorly performing loans and recovers at a pace that lags behind that of Wall Street and the larger economy. Los Padres Bank, Solvang, California, Independent National Bank, Ocala, Florida and Imperial Savings and Loan Association, Martinsville, Virginia, were among the banks that were closed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said. Small banks are collapsing at a faster pace this year compared to last, but regulators expect the closures to peak this quarter. Attempts to rescue ShoreBank have played out in the media for months, with lawmakers and watchdogs questioning whether special treatment was being given to the bank. ShoreBank is located on Chicago\\'s South Side near the home base of President Barack Obama and some of his top aides, and the bank has promoted on its website connections to Obama. ShoreBank has received national recognition over the years for its efforts to extend loans to low-income communities and environmental cause. It has some prominent supporters with strong ties to Washington, including Ellen Seidman, former director of the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision, and Eugene Ludwig, former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who represents Chicago\\'s North Side, lobbied Wall Street banks this year to save the 37-year-old bank. She has blamed Wall Street\\'s \"recklessness\" for the foreclosure crisis that precipitated ShoreBank\\'s losses. But bank activity with a philanthropic bent has not been profitable lately. For the quarter ending March 31, ShoreBank reported a $17.1 million operating loss, compared with an operating profit of $384,000 in the year-earlier period. UPB \"will focus on providing continued availability of financial services for low and moderate income communities\" in Chicago, Cleveland and Detroit, the bank said. \"The private investment in this new financial institution demonstrates commitment to restoring the economic vitality of our communities,\" Vitale said in a statement.', 'date': ' Sat Aug 21, 2010 1:01am EDT\\n', 'title': ' Regulators close ShoreBank in Chicago\\n', 'author': ' By  Nick Carey\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/08/21/us-shorebank-failure-idUSTRE67J5AE20100821\\n\\n \\n\\n CHICAGO  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' The CEO of the world\\'s fourth-largest maker of liquid crystal displays has been barred by a federal judge from leaving the United States as Justice Department officials pursue price-fixing allegations against the company. \\n\\n A grand jury indicted Lai-Juh Chen, chief executive officer of Taiwan\\'s AU Optronics Corp ( 2409.TW ) ( AUO.N ), in June for fixing prices of thin-film LCD panels, which go into everything from TVs to smartphones. The court ordered him to surrender his passport this week. The U.S. Justice Department has accused AU Optronics executives of participating in a group of industry officials who met regularly in Taipei hotel rooms and restaurants to discuss and agree on prices, from 2001 to 2006. Six companies had pleaded guilty in the subsequent probe, including Taiwan\\'s Chi Mei ( 3481.TW ) and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd ( 2475.TW ), South Korea\\'s LG Display ( 034220.KS ) Co Ltd, and Japan\\'s Sharp Corp ( 6753.T ), Epson Imaging Devices, and Hitachi Displays. After Chen pleaded not guilty in San Francisco last month, his lawyers argued that as the case proceeds, he should be allowed to travel between the United States and Asia to attend important meetings. \"One such meeting is scheduled in September with top officials of customer LG Electronics ( 066570.KS ) in Korea,\" his lawyers wrote. \"If Dr. Chen was unable to personally attend these meetings as CEO, it would be more difficult for AU to conclude agreement with customers or, potentially, it could risk losing substantial business to competitors.\" In Taiwan, an AU Optronics publicist said the firm\\'s business would see little impact from the case as many of Chen\\'s senior deputies remain on the island. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered Chen and AU\\'s vice chairman, Hsuan Bin Chen, to surrender their passports this week, court records indicate. \"Defendants shall not travel outside the Northern District of California\" without the court\\'s permission, Illston wrote. The district stretches from San Jose in California north to the Oregon border, and includes San Francisco. However, Illston quickly approved Chen\\'s request to take a brief domestic trip to Atlanta and Tennessee. WEB WIDENS Prosecutors obtained indictments against four other current and former AU officials, along with the company itself. Another one of those executives now barred from leaving the United States is Hui Hsiung, CEO of Qisda Corp, a Taiwanese manufacturer of electronics components including LCD monitors. A handful of representatives from the Taiwan government attended Hsiung\\'s court hearing to show support for his international travel request, his attorney Brian Berson said. But prosecutors argued that Hsiung and the other AU executives were flight risks, given the lack of an extradition treaty between the United States and Taiwan. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei, capital of self-ruled Taiwan, to Beijing in 1979. Hsiung was disappointed with Illston\\'s ruling, which may force him to resign from Qisda, his lawyer said. So far, 17 executives have been charged in the LCD probe, and the six companies that have pleaded guilty have paid fines totaling more than $860 million. Many executives have pleaded guilty, and their prison sentences usually last a few months. The AU personnel appear to be the first to declare their innocence and fight the charges. AU said in July it saw no material impact on company operations from the indictment, and, denying the charges, pointed out that prices for thin-film LCD panels had fallen steeply in past years. A U.S. lawyer for AU Optronics, a major supplier to the likes of Dell Inc DELL.O, Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ) and Sony Corp ( 6758.T ), declined comment on Friday.

Construction ministers from states governed by Merkel\\'s conservatives as well as those led by the opposition Social Democrats aim to resist cuts worth 2.4 billion euros ($3.1 billion), the weekly news magazine said. These measures would lead to a halt in investment and threaten jobs and tax revenues, the magazine cited a working paper of the ministers as saying. Merkel\\'s center-right government has agreed a four-year, 80 billion euro austerity plan to slash the budget deficit. This push has drawn criticism from politicians at home and from some of Germany\\'s euro zone partners, who say it is unwise to withdraw fiscal stimulus from an economy still recovering from its deepest post-war recession. Although support for the budget cuts has plunged in recent weeks, the government is sticking to its guns and plans to lay out details on implementation at the start of September. Energy policy is a particular area of contention at a time that the cabinet is also preparing to unveil its long-term energy plans. Industry bosses and members of Merkel\\'s own Christian Democrats (CDU) urged her in an open letter on Friday to drop her plan to tax nuclear power providers, saying it would put Germany\\'s future at risk. Michael Fuchs, a deputy head of the CDU in the lower house of parliament, has also urged the government not to pursue its plan to reduce tax breaks for large corporate energy consumers. \"We cannot push energy-intensive companies away from this country with the environmental tax,\" he told Der Spiegel. TAX RELIEF? Germany\\'s robust recovery also has prompted the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), junior coalition partners in Merkel\\'s center-right government, to reiterate calls for tax relief for middle-income earners. \"We can get rid of the solidarity tax (for investment in former East Germany) and relieve citizens by 12 billion euros without threatening the consolidation of state finances,\" FDP finance expert Frank Schaeffler was cited as saying in Wirtschaftswoche magazine on Saturday. The German economy grew at the fastest rate since reunification in the second quarter as companies stepped up investment and exports surged. The FDP had campaigned on a ticket of tax relief, yet Merkel put aside the idea during the euro zone debt crisis and has said she still sees no scope for tax cuts over the next two years. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has also made it clear that consolidation remains the fiscal priority and on Saturday also lowered hopes for a broad simplification of the tax system. \"Many proposals for tax simplifications cannot be carried out without causing a considerable shortfall,\" Schaeuble was cited as saying by Der Spiegel.

      "{'text': ' India\\'s central bank governor Raghuram Rajan may raise policy rates again after shocking markets by increasing them in only his first meeting, signaling he is willing to risk prolonging what is already the lowest economic growth in years in order to quash persistent inflation. \\n Raising the repo rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 percent as India stumbles through its worst economic crisis since 1991 puts pressure on New Delhi to relieve supply-side bottlenecks in the economy, such as poor infrastructure, that keep inflation high even when demand is soft. That is a big ask for a weak coalition government, which also faces a general election by May. Rajan is expected by many in the market to shift the RBI\\'s main inflation gauge to consumer prices from wholesale prices, putting India in line with most big economies but pushing up near-term rate expectations. Consumer price inflation was 9.5 percent for August, meaning the cost of living is rising faster than interest rates. The wholesale price index rose 6.1 percent. \"If he goes ahead and hikes further, which I think he might, then it might affect growth. But ultimately, if you have to bring down inflation, there is no other option,\" said A. Prasanna, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd in Mumbai. A prominent former IMF chief economist who famously predicted the global financial crisis, Rajan took office earlier this month amid much media fanfare and high expectations that he could engineer a turnaround for the sluggish economy and rescue a currency that had fallen as much as 20 percent this year. A flurry of measures by Rajan\\'s predecessor and fresh moves on his first day in office have helped lift the rupee off its record low. Rajan rolled back part of the sharp increase in the marginal standing facility (MSF), an overnight rate, reassuring some in financial markets that the rupee measures are temporary. But in raising the repo rate, traditionally the policy interest rate, Rajan showed the central bank\\'s priority had shifted from defending the rupee to fighting inflation. \"It should bring down inflation expectations and help correct India\\'s macroeconomic imbalances. However, this means severe growth pain in the coming year,\" Nomura analysts wrote. Nomura now expects the RBI to raise the repo rate by another 50 bps in the fiscal year ending in March to take it to 8.00 percent, followed by a lengthy pause. It had previously expected no further rate move this fiscal year followed by 75 bps of cuts in the next fiscal year. It also said there are downward risks to its GDP forecast of 4.2 percent, which would be the lowest in a decade, and 5.1 percent for this fiscal year and next, respectively. Edelweiss Securities, which had expected 50 bps of rate cuts by the end of March, now expects rates to stay unchanged. \\'INTERESTING EXPERIMENT\\' While the U.S. Federal Reserve\\'s decision on Wednesday not to begin unwinding its monetary stimulus fuelled expectations that the RBI would begin cutting the MSF back to its earlier level, not a single analyst in a Reuters poll had predicted that Rajan would increase the repo rate. Lifting rates may compel Indian households to shift more of their savings towards banks and away from real estate and gold, addressing a trend that has pushed down deposit growth. \"I think it\\'s an interesting experiment,\" said Rahul Bajoria, an economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. \"I am not saying whether I know it will work or not, but I think it sort of shows the RBI\\'s hand in the sense that they really want to focus more on the inflation side of things than on growth at this point,\" he said. Also, one of the biggest drivers of inflation in India, the rising cost of food, is generally not sensitive to rates, meaning the net effect of Rajan\\'s policy tightening may be on managing inflation expectations as much as inflation itself. If Rajan raises rates further, he might not do so dramatically. On Friday, he noted that a weak economy can provide a \"cushion in terms of disinflationary processes at work but also will give us an incentive to then perhaps look to putting greater emphasis on reviving the growth of the economy.\" India grew at 4.4 percent in the June quarter, its worst pace in four years. NOT LOOKING FOR \\'LIKES\\' Indian markets took the policy badly, with bonds and stocks plunging and dragging the rupee down with them only a day after a Fed-fuelled rally. Still, in recent weeks the rupee has recovered some of its losses and the sense of crisis surrounding the currency has eased for now. Traders said the 10-year government bond yield - which jumped 39 basis points on Friday - could rise close to 20 basis points this week, partly as the market factors in higher policy rates. Some Indian companies worried the higher rates could prove damaging. Many companies are struggling after the central bank\\'s rupee measures supported the currency but dried up credit. \"Industry is truly concerned about the policy rate hikes and their adverse impact on the investment sentiment,\" Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd ( SREI.NS ) said in a statement. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, who has in the past pushed for pro-growth monetary policy, did not make any public comment on Friday, although several ministry insiders said they were understanding of the challenge Rajan faces. At his first-day press conference earlier this month, Rajan, 50, impressed RBI-watchers with a multi-pronged action plan to bolster the rupee and strengthen financial markets but also warned that he would have to make unpopular decisions, that his job was not to accumulate \"likes\" on Facebook. \"This is possibly the part where the new RBI governor pre-empted that the course of action by the central bank was not to accumulate \"likes\", said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS in Singapore.

      "{'text': ' Despite the rapid pace of technology that has overhauled many consumer goods, the front door lock and key is little changed since the 1800s. That is about to change - to virtual keys in data clouds, if the world\\'s biggest lockmaker gets its way. \\n Assa Abloy, which makes one in ten locks worldwide, is the muscle behind brands such as Yale. But the lock technology it is now developing means consumers will be able to open doors with a tap of their mobile phones, visitors will be able to download a key online and business owners will be able to lock and unlock their premises remotely. \"I think most people will go digital. People will rely more on a secure identity than a physical key, provided over the net into your mobile phone,\" says Johan Molin, Assa Abloy\\'s lean 54-year-old chief executive. Electro-mechanical locks like key cards in hotels now account for almost half of Assa Abloy\\'s sales compared with 13 percent a decade ago, and the company believes this is just the start of growing demand from consumers for more flexible, high-tech locking mechanisms. At its Stockholm headquarters, some of Assa Abloy\\'s staff are trialing different versions of virtual keys downloaded to mobile phones that open a lock simply with a swipe of the phone. The company is also working up versions where phones with bluetooth or wireless links could automatically open doors when within a certain distance. Other keys can be set to switch on at a certain date and expire on another date, meaning someone renting a flat, for example, need no longer hand over physical keys at the end of their stay. The digital keys can be embedded in SIM cards, within software or inside the phone itself, thanks to Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, or short range wireless that within a few years may be standard in most mobile devices. U.S. research firm ABI Research has estimated that the number of NFC enabled devices will exceed 500 million in 2014. The new key technology could also unlock higher recurring revenues. While traditional locks last on average four decades, electro-mechanical locks have lifespans of 10-15 years and software coupled with more fickle consumer electronics means these locks will need to be routinely replaced or updated. It is a model Assa is confident that consumers used to frequently upgrading their phones and tablets will accept. \"People will have the same kind of relationship to their lock that they have to their computer. They will want to have the latest features, designs,\" Molin said. Just this week Apple launched its new iPhone 5S, with a fingerprint scanner, replacing the need for passwords and PIN numbers with biometric security. DRIVING CHANGE But selling locks is a delicate business and the market traditionally conservative. Some consumers, especially in Europe, are reluctant to move from the security of physical keys to a more opaque system, particularly amid worries about cybersecurity. Additionally the cost involved - a digital Yale lock is about 30 percent more expensive than a traditional one - currently limits the technology to high-end households. So Assa Abloy\\'s strategy is to make the technology a good fit with businesses and institutions like hotels, hospitals and schools, which account for three quarters of its sales, in order to \\'normalize\\' the new product, lower costs and ultimately drive broader consumer acceptance. With this in mind the company has boosted research and development spending 129 percent since 2005 and in 2012 spent about $210 million, or 2.9 percent of sales, on R&D. That 2.9 percent is around the industry average for R&D spending, analysts say, as Assa\\'s U.S. rivals in particular, Ingersoll-Rand and Stanley Black & Decker chase the same new markets. \"The challenge for Assa Abloy is to move fast enough,\" said Carlo Pompili, CEO of Swedish startup firm Telcred which is working on new locking technology. \"It\\'s a huge market with many nuances. They cannot think of everything. That opens up space for other companies.\" Alongside its own technological research Assa Abloy says it will continue to do deals that advance its products. \"We of course try and focus on our own innovation,\" says Daniel Berg, vice-president of Assa Abloy mobile keys. \"But complementary acquisitions could happen if there is a start-up with a great idea.\" The company has a long history of buying up competitors. More than ten years ago it bought U.S. firm HID, an early secure ID card producer, giving it a big advantage in a market providing secure computer access that subsequently boomed. It then bought up U.S.-based ActivID in 2010, adding a layer of more sophisticated digital identity recognition to that product line. With an eye on its current direction, Assa Abloy reached a deal in 2012 with Oberthur, a leading manufacturer of SIM cards, allowing it to embed its digital keys in Oberthur\\'s cards. A consumer buying Oberthur\\'s product need only then buy an App to get access to Assa Abloy\\'s key code. There are newer and smaller competitors pushing forward in this area, like U.S.-based Lockitron, which makes devices to lock and unlock deadbolts via remote control, or Spain\\'s Salto, making lock software tailored to businesses. But in a still-developing market few can compete with Assa Abloy\\'s reach. \"High-tech locks, using phones, etc, are the future, but the question is how fast it will grow?\" said Oscar Stjerngren, an analyst at Danske Bank. \"Assa Abloy are so dominant globally they can drive this transition in the high-tech lock market.\" OLD & NEW Global reach means catering to a rich mix of national nuances that in turn require a combination of products - so Assa Abloy is not turning its back on traditional security just yet. North American consumers still spend twice as much on \"emergency exit devices\" such as fire escape doors than Europeans. Northern Europeans spend three to four times as much on high security household locks than North Americans. \"In America it\\'s all about getting out. In Europe it is all about avoiding people getting in,\" Molin said. The company\\'s most recent buy was more traditional hardware - in September it acquired the firedoors business of Polish-based Mercor to give it access to growing markets in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is also planning acquisitions of hardware manufacturers and traditional locksmiths in China, South America and India, though demand for digital locks is growing fast in the first two of those markets. Demand for high-tech security is particularly strong in Brazil, where violent crime is common. Not only is fingerprinting identification for cash withdrawal machines becoming popular, but banks and consumers are requesting an extra layer of security that allows the machines to analyze blood vessels in the finger to recognize whether the person to whom it belongs is alive or dead.

      "{'text': ' An incentive program for first-time car buyers in Thailand has backfired with more than 100,000 indebted consumers defaulting, leaving the big global manufacturers that dominate Southeast Asia\\'s largest auto market struggling to defend their margins. \\n The tax breaks, which the World Bank estimates cost Thailand $2.5 billion, were intended to revive auto manufacturing in the region\\'s biggest car-making hub following devastating floods in 2011. But much like the U.S. \"cash for clunkers\" program in 2009, the incentives distorted the market, creating a boom in demand that collapsed once the tax breaks expired in December. Research from IHS Global Automotive shows around 10 percent of the 1.2 million Thais who signed on to the incentive scheme have either changed their minds or couldn\\'t pay monthly installments. Japanese automakers, who control 80 percent of the local market, reported a 30 percent drop in sales on average in the second quarter of 2013. Once buyers canceled, the vehicles were seized by auto finance companies and sold as used cars. \"Our prices have plummeted. On average they\\'ve fallen 20 percent this year,\" said Narongrod Chataratipa, general manager of Center Used Car which operates two showrooms in Bangkok. \"Some smaller dealers struggled to survive and shut down. Now that people realize they can\\'t afford to pay, their barely used cars are on the market, driving down prices even further.\" MARKET GLUT The glut of almost-new vehicles hitting the market has had a knock-on effect of automakers, who are being forced to offer promotions or discounts to move stock. Mitsubishi Motors MMOTH.UL ( 7211.T ), which operates three vehicle plants in the kingdom, said April-to-June Thai sales dropped 24 percent year-on-year to around 20,800 vehicles and it expects further falls. \"The end of the incentives scheme created an irregularity which may trade off the benefits to some extent. We\\'ve come to see it as an unavoidable cost of the program,\" said Nobuyuki Murahashi, President of Mitsubishi Motors (Thailand). Mitsubishi, Thailand\\'s largest exporter of cars, has launched sales promotions around the country, including lucky draws and a no-interest payment scheme spread over 48 months. U.S. brands like Chevrolet and Ford ( F.N ) have a much smaller share of the Thai market, although they have made advances in recent years. Laurent Berthet, director of communications in Southeast Asia for Chevrolet-maker General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), said the market had been struggling over the last three months. \"Of course, it implies everybody must be extremely cautious,\" he said. \"It obliges us to work closely with our dealers to get new models out there and attract interest from our customers.\" Often referred to as the \"Detroit of Southeast Asia\", auto manufacturing is Thailand\\'s third-largest industry and accounts for 12 percent of gross domestic product. Car production surged 70 percent in 2012 from the previous year\\'s flood-constrained output, to 2.43 million vehicles, according to the Paris-based International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. This year it is expected to exceed 2.5 million vehicles, but with domestic demand falling automakers will need to ship more to export markets in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia. \"FINANCIAL SUICIDE\" Nitipon Chamnansilp, a 28-year-old graphic designer, signed on to the incentive plan that offered a tax refund of up to 100,000 baht ($3,200). His computer screen saver still shows his dream car: a modest Honda. \"I knew exactly which car I wanted and paid a booking deposit,\" said Nitipon. \"But living costs have gone up since then and I already have monthly installments to pay for my apartment. Adding another payment would be financial suicide.\" Thailand\\'s household debt is equivalent to nearly 80 percent of gross domestic product, among the highest in Asia. Last month the central bank expressed concerns over the impact of potential defaults in auto loans that could \"adversely affect prices of second-hand cars and potentially lenders\". Critics have compared the car scheme to other populist policies of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra\\'s government including a rice buying scheme to aid farmers that has cost at least $4.46 billion since it was introduced in 2011. \"The tax refund scheme not only distorted the auto market, it also used the national budget to compensate losses from excise tax,\" said Jessada Thongpak, a Bangkok-based senior analyst at IHS Automotive. Supporters say the plan gave a much-needed boost to the big Japanese manufacturers - domestic sales of passenger cars more than doubled year-on-year in 2012, according the Thai Automotive Institute. \"There will be payment defaults and we might have a trough but overall it was good that the government did this scheme because the industry came to its absolute capacity limit,\" said Uli Kaiser, president of industry analysts the Automotive Focus Group Thailand. \"Never had Thailand produced so many cars.\" Although sales have dropped for four consecutive months, they are still running well ahead of the 700,000 units sold in 2010, the year before the plan was launched. GREEN FUTURE Undaunted by the mixed results of the first incentive scheme, the Thai government is pressing ahead with phase two of a green car program that offers tax breaks to manufacturers of environmentally-friendly and compact vehicles. The scheme\\'s first phase saw auto giants Suzuki Motor Corp ( 7269.T ), Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ), Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) and Mitsubishi join, and its second phase has attracted interest from European car makers such as Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ). Thailand\\'s Board of Investment, a government agency that promotes local and foreign investment, estimates that the country will produce 700,000 eco-cars by 2015. Research from IHS shows domestic demand for such vehicles is already trailing production by half, suggesting automakers may once again be stuck with unwanted supplies. Those green cars may find their way into Southeast Asian neighbor Indonesia, which boasts a potential car market - based on population - almost four times the size of Thailand\\'s but just half the auto manufacturing capacity. Kaiser, from the Automotive Focus Group, said Thailand remained vital to Japanese automakers as a regional export base. \"The Japanese have strong interests in playing down the growth perspectives of Southeast Asia because they have a lot to lose. It is the only place, apart from South Korea and Japan, where the Europeans play no significant role,\" said Kaiser. \"What Mexico is for the U.S, Thailand is for the Japanese. Thailand is their Mexico.\" ($1 = 31.7300 Thai baht) (Additional reporting by Pairat Temphairojana in Bangkok and  Yoko Kubota  in Tokyo; Editing by  Emily Kaiser  and  Alex Richardson )', 'date': ' Sun Sep 22, 2013 5:16pm EDT\\n', 'title': \" Car buyers' incentive plan backfires in Southeast Asia's Detroit\\n\", 'author': ' By Amy Sawitta Lefevre\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/22/us-thailand-autos-idUSBRE98L0JJ20130922\\n\\n \\n\\n BANGKOK  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Italian Economy Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni will resign if the fragile coalition government flouts European Union deficit spending limits in favor of tax cuts, he told Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday. \\n The departure of Saccomanni, a former high ranking Bank of Italy official who is not affiliated to a political party, would be a blow to Italy\\'s credibility with financial markets as it battles to emerge from its longest recession in six decades. Italy\\'s accounts are heading toward overshooting the EU deficit limit this year, Saccomanni said on Friday, just months after the country was taken off a black list for running excessive budget gaps in the past. While the minister said he would do all it takes to keep the deficit below the 3 percent of output ceiling, senior coalition members have pledged to go ahead with tax cuts amid a growing sense that a national election may be just a few months away. \"Promises must be kept, otherwise I\\'m not staying,\" Saccomanni was quoting saying in an interview with Corriere. \"I must defend my credibility, and I have no political ambitions.\" Prime Minister Enrico Letta\\'s government has been in near constant turmoil since it was formed five months ago by the country\\'s two biggest parties, traditionally bitter rivals. Letta\\'s Democratic Party (PD) and Silvio Berlusconi\\'s Forza Italia (FI) agreed to govern together after an inconclusive national vote in February, but both sides appear to be mulling an early vote as a way out of the awkward alliance. \"I\\'m not going to make a desperate search for a billion euros if in February there\\'s going to be a vote,\" Saccomanni was said to say in the Corriere, explaining that reforms and the management of the public accounts required political stability. To meet the EU deficit target, Saccomanni needs 1.4 billion euros and he indicated a one-percentage-point increase of the main sales-tax rate of 21 percent scheduled for October 1 cannot be cancelled without worsening the public accounts. The economic policy impasse comes at an especially bad moment for the coalition. Berlusconi is reeling from a definitive conviction for tax fraud last month and an impending vote to strip him of his Senate seat, and the PD is torn by an internal power struggle between Letta and Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi, with a primary vote to pick a new leader set for December 8. Letta is travelling to the United States and Canada this week, but will return Friday to preside over a cabinet meeting where a decision over the sales-tax increase must be taken. SLOGANS AND PROPAGANDA Saccomanni toned down his threat later on Sunday in comments from the sidelines of a conference in Tuscany. \"The moment has come to have a calm and serious debate over the public accounts,\" Saccomanni said in comments broadcast by SkyTG24. \"Italians deserve to know exactly how things stand instead of hearing only slogans and propaganda.\" Letta fully supports his Economy Minister, a source in the prime minister\\'s office said. \"We will not continue to be part of a coalition whose government wants to raise taxes on Italians,\" Daniela Santanche, an influential lawmaker close to Berlusconi who favors an early vote, said on Sunday, urging the minister to step down. But Renato Brunetta, FI\\'s group leader in the lower house, was conciliatory after having repeatedly said in recent weeks the survival of the government depended on the cancellation of the value-added tax (VAT) hike. In an interview broadcast on state TV, Brunetta said he did not want Saccomanni to resign and that he was confident the VAT increase would be averted. Deputy Economy Minister Stefano Fassina of the PD warned an early vote would be \"irresponsible\", but he said funding could be found to head off the sales-tax increase. It would cost about 1 billion euros to cancel the sales-tax hike, but another newspaper, Il Messaggero, estimated on Sunday that Saccomanni needed a total of 6 billion euros by the end of the year to meet the deficit target while funding other promised measures, including the country\\'s military missions abroad.

      "{'text': ' Few companies showed up to Afghanistan\\'s fresh appeal for investment in its vast mineral wealth on Sunday, apparently deterred by trouble plaguing two of its largest projects and allowing small firms to emerge as the main contenders. \\n The Mines Ministry pleaded to a handful of local and foreign firms to bid on a near billion dollar cement tender, luring interest with attractive terms like free currency conversions and 100 percent capital repatriation. Hopes are pinned on Afghanistan\\'s trillion dollar wealth in resources weaning the country off international aid, but early attempts to unlock its potential have hit serious setbacks. These appeared to have deterred major international firms from attending - leaving the path open to small investors with unconventional backgrounds, prepared to take on deteriorating security and uncertainty ahead of next year\\'s election. Afghanistan has been at war for decades. It is now trying to inject life into attempts to negotiate an end to an Islamist Taliban insurgency as most NATO combat troops prepare to pull out by the end of 2014, leaving the country to handle its own security. \"Too many big international companies are too afraid about what is going to happen after 2014,\"said Tom Watts, a director at SJH Group and former British paratrooper who served in Iraq. \"They\\'re sat on their backfoot waiting to see what happens... Let\\'s bring it on, all three concessions, let\\'s have them all.\" To reassure potential suitors, Mines Minister Wahidullah Shahrani announced the opening of the near billion dollar cement tender and also marked the publication of first official guide to investment in Afghanistan. \"This information will be sufficient to give first-hand information on whatever an investor requires to make the decision to come to Afghanistan,\" Shahrani said. Sharani said international experts had been called in to ensure the terms would be favorable to investors. Nodding to fears about corruption in a country that routinely ranks among the most corrupt in the world, the minister promised the tender would be conducted in a \"very transparent and clean manner\". Afghanistan\\'s unruly territory holds large deposits of gold, copper, iron ore and oil, as well as lithium and rare earths used in high-tech manufacturing. Chinese firms have scrambled to access its wealth but both of the country\\'s most important ventures are at a standstill. In Amu Darya, oil production has stopped because there is no deal in place to refine it. At Mes Aynak, the Chinese consortium has  demanded a review of a landmark $3 billion deal to produce copper in Afghanistan. Afghanistan imports virtually all of its cement at the cost of around $1 billion a year, making it the second largest drain on its cash after fuel. If the three cement plants tendered start up as hoped over the next few years, they could eventually supply all of the country\\'s needs, according to officials at the event. A second prospective investor, an Afghan doctor turned business manager, said he was also undeterred by the Chinese troubles. \"Cement is a very good investment, demand is high and there are a lot of new projects,\" said Dr Mohammad Shafiq, a senior manager for a group of companies including Griffin Ltd, based in Yemen.

Germany\\'s closely watched IFO business sentiment index is also expected to show a gain. Gross domestic product in the euro zone remains 3 percent below its 2008 peak and unemployment is at a record high, but the 17-member bloc is set to expand for the second quarter in a row after 18 months of contraction, according to Bert Colijn, an economist with the Conference Board in Brussels. Even the construction industry, which crashed when the financial crisis struck, appears to be bottoming out. \"The outlook continues to improve for Europe in general,\" Colijn said. \"The fact that we\\'re seeing a momentum change at the moment is a positive signal.\" Jim O\\'Neill, former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the PMIs of the entire Group of Seven advanced industrial countries were all rising quite significantly for the first time since 2008. An exceptionally strong reading last week for the Philadelphia Federal Reserve\\'s manufacturing survey also hinted that the global economy was stirring. \"It\\'s quite conceivable that declining commodity prices are giving a big lift to real incomes,\" O\\'Neill said. CONGRESS MUDDIES THE WATERS That\\'s the good news. The bad news is that the Fed, in deciding not to start scaling back its bond buying, has created new uncertainty by playing down the importance of the unemployment rate in isolation as a guide to its monetary policy. In June, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said he expected to start withdrawing stimulus this year and end asset purchases by mid-2014, when the jobless rate was likely to be near 7 percent. Last Wednesday, adopting a more discretionary stance, he emphasized that he had no fixed calendar in mind. <ID:L2N0HE1YZ> Although markets initially cheered the tapering reprieve, economists polled by Reuters said the Fed had failed to communicate its views clearly in advance. Because the Bank of England has also tied its policy to hitting a precise unemployment target, the U.S. central bank\\'s shift could have broader repercussions. \"The Fed\\'s move is a major blow for the credibility of forward guidance,\" O\\'Neill said. In standing pat, Bernanke said he needed more evidence of solid growth and fretted over a sharp tightening in financial conditions since he first flagged that tapering was on the way. Robert Wescott, president of Keybridge Research in Washington, put more weight on a third reason Bernanke gave - a fast-approaching showdown in Washington over the 2014 budget and an increase in the federal debt ceiling. \"I do think at the margin that was the factor that tipped them into not acting,\" Wescott told a conference organized by Oxford Analytica, a consultancy. If the Senate and House of Representatives fail to pass a funding bill, the government could shut down on October 1. Although most Congress-watchers doubt it will come to that, Democrats and Republicans are digging in, ensuring a nervous end to the month for markets that could deflect attention from revised GDP, durable goods and housing data. GERMANY AND EUROPE Another source of uncertainty is the shape of Germany\\'s new government after Sunday\\'s general election and what it will mean for Berlin\\'s policy towards the euro. Angela Merkel is expected to remain chancellor but she might need as long as two months to form a coalition. If Merkel\\'s Christian Democrats cannot continue to govern with the liberal Free Democrats but are forced into a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats, Germany may be more open to forging a banking union without an arduous treaty change, said Hartmut Mayer, a fellow in politics at Oxford University. Mechanisms to supervise, bail out and close down banks at the euro zone level are critical to putting the single currency on a firmer foundation. The Social Democrats would also be more open to the principle of euro zone debt mutualization as part of an ultimate solution to southern Europe\\'s debt overhang, Mayer said. \"It would be the same chancellor but a different constellation and I think that makes a difference, he said.

Authorities have said they want to consolidate the domestic milk powder sector to increase the ability of companies to compete with international rivals who dominate the lucrative premium end of China's $12.4 billion infant formula market. Officials at Yili, Mengniu and Feihe were not immediately available for comment. Chinese milk powder firms would gain the support in the form of government subsidies, funds from China Development Bank and favorable tax policies, the China Business Journal said. The total amount would be about 30 billion yuan, it said. Milk powder is a sensitive topic in China after a 2008 scandal involving milk tainted with melamine led to the deaths of at least six infants and made many thousands ill. That hit the reputation of domestic dairy firms and boosted the market share of imported brands such as Danone SA ( DANO.PA ), Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ), Mead Johnson Nutrition Co ( MJN.N ) and Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ). But international milk powder has recently come under the spotlight, with China temporarily banning some dairy products from New Zealand's Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd FCGHA.NZ, after a scare. Last month, the country's price regulator handed down record fines to mostly foreign milk powder makers. Last week, official Chinese television said French food group Danone SA had bribed doctors and nurses to recommend its Dumex milk powder brand at a hospital in northern China, and said the practice was widespread in the sector. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has previously released a plan to slash the number of domestic infant formula firms in the highly fragmented market over the next five years to 50 from about 200 now as it looks to create stronger sector leaders. According to data from market research firm Euromonitor, Yili and Wondersun were the two leading Chinese milk powder producers by retail value in 2012. Feihe and Mengniu were in the top ten.

Lloyds now plans to run the business on a standalone basis ahead of a listing in summer 2014, although TSB\\'s new boss Paul Pester said that could change. \"It\\'s absolutely possible that someone may come in and say this is a fantastic business we\\'ll make you an offer for it. That\\'s something we can leave Lloyds to deal with,\" Pester told reporters at the launch of the new business in central London. The return of the 200-year-old TSB brand to the high street after an 18-year absence is the result of action by regulators and the government to introduce greater competition in the country\\'s banking sector. Pester said TSB would focus on a local banking model, \"supporting economic growth in the communities it serves\". It will become Britain\\'s 8th biggest retail bank with 4.5 million customers and a 4.3 percent share of the current account market. However, Lloyds\\' Group Retail Director Allison Britton told Reuters TSB\\'s management would initially be granted only \"semi- independence\" from its parent. \"They can do quite a lot of things themselves but they still might have to ask me about many things. They can propose pricing changes for products but I have to approve them. The same would go with things like risk appetite,\" she said. An influential cross-party committee of lawmakers set up to review standards within the industry said in June that a lack of competition in UK retail banking was an important reason why poor standards of conduct persisted in the industry. Susan Kramer, a Liberal Democrat peer who sat on the committee, said there was still a lot to be done to break the dominance of Britain\\'s biggest four high street lenders - RBS ( RBS.L ), Lloyds, Barclays ( BARC.L ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) - which control around three-quarters of retail accounts. \"There\\'s a long way to go to get to the point where consumers have a real range of choices, where competition bites in such a way that it changes the behavior of the big players,\" she told Reuters. Lloyds\\' Britton said the bank was aiming for a stock market listing for the TSB business in the summer of 2014 and that the sale of the business would be done in stages. \"It will be quick. We set ourselves a number of goals - finishing this divestment, repaying the government, returning to dividends and profitability. The sooner we can do all of those things the better,\" she said. Britton said she anticipated investor appetite for the stock, despite a number of other bank share issues scheduled for the coming months including a rights issue by Barclays, the sale of the government\\'s stake in Lloyds itself, and a possible listing of 315 branches by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). \"It\\'s a nice balanced strongly-capitalized fully UK-orientated bank with a good distribution network. I think it\\'ll be a great stock but it all comes down to the market and the price on the day,\" she said.

      "{'text': ' Almost 13 years after pulling the plug on its last attempt to enter the Indian market, Singapore Airlines Ltd ( SIAL.SI ) is taking another stab at the country by again teaming up with the Tata Group as part of a broader strategic shift. \\n Last week, the two companies applied to set up a new New Delhi-based full-service carrier, pledging a combined $100 million to get it going. This follows an unsuccessful attempt to do the same in the mid-1990s and a failed attempt to buy state-owned Air India in 2000. The new carrier, if approved, will initially serve the 1.2 billion Indian market. Barring no political or regulatory obstacles, it could be airborne in about a year. SIA, which will have a 49 percent stake in the carrier, will be banking on its success. Intense competition on its mainline medium and long-haul markets from Gulf carriers like Emirates Airline and neighbors such as Garuda Indonesia ( GIAA.JK ) and Malaysian Airline ( MASM.KL ), and weak demand on services to Europe, means that SIA, Asia\\'s second-biggest airline with a market value of $10 billion, has changed course in recent years. Sources familiar with the airline\\'s strategy say that the management, led by low-profile chief executive Goh Choon Phong, is pushing ahead with a \"portfolio\" strategy that revolves around increasing the company\\'s exposure to the fast-growing Asia Pacific and the low-cost markets. By diversifying its revenue streams and creating new ones, like the Indian joint venture, Goh and his team plans to reduce SIA\\'s dependence on the flagship carrier over the medium term, say investors and analysts. \"They just have to address why their brand should still be at a premium. They still have a lot to do to actually get investors to be a bit more confident of their prospects,\" said Kristy Fong, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, which holds a stake of about 4 percent in SIA. CASH POWER Despite the near term pressure on profits, SIA\\'s cash pile of $4.5 billion - the biggest among Asian airlines - means that it has the ability to invest in existing and new airlines, the Centre for Aviation (CAPA) said in a report. It started Scoot, a long-haul low-cost airline, last year to tap the low-fare leisure markets that SIA left behind as it focused on the premium business. Its one-third stake in short-haul LCC Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd ( TAHL.SI ) could also potentially go up to 46.5 percent. SIA bought a stake in Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd ( VAH.AX ) in late 2012 and increased this to 19.9 percent, ensuring access to the important Australian market. Silkair, SIA\\'s fully-owned regional subsidiary, will retire its fleet of Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A320s and induct new Boeing ( BA.N ) 737s over the next few years as it grows its network of Asia-Pacific services. SIA itself has ordered dozens of new Airbus A350s, and Boeing\\'s 777-300ERs and 787-10s. The Indian venture has its challenges. SIA must successfully chart a course around India\\'s political and bureaucratic minefield for regulatory approval. Under existing regulations, it must serve the domestic market for five years before it can operate international flights. Taxes and airport fees are high, and profitability rare for the country\\'s airlines. SIA\\'s competitors in the full-service segment are beleaguered Air India, which survives only because of the hundreds of millions of dollars New Delhi has pumped into it, and Jet Airways ( JET.NS ), in which Etihad Airways is buying a minority stake.

Analysts were expecting an August trade gap of about $44.0 billion. Overall U.S. exports dropped 1.0 percent as troubles in Europe continue to weigh on global growth, while imports fell 0.1 percent in a sign of faltering U.S. demand for consumer products, autos and capital goods. Exports of oil, chemicals and other industrial supplies fell to the lowest level since February 2011, helping pull down the entire goods category, despite an increase in capital goods exports to the second-highest level on record. Services exports defied the overall trend and rose to a record $52.8 billion, due mostly to increases in professional and business services and transportation. Services imports also set a record, reflecting licensing fees to broadcast the Summer Olympic games in Britain. The average price for imported oil rose slightly in August to $94.36 per barrel, helping to push the monthly oil import bill higher. A separate Labor Department report showed that overall U.S. import prices rose 1.1 percent for the second consecutive month in September, while U.S. export prices rose 0.8 percent.

      "{'text': ' JPMorgan Chase and Co\\'s ( JPM.N ) chief financial officer, Doug Braunstein, may step down and take another position with the bank, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. \\n The move would be the latest management change at the bank, which has been roiled by $6 billion of losses from bad bets on derivatives. The person familiar with the matter said Wednesday that any shift would be Braunstein\\'s decision, and would be unrelated to the trades. In July, JPMorgan announced new co-heads for commercial and investment banking and placed a co-chief operating officer in the reporting line between Braunstein and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Dimon had testified a month earlier to a U.S. Senate committee that Braunstein was one of the people who had wrongly assured him in April that the derivatives losses were not a big deal. Analysts believed the executive changes in July were designed to add checks and balances to the bank\\'s senior ranks after the trading losses, which have brought intense regulatory scrutiny to the bank. Dimon told Reuters at the time that the shifts had been in the works before the bad trades, and were designed to help the bank cope with the increased complexity that financial companies face globally. Braunstein did not return a call to his cell phone seeking comment on his possible job change, and the bank declined to comment. The timing for any job change for Braunstein is unclear. The bank is set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday. The $6 billion of trading losses came from a JPMorgan group called the Chief Investment Office (CIO), which managed risk for the bank and invested deposits. The CIO group in London took large bets on derivatives, with one trader taking big enough positions to be called \"the London Whale.\" The bank first disclosed possible losses in May, and in July said that some traders may have lied about the value of their positions to the bank, adding fuel to government probes into the trades. Regulators and agencies including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are all looking at the bank. On Wednesday, Dimon told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, \"We made a stupid error. He added: \"I should have caught it ... I didn\\'t.\" Even with the trading losses, JPMorgan Chase earned $5 billion in the second quarter. In narrative accounts of the bad trades by multiple media outlets, including a more-than-7,000 word piece published in this weekend\\'s New York Times Magazine, Braunstein is not mentioned. JPMorgan said last week in an internal memo that Barry Zubrow was retiring. Zubrow was head of risk management at the bank when it was building a dangerously large position in credit derivatives. In January, months before the bank announced the bad derivatives trades, Zubrow switched to heading corporate and regulatory affairs. News of Braunstein\\'s possible job switch was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. (Additional reporting by Sarah N.

It\\'s a very large change and a low level but I suspect some kind of special factor was involved. One suggestion was that most of the decline came from one state, which suggests a problem with data collection was involved. \"The trade numbers showed a little bit of widening in the trade deficit.

It was probably partly erratic and assisted by seasonal adjustments, given the fall we have had in the unemployment rate. It does seem like there is something going on maybe in the labor market. The Labor Department said most of the fall came in one state. The numbers are probably exaggerating the scale of the labor market improvement, but it does seem that there is something going on. \"Import prices were a little higher than expected and last month was upwardly revised.

      "{'text': ' French retailer Carrefour SA ( CARR.PA ) said its home market was showing signs of improvement, reassuring investors that an action plan being implemented by new Chief Executive Georges Plassat is starting to bear fruit. \\n Plassat joined Carrefour in May with a brief to reverse years of underperformance in Carrefour\\'s main European markets, where the hypermarkets in which it had heavily invested have been hit by competition from specialist stores and trends toward local and online shopping. Shares in the world\\'s second-largest retailer after U.S. group Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) were up 4.4 percent at 16.70 euros by 0858 GMT, the top riser on the CAC 40 index of French blue-chip stocks  .FCHI . \"After a positive surprise in the first half and another ... in the third quarter, confidence could quietly return in the new management\\'s ability to put things back on track,\" analysts at brokerage Aurel BGC said in a note. Plassat, who has a record of company restructuring and whose reputation as a cost-cutter earned him the nickname of \"Le Nettoyeur\" (cleaner), took over from retiring Lars Olofsson and is trying to around the company\\'s fortunes. He said in August he would slash costs and defend key markets like France, Brazil and China, but has so far provided little detail on his turnaround plan. Carrefour\\'s third-quarter statement showed sales up 0.2 percent on a like-for-like basis at 22.63 billion euros ($29.2 billion), above an average forecast of 22.57 billion in a Reuters poll of seven banks and brokerages, as robust demand in Latin America made up for weakness in austerity-hit Spain and Italy. Revenue in France stripping out fuel declined 1.5 percent, an improvement from a 3.3 percent drop in the second quarter and indicating initiatives such as offering cash-strapped shoppers lasting price cuts, introduced last year and strengthened by Plassat, are starting to have an impact. France accounts for more than 40 percent of group sales. ENCOURAGING SIGNS \"While we are pleased with these encouraging signs, we are still hard at work in France,\" Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon told a conference call. The group said it was comfortable with analyst estimates for 2012 earnings of between 2.07 and 2.10 billion euros, before interest and taxes (EBIT), against 2.18 billion last year. Sales at Carrefour\\'s French hypermarkets fell 3.3 percent in the third quarter, against a 5.7 percent fall in the second quarter. Sales in the food sector improved for a third consecutive quarter. Sivignon told analysts the sales trend for non-food items such as textiles and electronics had also marginally improved but remained difficult in French hypermarkets. He said \"price image\", a closely watched perception shoppers have of how expensive Carrefour is compared with rivals, was also gradually improving. \"It\\'s a long-term effort but the trend is there,\" he said. Many retailers across Europe are struggling as consumers\\' disposable incomes have been squeezed by rising prices, muted wage growth and government austerity measures, as well as changing consumer habits. Last week Metro AG ( MEOG.DE ), the world\\'s fourth-largest retailer, cut its earnings outlook for 2012, blaming rising unemployment in the euro zone and the sovereign debt crisis, while Britain\\'s biggest retailer Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) recently reported a 12.4 percent drop in UK trading profit. Carrefour still has big operations in some of the countries worst hit by the crisis, such as Spain and Italy, having pulled out of Greece. Spain and Italy accounted for more than 16 percent of group sales in the third quarter. Quarterly like-for-like sales excluding petrol fell 5.4 percent in Spain and 6.6 percent in Italy. The trend for non-food sales in Spain was slightly better, but Sivignon cautioned that a new batch of austerity measures there could have an impact on fourth-quarter consumption. In emerging markets, China continued to struggle, while Brazil, Carrefour\\'s second-largest market after France, had like-for-like sales growth of 9.7 percent.

Coal miner Peabody Energy ( BTU.N ) rose 8.9 percent to $26.18 and its peer Consol Energy ( CNX.N ) added 8 percent to $35.48 on bets higher natural gas prices would encourage coal use by power producers. Sprint shares jumped 14.3 percent to $5.76 on news of the possible acquisition by Japan\\'s Softbank, while AT&T lost 1.8 percent to $36.26 and Verizon dropped 1.3 percent to $45.20. Clearwire Corp CLWR.O, in which Sprint holds a majority interest, surged 70.8 percent to $2.22. Truck manufacturer Oshkosh ( OSK.N ) rallied 11.4 percent to $29.90 on news that investor Carl Icahn had offered to buy all of its shares for $32.50 each.

European officials said on Monday divergences had emerged inside the euro zone and with the IMF over how best to proceed, especially on whether Athens should obtain some respite in its deficit-cutting efforts. Spain is also under pressure as the IMF, the Bank of Spain and many economists have said that the economic forecast the government used to build its budget plan for 2013 was too optimistic, putting the country at risk of missing its deficit targets. The IMF forecast Spain\\'s economy would shrink 1.3 percent next year, which compares with a forecast for a 0.5 percent contraction used in next year\\'s budget. Spain\\'s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos on Monday said Madrid would stick to its targets and was not planning any further cuts. The euro zone has already eased fiscal targets for Spain once this year. On Monday, the euro zone gave Portugal one more year, until 2014, to get its budget deficit below the European Union ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product.

      "{'text': ' The United States on Wednesday slapped steep final duties on billions of dollars of solar energy products from China, but turned down a request from lawmakers and U.S. manufacturers to expand the scope of its order. \\n China\\'s government and its solar manufacturers criticized the decision, adding more heat to the U.S.-China trade relationship following a congressional panel report on Monday urging American companies not to do business with two Chinese telecommunications companies because of security concerns. \"The United States is provoking trade friction in the new energy sector, and sending a negative signal to the world that stirs global trade protectionism and obstructs the sector\\'s development,\" said China\\'s Commerce Ministry spokesman Shen Danyang. Shen called on Washington to \"correct its mistaken ways\" and warned that the duties would harm U.S. exporters and customers. The U.S. Commerce Department said Chinese companies were \"dumping\" solar cells and panels in the United States at prices 18.32 percent to 249.96 percent below fair value, although some individual companies received lower anti-dumping duty rates than in a preliminary decision earlier this year. The department also set additional countervailing duties ranging from 14.78 to 15.97 percent to combat Chinese government subsidies, significantly higher than preliminary levels. The United States imported about $3.1 billion worth of solar cells and panels from China in 2011, although that figure contains some products not covered by the investigation. In a related decision that disappointed U.S. producers and cheered U.S. companies that install solar panels, the department turned down pleas to expand the scope of its order to include Chinese panels (or modules) made with non-Chinese solar cells. Timothy Brightbill, outside attorney for SolarWorld Industries Americas, the driving force behind the U.S. case, said the company would continue to aggressively pursue that issue in the hopes of a more favorable ruling. \"In our view, all Chinese cells and all Chinese modules are dumped and subsidized,\" Brightbill said SolarWorld is worried the department\\'s current stance on the issue will encourage Chinese solar panel producers to move cell production to nearby countries to avoid U.S. duties, he said. But Jigar Shah, president of the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy, which includes Chinese and U.S. companies that oppose SolarWorld\\'s case, said including panels with non-Chinese cells in the order would have \"created a lot more chaos.\" The Commerce Department\\'s decision not to expand the scope is a \"silver lining\" to an otherwise disappointing decision on duties, Shah said. MASSIVE OVERSUPPLY The United States also has slapped preliminary duties on wind turbine towers from China and is expected to launch a new probe next week into charges that imports of Chinese hardwood plywood are unfairly priced and subsidized. \"We have the most squabbles with our biggest trading partners,\" said Scott Miller, a trade policy specialist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explaining the steady stream of U.S.-China trade spats. In the solar sector, producers in the United States and Europe complain China\\'s rapid expansion of solar panel manufacturing has created massive oversupply, erasing profits and sending company share prices into a tailspin. SolarWorld\\'s German parent has also been behind a charge in Europe for duties on Chinese solar panel imports. China has already struck back by launching an investigation into imports of solar-grade polysilicon from both the United States and South Korea. Chinese manufacturer Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd on Wednesday was hit with a final anti-dumping duty of 31.73 percent and a countervailing duty of 14.78 percent. However, combined duty rates for Suntech and other companies will be reduced by about 10.54 percentage points to avoid \"double-counting\" of Chinese export subsidies in the anti-dumping and countervailing duty rates. Trina Solar Ltd received a final 18.32 percent anti-dumping duty and a 15.97 percent countervailing duty. Well over a hundred companies were hit with a 25.96 percent anti-dumping duty and a 15.24 percent countervailing duty. Trina said in a statement that it was waiting for a decision from the U.S. International Trade Commission, a separate U.S. government agency, which must give its approval for the duties to take force, before deciding whether to appeal. The ITC vote is expected in early November. Importers have been, however, required to post bonds or cash deposits based on the preliminary rates. The Commerce Department also set a China-wide anti-dumping rate of 249.96 percent for other Chinese producers and exporters. The Obama administration has heavily backed solar and other renewable energy since taking office, pledging about $16 billion for 26 projects through its clean energy loan program. Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney has criticized the support, saying the federal government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers.

      "{'text': ' Bentley and Lamborghini\\'s plans to develop ultra-luxury SUVs may be put on hold to save cash for parent Volkswagen, company sources said, in a sign that the crisis is beginning to bite even for the German auto giant. \\n U.K.-based Bentley and the Italian supercar maker rolled out extravagant concept sport utility vehicles (SUV) at the auto shows in Geneva and Beijing this year, with production awaiting approval by VW\\'s management board. The push towards off-roaders is aimed at boosting profitability at Lamborghini, loss-making since 2009, and Bentley. The move has dismayed Lamborghini purists who fear that expanding to four-by-fours will dilute the brand\\'s exclusivity. Grappling with unforeseen production cuts and slowing auto sales, VW may postpone the models as it reviews planned spending on equipment, factories and vehicles due to be ratified by VW\\'s supervisory board on November 23, two company sources said. \"Such vehicles are anything but obligatory during a crisis,\" said Frankfurt-based Equinet AG analyst Tim Schuldt. \"Delaying their launch would be no drama but help save costs.\" VW, on course to overtake U.S. rival General Motors as the world\\'s second-biggest carmaker behind Toyota Motor Corp, has outperformed the European market this year. The German company\\'s eight-month EU-wide sales were flat at 2.05 million cars, compared with a 7.1 percent drop to 8.27 million vehicles for the 27-nation region\\'s market. The Wolfsburg-based maker of the Golf hatchback said on Tuesday that sales at its flagship passenger car brand rose just 4.3 percent to 492,500 vehicles in September, the smallest gain in eight months. VW halted production in Germany of its Passat model for two days last week as part of a wider move to cut group output by about 300,000 vehicles to 9.4 million cars this year. That would be up on last year\\'s output of 8.5 million but short of the goal originally set for 2012 of about 9.7 million, company sources said on October 5. Finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch signaled at the Paris auto show that the slump in European demand could spark further austerity measures at VW. \"In this environment, we need to have a considerable amount of liquidity available,\" Poetsch said on September 26. \"It\\'s normal that one looks for items that aren\\'t imperative,\" he added, referring to investments that could potentially be pushed back. Bentley and Lamborghini would be up against stiff new competition with their plush SUVs; Fiat\\'s Maserati will start production next year of the Jeep-based Kubang, while UK-based Land Rover will launch the new Range Rover Sport in 2014. Ferrari has had a family car, the FF, its biggest model, in its range since last year. The two VW divisions aim to replicate Porsche\\'s success with the Cayenne SUV, which now accounts for half the sports-car maker\\'s deliveries. But exorbitant pricing, fierce competition and a limited pool of buyers in markets such as China may restrain their sales, according to research firm IHS Automotive. His said production of the Bentley SUV, scheduled to start in late 2014, might peak at fewer than 4,000 cars in 2016, while the Lamborghini Urus could reach a maximum of fewer than 2,400 in 2018, a year after the model started rolling off the line. \"It\\'ll be tough to turn the models into sustainable business cases,\" Frankfurt-based IHS analyst Henner Lehne said. Bentley could not confirm that its first-ever SUV, code-named EXP 9-F, would be delayed. It will continue to push for the model to get the nod from VW\\'s leadership, spokeswoman Kerstin Sachl said on Wednesday, adding the British carmaker was hoping for a decision by the end of the year. Lamborghini chief executive Stephan Winkelmann told Reuters on September 27 that while VW has yet to sign off on the Urus, the Italian manufacturer would continue with the model\\'s development.

      "{'text': ' The directors of troubled Bumi Plc ( BUMIP.L ), one of the world\\'s largest thermal coal exporters, gathered for a board meeting on Thursday amid an uncertain future for the company created by British-born financier Nat Rothschild and Indonesia\\'s Bakrie family. \\n Allegations of financial irregularities, against a background of weak coal prices and tumbling shares, have strained already frayed relations between major investors in the London venture and fuelled speculation of a potential split. The meeting was being held in Singapore and Rothschild, 41-year-old scion of the Rothschild banking dynasty, was in the city, sources close to the company said. They said the board members had dinner together on Wednesday night. The board includes Rothschild, Indra Bakrie, one of the Bakrie brothers, and Samin Tan, an Indonesian billionaire who pulled the Bakries back from default last year with a $1 billion investment, only to watch the value of his shares crumble. The Bakries and Tan each hold half of a 47.6 percent stake in Bumi Plc, while Rothschild owns 12 percent. The relationship between Rothschild and the Bakries, one of Indonesia\\'s most powerful and politically connected families, has soured over the past year, particularly after a leaked letter from the financier last November that called for a \"radical clean-up\". The letter was seen as a sign of his frustration with the Bakrie family, whose patriarch Aburizal Bakrie is an Indonesian presidential candidate. Tan and the Bakries pushed out Rothschild as co-chairman in March and Tan became chairman. But relations have also frayed between the Bakries and Tan. Sources have said Tan is \"furious\" with the Bakries after watching the value of his investment plunge -- the shares he bought are worth only one-ninth the level at which he came in. The board meeting is the first since an inquiry into potential wrongdoing at the group\\'s Indonesian operations was announced last month. The independent probe, being led by a London law firm and still in progress, has revived worries over governance at Bumi Plc and concerns over the woes of its debt-burdened affiliate, PT Bumi Resources ( BUMI.JK ), the jewel in the Bakrie empire. Heightening tensions before the Singapore meeting, the Bakries said on Wednesday that telephones and e-mail accounts belonging to the family and its group of companies had been hacked, pointing to unspecified \"suspicions\" over whom to blame. The incident has been reported to Indonesian police. WRITTEN DOWN Most of the allegations of financial irregularity, expected to total more than $500 million, relate to Bumi Resources, the flagship Bakrie miner and Indonesia\\'s largest coal producer. Two of three investments at the center of the probe, though, have already been written down to zero by the London parent. \"While we are not able to quantify the amounts involved in these irregularities, we believe this investigation may reinforce the idea that the company needs to address its complex corporate structure,\" analysts at JP Morgan, the bank that fostered the creation of Bumi, said in a note last month. Bumi was listed in London last year via a reverse takeover engineered by Rothschild that aimed to create an international coal-mining powerhouse with operations in Indonesian Borneo, and one of the biggest listed companies on the London exchange. The deal highlighted the promise of Indonesia, Southeast Asia\\'s biggest economy, which boasts some of the world\\'s largest deposits of coal, gold, copper, tin and natural gas, spread across an archipelago of 17,000 islands. But banks and dealmakers looking for long-term investments in Indonesia must tread carefully around the powerful local conglomerate heads. The Borneo coal mines at the heart of the deal once belonged to global energy companies Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ), BP ( BP.L ) and BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ), which sold them to the Bakries in 2001 and 2003, after facing pressure from nationalists to divest their assets to local interests. Sources familiar with the matter said Thursday\\'s board meeting was a scheduled gathering, with a long-planned to-do list - but top of the agenda will be progress made by lawyers on their probe, which could run into next month. The meeting of the board members, 16 after the resignation of former CEO Ari Hudaya, is expected to include Chairman Samin Tan, co-Chairman Indra Bakrie and Rothschild, and is therefore unlikely to escape discussion on the future of the group. At least one of the sources, though, said no restructuring could be decided before the full investigation was completed. Bumi Plc has long said it would like to bring together Bumi Resources, in which it owns 29 percent, and coal miner Berau, in which it owns 85 percent, into a single operating holding. But options being considered by teams of advisers courting Bumi in recent weeks include more radical solutions, such as a divorce of Bumi Resources from the group. Bumi Plc\\'s board could also seek to replace Hudaya, who was chief executive until March and is still chief executive of Bumi Resources. Two sources also said they could not exclude other changes.

But Britain\\'s earnings in August - including Olympic and Paralympic tickets bought before and during the Games - rose 9 percent on the year. \"The average amount of money spent by those people who either made their visit for an Olympics or Paralympics purpose or attended a ticketed event was almost twice as much as the average spent among other visitors,\" the ONS said. Based on its surveys, the ONS estimates that some 590,000 visitors came to Britain during July and August either for the Games or at least attended one ticketed event. The noticeable lack of visitors in London\\'s theatres, museums and on buses and trains during the Olympics have raised concerns that the Games could hurt British businesses as other tourists stayed away to avoid the crowds. IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer pointed out that the weak economic situation in many countries across the globe might have also been a reason for the fall in tourist numbers. \"While the impact of the Olympic Games and the Paralympics on the number of overseas visitors coming to the UK in August may be open to differing interpretations, it is evident that the Games did boost spending by overseas visitors to the UK,\" he said. The British economy is widely expected to have posted some growth in the July-September period as production bounced back from a hit caused by the extra public holiday in June. Economists in a Reuters poll expect growth of 0.6 pct in the quarter, which would mean an end to the recession after three consecutive quarters of contraction. The ONS has already said that all ticket revenues from the July 27-August 12 Olympics and the August 29-September 9 Paralympics will be accounted for in the third quarter, boosting quarterly GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points.

      "{'text': ' The U.S. housing market is starting to thaw, but it could be two years before a full-blown recovery takes hold, Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) Chief Executive Frank Blake said on Thursday. \\n The world\\'s largest home improvement retailer has seen the benefits of the nascent U.S. housing recovery as professional contractors have started buying more in recent months. \"It\\'s starting to recover, but we\\'re a long way away from true recovery,\" Blake, 63, told Reuters in a wide-ranging interview that touched on his views of the so-called Fiscal Cliff to why he sees the internet as Home Depot\\'s next frontier. The comments came less than a week after two influential Federal Reserve officials blamed the disappointing rebound in U.S. housing for continuing to trip up the country\\'s overall economic recovery. \"This housing market\\'s been very, very bad and it\\'s going to take some time to recover,\" Blake said. A bubble in the U.S. housing market was at the core of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which started the same year that Blake became CEO. During the housing downturn, Home Depot\\'s sales at established stores fell more than 20 percent in markets such as Florida and California. \"The way we look at it is there\\'s going to be a period of a workout, a fine period of one to two years and then you\\'re going to get a more robust recovery,\" Blake said. Credit availability and the overhang of distressed housing are among the reasons the housing market can\\'t \"just spring back\" to where it was before the recession, Blake said. While California and Florida, states slammed by the housing downturn, show signs of improvement, Blake urged investors not to read too much into the recent signs of recovery. \"We\\'ve had head fakes on the housing market coming back, so you always worry that this is a little bit of a head fake,\" Blake said. One way to tell the difference is whether or not consumers will again look at a home improvement as a cost they can recoup when they sell their home. \"The fundamental question asked in our business is does our customer think about a granite countertop as an expense or an investment?\" he said. TAKING THE ONLINE ROUTE As it looks for new areas of growth, Home Depot plans to concentrate on building its Internet business rather than overseas expansion, Blake said. Last month, Blake decided to close all seven of Home Depot\\'s big box stores in China after a failed expansion attempt there. He said he views online business as the next area of expansion, rather than new geographic markets. \"Home Depot can afford not to be in Brazil. Home Depot can afford not to be in, name your country. Home Depot cannot afford not to be the best, what we call, inter-connected retailer in our space,\" said Blake. The retailer, which bought California-based Red Beacon earlier this year, is interested in making more acquisitions in Silicon Valley to boost its online business and other related capabilities, Blake said. Even in China, the retailer has already started selling goods on website 360buy.com and is looking for opportunities to partner with other e-commerce sites. FISCAL CLIFF Blake said he had not yet seen U.S. shoppers holding back from spending because of fears of the looming \"fiscal cliff.\" That is Washington\\'s self-imposed year-end deadline to agree on a plan to shrink the federal budget or trigger $600 billion in spending cuts and higher taxes. \"We don\\'t see that in consumer behavior,\" Blake said. He was less confident when asked if he thought Washington will find its way through the crisis. \"You never want to get too deep into a bet on the rationality of Washington,\" Blake replied.

      "{'text': ' Greece\\'s jobless rate topped 25 percent and its biggest company said it would quit the country on Thursday in a fresh blow to an economy that German experts warned cannot be \"saved\" without writing off more debt. \\n The announcement by drinks bottler Coca Cola Hellenic (CCH) HLBr.AT that it was switching its primary listing from Athens to London, and moving its corporate base to stable, low-tax Switzerland, is a bitter blow to the debt-crippled nation. The firm, which bottles Coke and other drinks in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria, is Greece\\'s biggest by market value and is 23 percent owned by The Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) of the United States. It said its Greek plants would be unaffected. CCH\\'s announcement coincided with data that showed Greek unemployment climbing for a 35th consecutive month in July to 25.1 percent from a revised 24.8 percent in June. The jobless rate has more than tripled since the country\\'s now five-year-old recession began. Fifty-four percent of Greeks aged 15-24 years are out of work, fuelling violent protests against the tax hikes, spending cuts and public sector job losses demanded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund in exchange for more than 200 billion euros ($258.03 billion) in loans since 2010. Greece is still far off target. IMF chief Christine Lagarde, speaking in Tokyo, backed calls to give the country two more years, up to 2016, to cut its debt mountain to 120 percent of GDP from 165 percent in 2011. The IMF is also pressing official lenders such as euro zone paymaster Germany to take a \"haircut\" on their Greek debt similar to that swallowed by private bondholders this year. With elections in 2013, Berlin is resisting, but Germany\\'s leading economic institutes warned on Thursday that without further debt restructuring, the Greek economy would not make it. \"Yes, we don\\'t think Greece can be saved,\" Joachim Scheide, head of forecasting at the Kiel-based IfW institute, said when asked whether investors in Greek debt would have to accept another haircut. \"We need a restructuring of Greek debt; that would help Greece best,\" he said. MORE AUSTERITY German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was greeted with angry protests on Tuesday on her first visit to Greece since the debt crisis erupted, opposes any further restructuring, at least until after Germans vote next September. Her visit came as the Greek government is locked in talks with its \"troika\" of international lenders on more austerity measures to secure a next tranche of loans worth 31.5 billion euros. Without further aid, Athens says it will run out of money by the end of next month. Data released by the finance ministry showed Greece had narrowed its central government budget deficit by 37 percent in the first nine months of the year. But the figures did not include spending on local municipalities and social security - the areas of most concern for the troika, which comprises the IMF, the European Union\\'s executive Commission and the European Central Bank. Even after steep tax hikes, net government revenue stagnated at 36.7 billion euros, or 1.3 billion euros short of an interim target set under the bailout plan. Private businesses say the tax hikes are suffocating them. Coca Cola Hellenic had complained about the high tax measures, and on Thursday said it was relocating. Its Greek operations, which account for five percent of its bottling business, will be unaffected, but the move was bad news for a nation struggling to compete inside the euro zone. Chief executive Dimitris Lois said the decision to switch the company\\'s primary listing to London and its corporate base to Switzerland made \"clear business sense\". Its move follows Greek dairy group FAGE\\'s relocation to Luxembourg this month. \"This is a healthy company that does not want to suffer from Greece\\'s high country risk,\" said an analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Analyst Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities in Athens said that the move made sense for the firm, which follows Greek dairy group FAGE this month in seeking a low-tax, low-volatility haven for its corporate base - in FAGE\\'s case Luxembourg. \"The Greek bourse is losing a very good company and the London Stock Exchange is gaining a very important group,\" said Hatzidakis. \"It\\'s very bad news for the Greek economy and bourse.\" COUNTRY RISK Another analyst said the firm, which rose to the top of corporate rankings as the values of Greek banks collapsed, was out to rid its share price of risks associated with Greece; the country is mired in recession and facing mass discontent as its leaders slash budgets to meet international creditors\\' terms for loans intended to keep Athens inside Europe\\'s single currency. \"This is a healthy company that does not want to suffer from Greece\\'s high country risk,\" said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign investors have been steadily reducing their investment in the Athens Stock Exchange  .ATG  since the country was engulfed by the sovereign debt crisis in 2009. Greece\\'s future in the 17-nation euro zone still remains in doubt. Aided by the fact that it is doing most of its business outside Greece, CCH consistently outperformed the general Athens stock market index, which has slumped to 20-year lows. CCH has become the country\\'s biggest firm by market value with a capitalization of around 6 billion euros ($7.7 billion), representing about a fifth of the Athens bourse\\'s total. Typical daily trading in its shares has represented close to 10 percent of average volume on a Greek stock market where trade had already halved over the past year, squeezing broking firms. The company, which last year made net profit of 330 million euros on sales of 6.85 billion, has also complained of high taxes imposed under Greek government austerity measures. CCH said it would delist from the Athens Stock Exchange and then seek to re-enter that bourse with a secondary listing. Coca Cola Hellenic shares were down 5.8 percent at 15.49 euros in Athens after the news. Analysts explained the drop by the low cash price of 13.58 euros the company is offering to those shareholders who refuse the offer of new Swiss shares.

      "{'text': ' Tom Enders was flying high six weeks ago; newly elevated to the top job at Europe\\'s EADS, his secret merger deal to create the world\\'s biggest aerospace group and rid himself of burdensome government meddling was preparing for launch. \\n But when \"Major Tom\", a pugnacious paratroop officer in the German army reserve, took off to go hang-gliding in late August, things began to go wrong. A painful crash that left his arms strapped up, robot-style, kept him only briefly from work; but it prevented him flying with Chancellor Angela Merkel on a trip to China where he might have hoped to win her as an ally. In the end, it seems unlikely even the most persuasive of her countrymen would have stopped Merkel shooting down the plan to merge with British defense contractor BAE Systems, which the firms pulled on Wednesday after governments failed to agree. But the tale of Enders\\' untimely fall to earth will stand as an image of how his daring bid to break the Airbus manufacturer free of political interference was brought down by exactly the kind of diplomatic turbulence he had hoped to put behind him. Within a couple of weeks of his accident, word of the $45-billion merger talks leaked, triggering a regulatory deadline in Britain to wrap up a deal by Wednesday; an ill-tempered free-for-all broke out among ministers in Paris, Berlin and London as well as corporate and institutional shareholders, many of them suspicious that Enders had been keeping them in the dark. Yet although the 53-year-old launched the idea with BAE Chief Executive Ian King in total secrecy in May, shortly before succeeding Frenchman Louis Gallois as CEO of European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. on June 1, the straight-talking Enders had never hidden his disdain for a corporate structure designed to protect national interests after a messy marriage 12 years ago. A particularly vocal public row a couple of years ago when Enders demanded more government backing up front for EADS\\' new military transport aircraft, the A400M, had won him few friends in politics, not least among his fellow Germans. And he kept on the offensive over the past year about those state holdings. These clipped EADS\\' wings, he argued, when it needed to fly free to compete, notably with American arch-rival Boeing. Addressing investors\\' doubts, he acknowledged during a presentation in London: \"This will not go down in history as the deal with the most cost synergies.\" Rather, as he wrote to employees of the group whose painful creation he witnessed at first hand in 2000, the merger would liberate EADS from constraints built into it at birth: \"If we succeed and if the EADS shareholder pact can be dissolved, our governance will be significantly simplified and \\'normalized\\'.\" POLITICAL CROSSWINDS In the end, some will see an irony in that it was this very web of interlinked and competing European interests that brought down his plan, codenamed Hawthorn, to bring together Elm - as in E for EADS - and Birch - BAE - its partner in the Eurofighter jet and a big supplier of military hardware to the Pentagon. Though there was also skepticism among private shareholders, who questioned the benefits of the complementing airliners with weaponry in the combined group, it was crosswinds from political leaders that downed the talks before any merger deal was ready. French and British officials said their differences, once seen as the toughest to overcome, had been settled; London had accepted a continued French state shareholding and Paris agreed to limits it had sought to avoid. They both pointed to Berlin, where Merkel and her ministers kept stony silence, as the principal naysayer when time ran out for talks on Wednesday. \"It\\'s a German government decision,\" one French official said. \"It\\'s a great shame, because ... we had made progress. \"It would seem that the chancellor does not want the discussions to continue.\" In London, a source said: \"It was absolutely heading in the right direction ... There was very significant progress with France. There wasn\\'t the same progress elsewhere.\" The German government, which unlike France is not directly a shareholder had, sources said, been offered parity with Paris in any combined group - something it wanted since carmaker Daimler has been looking to give up the biggest German stake in EADS. While others felt Berlin was offered good terms, including a stake in the firm and guarantees of jobs and office locations going to Germany, sources in the German government said a range of factors had soured Merkel on Enders\\' proposals. Those ranged from questions over the business logic and fears of damaging sales by possibly increasing state involvement to discomfort with involving Germany, still scarred by its militarist past, in what would become the world\\'s biggest armaments manufacturer. As once source close to Merkel said: \"Defense is an especially sensitive subject in Germany.\" A London hedge fund manager, who profited from the collapse of a plan that had depressed EADS shares and boosted BAE\\'s, reckoned Enders had been fighting a losing battle from the first: \"It proves that you can try to take the politics out of EADS,\" he said. \"But you can never take EADS out of politics.\" SECRET TALKS There were those who felt the managements\\' miscalculation had been in the very secrecy they hoped to maintain until a deal could be worked out away from the glare of public politicking. A source close to the Spanish government, which also has a stake in EADS, told Reuters: \"The fact that they tried to handle this deal behind the backs of the governments, who are the main shareholders, was a major error.\" Enders\\' position may now be questioned and EADS\\'s ownership structure may in any case face a major shake-up as Daimler and French conglomerate Lagardere try to sell out, disrupting a complex and partly secret set of internal pacts. The CEO, who has relished publicity stunts like jumping out of his own firm\\'s new military transporter from 12,000 feet, may now look back on where things went sour in talks that one source involved described as starting as \"a bit of banter\" between Enders and King. Within weeks of taking over the top job, that vague idea turned into a serious project in early July during a meeting at London\\'s City Airport among a small group from both firms. Later that month, wider discussions including lawyers and bankers sketched out a plan that would fix the share of EADS investors in the combined group at 60 percent and BAE at 40. Over the summer, government officials were getting involved - though not quickly enough for the liking of some ministers. And the corporate teams were caught off guard when, on September 12, just two weeks after the hang-gliding accident had disrupted Enders\\' plan for an Airbus-centered trip to China with Merkel, the news of the talks leaked and Britain\\'s takeover regulator set a 30-day clock ticking for them to make shareholders an offer - or show justification for extending the timetable. In the end, it was clear that, for now at least, it was a deal that wouldn\\'t fly.

      "{'text': ' The IMF on Thursday backed giving debt-burdened Greece and Spain more time to reduce their budget deficits, cautioning that cutting too far, too fast would do more harm than good. \\n But Germany pushed back and said back-tracking on debt-reduction goals would only hurt confidence, a stance that suggested some disagreement between the International Monetary Fund and Europe\\'s largest creditor country. \"The IMF has time and again said that high public debt poses a problem,\" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters. \"So when there is a certain medium-term goal, it doesn\\'t build confidence when one starts by going in a different direction.\" \"When you want to climb a big mountain and you start climbing down then the mountain will get even higher.\" The IMF released new research this week showing that fiscal consolidation has a much sharper negative effect on growth than previously thought. Since the global financial crisis, these so-called fiscal multipliers have been as much as three times larger than they were before 2009, the IMF research shows. That means aggressive austerity measures may inflict deep economic wounds that make it harder for an economy to get out from under heavy debt burdens. \"It is sometimes better to have a bit more time,\" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said. \"That is what we advocated for Portugal; this is what we advocated for Spain; and this is what we are advocating for Greece.\" But the IMF was less willing to be patient with Europe on following through with its efforts to seek a more cohesive fiscal and banking union. It said that process was critically incomplete, and blamed the plodding pace for contributing to economic uncertainty that was hurting global growth. Emerging markets expressed frustration that the euro zone troubles were spilling into their economies. The IMF still expects emerging markets to grow four times as fast as advanced economies, but it cut its forecast sharply for two of the biggest players, Brazil and India. \"Europe has to get its act together,\" said Palaniappan Chidambaram, India\\'s finance minister, speaking on behalf of the Group of 24 developing and emerging economies. \"What is happening in Europe is having an impact on developing countries.\" CREDITOR COUNTRIES The IMF has expressed frustration with Europe\\'s piecemeal response to its debt crisis and warned that a recent respite in borrowing costs for debt-laden countries such as Spain may prove short-lived unless euro zone leaders come up with a comprehensive and credible plan. In its financial stability report on Wednesday, the IMF said that without swift policy action, including the triggering of the European Central Bank\\'s bond-buying program, the premium that investors demand to hold Spanish and Italian debt instead of safer German bonds would nearly double. Standard & Poor\\'s cut its rating on Spain on Wednesday to a level just above junk territory, and Moody\\'s may soon follow. The IMF has said it stands ready to support a European bailout for Spain, should Madrid ask. Reuters reported on October 1 that Spain was ready to seek help, but that Germany was blocking an aid request because it preferred to combine a Spanish rescue with additional assistance for other struggling countries such as Greece. Jose Vinals, the head of the IMF\\'s monetary and capital markets department, warned that countries must not withhold help if Spain were to ask the European Central Bank to buy its bonds under a new bailout program, known as OMT for Outright Monetary Transaction. \"If it were to be the case that they decide to activate this mechanism and they can submit to the proper degree of conditionality, it would be essential that the creditor countries do not negate this activation of the OMT for Spain or for any of the countries,\" Vinals told Reuters. MIND THE FISCAL CLIFF European officials were keen to ensure their region was not the sole topic of discussion in Tokyo, where finance officials from around the globe have gathered for the semiannual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. Europe wants more attention placed on the difficulties Washington faces addressing its \"fiscal cliff\" of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect early next year unless the U.S. Congress acts. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the United States had a window of opportunity after its November 6 presidential election to negotiate a debt reform framework. Geithner said the magnitude of fiscal reforms that the United States needed to achieve debt sustainability was between 2 percent and 3 percent of gross domestic product, which he pointed out was \"a modest challenge relative to what most countries around the world face on the fiscal side.\" \"Our belief is that we can use the period between the election and the end of the year to negotiate a framework of reforms that can be phased in over time,\" he said. Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial nations - the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy, Britain, Germany and France - huddled during the afternoon to discuss their challenges, but did not issue a statement outlining their views. Japanese Finance Minister Koriki Jojima told reporters the G7 agreed the global recovery faced risks and that it had held in-depth discussions on monetary policy. But he declined to go into specifics. An official from the finance ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Europe was not in the firing line at the G7 meeting. \"It\\'s not the case that the meeting was dominated by a sense of pessimism about Europe, or that there was a sense the region was not doing enough,\" the official said.

The person familiar with the matter said any shift would be Braunstein\\'s decision, and would be unrelated to the trades. In July, JPMorgan announced new co-heads for commercial and investment banking and named a co-chief operating officer. Analysts believed the steps were designed to add checks and balances to the bank\\'s senior ranks after the trading losses, which have brought intense regulatory scrutiny to the bank. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters at the time that the shifts had been in the works before the bad trades, and were designed to help the bank cope with the increased complexity that financial companies face globally. Braunstein did not return a call to his cell phone seeking comment on his possible job change, and the bank declined to comment. The timing for any job change for Braunstein is unclear. The bank is set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday. The $6 billion of trading losses came from a JPMorgan group called the Chief Investment Office (CIO), which managed risk for the bank and invested deposits. The CIO group in London took large bets on derivatives, with one trader taking big enough positions to be called \"the London Whale.\" The bank first disclosed possible losses in May, and in July said that some traders may have lied about the value of their positions to the bank, adding fuel to government probes into the trades. Regulators and agencies including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are all looking at the bank. On Wednesday, Dimon told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, \"We made a stupid error. He added: \"I should have caught it ... I didn\\'t.\" Even with the trading losses, JPMorgan Chase earned $5 billion in the second quarter. In narrative accounts of the bad trades by multiple media outlets, including a more-than-7,000 word piece published in this weekend\\'s New York Times Magazine, Braunstein is not mentioned. JPMorgan said last week in an internal memo that Barry Zubrow was retiring. Zubrow was head of risk management at the bank when it was building a dangerously large position in credit derivatives. In January, months before the bank announced the bad derivatives trades, Zubrow switched to heading corporate and regulatory affairs. News of Braunstein\\'s possible job switch was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. (Additional reporting by Sarah N.

The increase comes as the government tries to shield the world\\'s second-largest economy from stiff global headwinds, including fast-tracking some infrastructure projects. The government has recently approved 25 rail projects that could be worth more than 700 billion yuan, as part of measures to stimulate the country\\'s slowing economy. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its forecast on China\\'s 2012 economic growth to 7.8 percent from 8 percent and warned of risks to emerging Asia if the euro zone crisis worsens and the United States does not avoid its \"fiscal cliff\". The Ministry of Railways said in September it would boost spending by 30 billion yuan to 610 billion yuan this year while it raised its target to 580 billion yuan by 12.4 percent in July. The government said on Wednesday it would increase state spending and offer tax breaks to quicken the development of the country\\'s urban public transport system.

That means that Green Mountain will not receive any royalties from their sale. The move by Kraft, which also owns the rival Tassimo one-cup brewer, represents the first time a big-name coffee brand skirts Green Mountain in making cups for its market-leading system. Certain Green Mountain patents related to the design of its K-Cups expired in September. Maxwell House is the third-largest retail coffee brand in the United States behind No. 1 Folgers, which is owned by J.M.

Following news of similar launches by private label brands including Kroger Co ( KR.N ), Safeway Inc ( SWY.N ) and Supervalu Inc ( SVU.N ), the move by Kraft adds more weight to the argument put forth last year by Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, who questioned the sustainability of Green Mountain's dominance in the single-serve market. Einhorn publicly disclosed a short position in the company a year ago. Aside from new K-cups coming to market, Green Mountain is also facing new competitors to its coffee brewers from the likes of Bunn, Starbucks and others.

The Libertad, a navy frigate with 200 crew, was detained in Ghana\\'s eastern port of Tema on October 2 under a court order sought by NML Capital Ltd, an affiliate of the investment firm Elliott Management. Argentina\\'s defense ministry filed a motion contesting the detention claiming sovereign immunity. It said that, due to its military nature, the vessel could not be targeted by creditors. In its ruling the commercial court in Ghana\\'s capital Accra said Argentina had forfeited such immunities when it issued the bonds. \"The defense applicant had made it so clear in the transaction agreement that it was waving such immunity and it is my view that the action being sought by the plaintiff is binding in accordance with the laws,\" the judge said in a statement. Ace Ankomah, a lawyer for NML Capital, told Reuters his clients were seeking a bond deposit worth at least $20 million before releasing the vessel. Argentina owed his clients \"well over $300 million\", he said. \"We are not insisting on cash payment, neither are we asking for the full amount. Our position is that we\\'d release the vessel if they are able to get a bank to issue the bond to us,\" Ankomah said. Bondholders like NML Capital, which the left-leaning government of President Cristina Fernandez calls vulture funds, normally target foreign bank accounts held by state-run companies or government agencies. Defense lawyers said the ship, which is used as a training vessel, was running low on fuel and appealed to the court to allow refueling to provide power for the crew, all of whom remain aboard.

      "{'text': ' Spain is comfortable putting off an international aid request for weeks or even months as it waits out German political obstacles and seeks greater definition on the European Central Bank\\'s bond-buying program, analysts and sources say. \\n In the meantime, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is focusing on measures such as intensifying labor market reforms, as well as pushing for a European banking union that would help rebuild confidence in Spain\\'s tarnished banking sector. Spain\\'s borrowing costs spiked in July, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond jumped over an unsustainable 7 percent, but tumbled after ECB head Mario Draghi unveiled a bond-buying scheme to lower Spanish borrowing costs. Spain must first sign up for a European rescue plan to trigger the bond buying. Given its debt position, the Spanish government still sees that step as inevitable but pressure has eased as investors are less willing to bet against Spain with the ECB waiting in the wings. Germany has sent Spain strong signals that it should hold off because German Chancellor Angela Merkel is wary of presenting a fresh aid request to her parliament, euro zone sources say. Sources familiar with Rajoy\\'s thinking say he also wants the ECB to indicate exactly what it will achieve with the bond-buying. Is the idea to avoid periodic volatility or to define a reasonable level for the risk premium on Spanish debt? they ask. \"We will end up there, with ECB action, but the ECB is still designing the instrument in more accurate terms,\" said a source close to the government. \"The markets understand that we have the fire extinguisher. We\\'ll see how it evolves in the coming weeks.\" Turmoil over Greece, a fresh spike in Spanish yields or a credit rating downgrade to junk status for Spanish government bonds could accelerate the process, but for now Madrid is comfortable taking it slow, the source said. Spanish officials see more risks to moving ahead quickly without assured German backing, than in delaying a request. Meanwhile, they think things are moving in the right direction. For example, criticism of Draghi\\'s plan has died down after strident objectives from European Central Bank Governing Council Member Jens Weidmann, who heads the German Bundesbank. \"We think that the current period of vacillation might last for several months if events don\\'t intervene,\" Alex White, an economist with JP Morgan in London, wrote in a research note. White said he saw little on the horizon to change Germany\\'s desire to avoid a Bundestag vote on Spain in the near-term. Then there is Rajoy\\'s personality to consider. \"Rajoy has infinite patience to put up with tension where others would break down,\" said a senior banker in Spain. Although Rajoy has said he is studying conditions for seeking European aid, there is no mystery over what the European Commission would demand of Spain in terms of structural reforms and spending cuts. Euro zone sources have said conditions are likely to be largely in line with measures the country has already taken, since Spain would not be applying for a full rescue program that would cover all of its financing needs. The International Monetary Fund has sent a strong message to European policymakers to focus on growth even as they try to correct deficits, a line Spain applauds. With the economy in a deep recession and unemployment close to 25 percent, Spanish officials point out that ECB intervention might bring liquidity, but won\\'t revive economic growth. \"With or without liquidity we have a growth problem globally, that we must start discussing,\" said the source close to the government. BANKING REFORM Rajoy has concentrated on moving forward with banking union -- under which the ECB would supervise European banks and the region would set up a deposit guarantee fund -- which he sees as key to improving Spanish banks\\' access to liquidity. After meeting French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday the two leaders called for rapid progress toward banking union [ID:nL6E8LAK52] at a European leaders\\' summit next week. However, Germany and others do not expect agreement even on cross-border supervision for a year or more. Originally, Spain was pushing for the banking union because it would have allowed the ESM rescue fund to directly recapitalize Spanish banks, keeping the cost of a financial sector rescue off the country\\'s public accounts. However, Spain is less concerned about that impact now, since it estimates it will use only 40 billion euros of the 100 billion euros of bank rescue funds lined up, equivalent to only 4 points of gross domestic product. Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro calculated the deficit would swell to 7.4 percent of GDP this year when taking the bank rescue into account, but he said the European Commission would not consider that as non-compliance with targets, since it is a one-off. But banking union is still paramount for Spain since it would foster some confidence in its financial sector, which was crippled by a decade-long building boom that collapsed four years ago leaving the banks with 184 billion euros of bad debt. Rajoy has announced 65 billion euros in budget savings by the end of 2014 to try to bring Spain\\'s deficit down drastically, in line with European Union targets. But rising unemployment, falling tax revenue and the recession are undermining his efforts. The Spanish government is acutely aware that next door, Portugal\\'s severe spending cuts have failed to revive the economy. On Tuesday, in Luxembourg at a meeting of European finance ministers, Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said the euro zone believed Spain\\'s budget cuts programme should take account of its recession. In Madrid, the source close to the government said under European rules if the government misses is deficit target because of recession, the European Commission would not apply sanctions for a missed deficit.

      "{'text': ' Standard & Poor\\'s on Wednesday cut Spain\\'s sovereign credit rating to BBB-minus, just above junk territory, citing a deepening economic recession that is limiting the government\\'s policy options to arrest the slide. \\n The S&P downgrade comes with a negative outlook reflecting the credit ratings agency\\'s view that there are significant risks to economic growth and budgetary performance, plus a lack of clear direction in euro zone policies. \"In our view, the capacity of Spain\\'s political institutions (both domestic and multilateral) to deal with the severe challenges posed by the current economic and financial crisis is declining,\" S&P said in a statement. S&P\\'s two-notch downgrade from BBB-plus brings it in line with Moody\\'s Investors Service\\'s Baa3 rating. Moody\\'s has Spain on review for a possible downgrade. Both firms have Spain just on the cusp of junk status. Fitch Ratings has a BBB rating on Spain, one notch higher, but also with a negative outlook. A spokeswoman at Spain\\'s Economy Ministry told Reuters the government had no comment on the ratings action. The country has been in recession since earlier this year, its second economic contraction in just a few years, and unemployment is stubbornly high at close to 25 percent with a return to job creation still two years away. Falling tax revenue and rising costs of unemployment benefits are confounding the government\\'s efforts to hit a 2012 deficit reduction target of 6.3 percent of gross domestic target agreed with the European Union. Both the International Monetary Fund and Spain\\'s own Central Bank cast doubt on the savings envisioned in Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy\\'s 2013 budget, saying they are based on a too-rosy outlook for the economy. In the wake of the downgrade, the euro dropped about 0.25 percent to $1.2865 in late New York trade from just under $1.29 prior to the news. \"This is weighing on the euro. A downgrade from S&P could be followed by a downgrade from Moody\\'s, and while S&P did not downgrade Spain to junk, Moody\\'s might,\" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. \"If Moody\\'s goes to junk status, that\\'s even more significant, and this adds to the pressure on Moody\\'s to make a decision. It could lead to higher bond yields in Spain and push the government closer to asking for a bailout,\" Lien added. In European trade earlier on Tuesday, ten-year Spanish bond yields fell 1 basis point to 5.83 percent. Those yields spiked above 7 percent earlier this year, but have since come down on a European Central Bank bond-buying plan. SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND EURO ZONE DOUBTS Prime Minister Rajoy\\'s centre-right People\\'s Party has an absolute majority in parliament and so far has been able to pass spending cuts and economic reforms without any problem. However, street protests have increased in recent months as Spaniards revolt against public sector wage cuts and lower spending on education and healthcare. Resentment is also rising over huge public bailouts for the country\\'s crippled banks, while social benefits are cut. Although Rajoy\\'s PP governs 11 of 17 Spanish regions, which have been forced to make massive budget cuts, S&P noted that tensions between the central and regional governments are rising, \"leading to substantially diluted policy outcomes.\" The agency said Rajoy\\'s resolve will be \"repeatedly tested by domestic constituencies.\" Although the European Central Bank has set up a bond-buying program that would support Spanish debt prices on the secondary market, Spain has balked at signing up for international aid because it would come with harsh conditions. \"We view the Spanish government\\'s hesitation to agree to a formal assistance program ... as potentially raising the downside risks to Spain\\'s rating,\" S&P said in its note. The agency also said that euro zone policy makers must show progress on implementing a banking union that would allow Europe to directly recapitalize Spanish banks, taking the weight off of the Spanish government.

      "{'text': ' In a tax fight that could jolt the real estate business, Howard Hughes Corp is challenging the U.S. Internal Revenue Service over a $144.1 million tax bill stemming from land sales at Summerlin, an enormous planned community in southern Nevada. \\n The dispute centers on an accounting practice - known as the \"completed contract method\" - that the IRS has scrutinized for years. A Tax Court trial is scheduled for November 5 in Las Vegas. The IRS contends, according to court records, that Howard Hughes improperly deferred taxes on income from sales of residential lots at Summerlin, which sprawls across 35 square miles on the western fringe of Las Vegas. The company should pay taxes as it books the lot sales and not wait until the project is nearly finished, the IRS said. But Howard Hughes says its use of the method is permissible under an IRS exemption for home construction, and that developers pay up-front costs and do not know their ultimate taxable gains until a project is almost finished. Both the company and the IRS declined to comment. Dallas-based Howard Hughes is a spinoff from General Growth Properties. Though Howard Hughes is the company in court, General Growth is liable for tax payments if the IRS wins, according to the spinoff agreement. General Growth declined to comment. Activist investor William Ackman is chairman of Howard Hughes. Ackman\\'s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management LP, owned 3.6 million Howard Hughes shares as of June 30. The IRS said in September 2009 that companies using the completed contract accounting method to defer income from land sales for years, or even a decade or more, could trigger an audit. The IRS has other Tax Court challenges pending with property developers over the completed contract method, or CCM. \"Taxpayers\\' misuse of the CCM is a growing trend within the residential construction industry,\" the IRS said in a September 2009 internal memo, one of several posted on the IRS website. HIGH STAKES FOR INDUSTRY An IRS win in Tax Court could mean property developers would need to pay taxes on a \"percentage-of-completion\" accounting method, a less-favorable approach for businesses. The IRS is \"taking a pretty hard-line position, saying that you just are not entitled to the completed-contract method,\" said David Auclair, principal at accounting firm Grant Thornton. \"This is a big issue for land developers and commercial real estate,\" he said. Homebuilders also use the completed contract method. In July, California-based Shea Homes LP went to trial with the IRS over this issue. The company could owe up to $61 million in federal and state taxes, Shea said in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Wilkes Graham, senior vice president at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC, said a court loss for Howard Hughes and General Growth would not deal a blow to their shareholders. But, he said, the challenge to the accounting method will be watched by other companies. \"It\\'s a bigger deal overall,\" he said. For companies using the completed contract method, \"those entities would be at risk\" if the IRS wins, he said. Howard Hughes got a tax bill in February 2011 for allegedly under-paying taxes in 2007 and 2008 on Summerlin, a project that the company does not expect to sell out until 2039. Hurt by the recent financial crisis, Summerlin\\'s acreage sales are starting to recover this year. The development\\'s land covers an area half the size of the District of Columbia. As a developer, Howard Hughes builds the infrastructure at Summerlin - roads, sewer and water, electricity. The company makes money when it sells developed properties to home builders. A Tax Court loss by Howard Hughes would hurt the development industry just as it is starting to recover. Developers beginning new projects may need to pay taxes sooner, adding an up-front cost for the businesses, said Richard Shavell, a vice chairman at the Associated Builders and Contractors, an industry group. \"If the IRS wins, they could cause a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.

      "{'text': ' Greece, Spain and the euro zone\\'s slow progress toward debt reform take centre stage at IMF meetings on Friday despite Europe\\'s best effort to remove itself from the spotlight. \\n The International Monetary Fund recommended that some of Europe\\'s debt-burdened countries take a bit more time to reduce budget deficits, arguing that moving too fast is counter-productive because it hurts the economy. But Germany, Europe\\'s largest creditor country and the key to any lasting fiscal reforms, pushed back against that advice and said reversing course on promised deficit reductions would only weaken credibility. \"The euro zone does not lack the financial wherewithal to stem the crisis. What it lacks is the political will,\" former IMF official Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, wrote in the International Herald Tribune. While the IMF has advocated a slower approach to debt reduction, it urged swifter policy action, both in Europe and the United States, to remove economic uncertainty and help lift anemic global economic growth. \"We expect action, courageous and cooperative action on the part of our members,\" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said, spelling out her expectations for the twice-yearly meetings that start on Friday. In Europe, the IMF wants to see more progress toward promised reforms that would create a tighter fiscal and banking union. In the United States, the IMF has sounded the alarm over the \"fiscal cliff\" of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that take effect early next year unless Congress acts. European officials insist they are on track to deliver reforms, and want to see closer scrutiny of the U.S. fiscal issues instead. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Washington has a window of opportunity to address the fiscal cliff after the November 6 presidential election. Both topics will be on the agenda, along with the IMF\\'s own internal reform efforts, which have stalled. The Fund was supposed to have completed by the Tokyo meetings a set of voting reforms that would give fast-growing emerging markets greater say in the international lender and vault China to the No. 3 spot. But U.S. presidential politics got in the way. The Obama administration is reluctant to seek congressional approval for additional IMF funding when the budget deficit is such a hot-button election issue. Without U.S. support, the IMF reforms lack sufficient votes to pass.

      "{'text': ' A U.S. appeals court overturned a pretrial sales ban against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\\'s Galaxy Nexus smartphone, dealing a setback to Apple Inc in its battle against Google Inc\\'s increasingly popular mobile software. \\n Apple is waging war on several fronts against Google, whose Android software powers many of Samsung\\'s devices. The ruling on Thursday from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is not expected to have an outsized impact on the smartphone market, as the Nexus is an aging product in Samsung\\'s lineup. Apple\\'s stock closed down nearly 2 percent at $628.10. However, the court\\'s reasoning could make it much harder for companies that sue over patents get competitors\\' products pulled from the market, said Colleen Chien, a professor at Santa Clara Law school in Silicon Valley. Such sales injunctions have been a key for companies trying to increase their leverage in courtroom patent fights. \"The Federal Circuit has said, \\'Wait a minute,\\'\" Chien said. Apple declined to comment, while Samsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple scored a sweeping legal victory over Samsung in August when a U.S. jury found Samsung had copied critical features of the hugely popular iPhone and iPad and awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages. The Nexus phone was not included in that trial, but is part of a tandem case Apple filed against Samsung earlier this year. District Judge Lucy Koh issued a pretrial injunction against the Nexus in June, based on an Apple patent for unified search capability. The appeals court then stayed that injunction until it could formally rule. In its opinion on Thursday, the Federal Circuit reversed the injunction entirely, saying that Koh abused her discretion. Apple failed to prove that consumers purchased the Samsung product because of the infringing technology, the appeals court ruled. \"It may very well be that the accused product would sell almost as well without incorporating the patented feature,\" the court wrote. \"And in that case, even if the competitive injury that results from selling the accused device is substantial, the harm that flows from the alleged infringement (the only harm that should count) is not.\" The court considered a single patent - one which allows the smartphone to search multiple data storage locations at once. For example, the smartphone could search the device\\'s memory as well as the Internet with a single query. The appeals court has sent the case back to Koh for reconsideration. A separate pretrial sales ban Apple had managed to win against Samsung - targeting the Galaxy Tab 10.1 - was dissolved earlier this month after Samsung won at trial on that patent. Beyond the Nexus, Samsung also has a collection of new tablets and smartphones intended for launch before the holidays. On Wednesday, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt called the intensifying struggle between Apple and his company a \"defining fight\" for the future of the mobile industry. The case in the Federal Circuit is Apple Inc vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al., 12-1507. (Reporting By Diane Bartz; Editing by Gerald E.

The magnitude of policy reforms we have to agree on to achieve sustainability are somewhere between 2 to 3 percent of GDP. They\\'re a very modest set of changes and if you do it in a balanced way with a mix of tax reforms ad spending cuts you can do a very good job of gradual reforms and still create some room for investments.\" GEITHNER ON EUROPE \"Even though they have a lot of details to work out, the agreement on that basic framework makes it much easier for Europe to navigate what is going to be a long difficult period of reform.\" GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLE \"There is no country in Europe which would give any thought to the question of abolishing the euro.\" \"I am convinced that we will be able to tell our friends and partners around the world that Europe is in the process of solving its problems and Europe is aware of its responsibility.\" \"We are convinced that in Germany and Europe it is of central importance ...that the public believes that there are reasons to trust the long-term foundations of our policies.\" \"Therefore, we believe that we will fulfill our international obligations with our policy of growth-friendly deficit reduction.\" SCHAEUBLE ON CONSOLIDATION\\'S NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GROWTH \"One should also consider the advantages of the common currency.

In the medium to long term, we need to tackle fiscal discipline and economic growth as a pair of wheels.

Japan has enacted a law to increase the sales tax to 10 percent as part of effort to achieve prime budget balance by fiscal 2020/21 ... and this shows our stance of sincerely adhering to our promise to international society.\" JOJIMA ON CURRENCIES: \"Despite the fragile economic fundamentals, a strong yen is continuing. I told (IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde) about our concern that further yen gains would pose major downside risks to the Japanese economy, which is recovering from (last year\\'s) earthquake. Managing Director Lagarde told me that the yen is somewhat overvalued.\" JOJIMA ON EUROPE AND CHINA (after the G7 meeting): \"I said it is important for Europe to fulfill its responsibility to steadily carry out agreed steps and that I expect that will ensure market stability.\" \"Chinese economy is slowing down but there\\'s room for fiscal and monetary policy steps to achieve its growth target of 7.5 percent.

Europe must make its own efforts to prevent the spread of the crisis and to stabilize the market.

We hope that European countries will overcome conflicts in opinions and strengthen their efforts to unite together and establish a monetary union in the true meaning. Japan is ready to make contributions as necessary while keeping watch on these European efforts.\" JOJIMA ON S.KOREA COOPERATION \"I discussed with South Korean minister Bahk the global and regional economic situation. We agreed that both countries would cooperate in the framework of the G20 and ASEAN 3 and that our finance authorities will closely work with each other on the economic and financial front.

Rubenstein also pointed to the fiscal cliff - the year-end expiration of tax cuts and triggering of spending cuts - as a major cause of uncertainty within the business community. \"Everywhere I go in the world, people care about the fiscal cliff,\" he said. \"It\\'s not like many things that get overly dramatized.\" However, Rubenstein said it is unlikely the lame-duck Congress will make any sweeping changes. \"We\\'ll probably kick it down the road for six months to give the next president and the next Congress an opportunity to really focus on it,\" he said. During the interview, Rubenstein touched on several other topics, including Carlyle\\'s aggressive dealmaking this year.

      "{'text': ' U.S. unemployment remains \"painfully high\" while inflation is not an immediate concern, giving the Federal Reserve plenty of reason to launch a new stimulus last month, a top Fed official said on Thursday. \\n Jeremy Stein, in his first keynote speech since becoming a Fed governor in May, said he strongly supported the U.S. central bank\\'s decision to embark on a new, open-ended bond-buying program. His comments suggest that despite cries of foul from a handful of hawkish regional Fed bank presidents, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke had solid backing for the third round of quantitative easing, or QE3, announced in September. Stein said the plan was needed to boost an economy that was growing too slowly to bring down the nation\\'s unemployment rate, currently at 7.8 percent. \"It appears that the economy is growing at a pace such that, absent policy action, progress on reducing unemployment will likely be slow for some time,\" Stein told an event at the Brookings Institution. \"Given where we are, and what we know, I firmly believe that this decision was the right one.\" U.S. economic growth registered a paltry 1.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter and economists polled by Reuters see a still anemic 1.7 percent clip for the third quarter. Stein offered a detailed explanation of how he estimates the effect of the new asset purchases will help economic growth. The purchases kick off with $40 billion per month in mortgage-bond buying. He estimated a hypothetical $500 billion in Treasury purchases would lower yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes by about 0.15-0.20 percentage point. Stein added there was a boost to stock prices and corporate bond markets as well. But he said there was an even deeper impact from the psychological boost to confidence among consumers and businesses. \"(The) overall impact of (asset buys) may be augmented via a signaling or confidence channel,\" Stein said. Describing some of the potential costs of unorthodox monetary easing from the Fed, Stein concluded - like the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee - that the risks are manageable and worth taking. He said the Fed has the tools and the will to raise interest rates if inflation becomes a problem. FED ON BUBBLE WATCH Stein said the Fed is cognizant of the possibility that low interest rates could lead to asset bubbles by forcing investors to take undue risks, and that the Fed would monitor such prospects closely. But he added current conditions offer little cause for alarm, arguing low rates may actually contribute to financial stability by making it easier for firms to rely less heavily on short-term financing. He pushed back against the notion that the Fed might be shooting for higher inflation, saying this would risk the central bank\\'s credibility without offering any obvious benefits. \"I disagree with the premise that what we\\'re doing is seeking to gin up inflation,\" Stein said in response to questions from the audience. Stein also dismissed the notion that easy monetary policy only helps wealthy individuals by boosting stock prices. On balance, lower income earners tend to have higher debt levels, he said, and are therefore net beneficiaries of the Fed\\'s ultra-low rates. He acknowledged that the weakening of the dollar that tends to accompany the Fed\\'s monetary stimulus is of some benefit to economic growth but argued that this is not a dominant channel through which Fed policy affects the economy. In response to the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-2009, the Fed cut official rates to effectively zero and more than tripled its balance sheet to around $2.8 trillion.

      "{'text': ' The Federal Reserve\\'s stated intention to keep interest rates ultra low for nearly three more years is suggesting to some that the Fed is willing to cut the jobless rate at the expense of higher inflation, putting the central bank\\'s credibility at risk, a top official of the U.S. central bank said on Thursday \\n Charles Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed and one of the most hawkish of the Fed\\'s 19 policymakers, in a speech on Thursday weighed in on the simmering debate over just how high U.S. monetary policymakers would allow inflation to rise in order to boost weak economic growth and lower unemployment. The debate has amplified - both among Fed policymakers and outside economists - since the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last month launched a third and potentially massive round of asset purchases and said it expected to keep short-term borrowing costs near zero through mid-2015. Plosser, in the text of a speech, said keeping the federal funds rate so low for so long \"would risk destabilizing inflation expectations and lead to an unwanted\" rise in inflation. \"In fact, some are interpreting the FOMC\\'s statement that we will keep accommodation in place for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens as an indication that the Fed is focused on trying to lower the unemployment rate and is willing to tolerate higher inflation to do so,\" he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Southern Chester County Chamber of Commerce, in Avondale, Pennsylvania. \"This is another risk to the hard-won credibility the institution has built up over many years, which, if lost, will undermine economic stability,\" he said. U.S. economic growth cooled in the second quarter to a tepid 1.3 percent annual rate, and forecasters do not think the economy is expanding much faster now. Though unemployment fell sharply to 7.8 percent last month, from 8.1 percent in August, analysts doubt that improvement can be sustained. Inflation, meanwhile, has remained relatively stable near the Fed\\'s 2 percent target for almost three years. It is now tracking slightly below that target. Since the Fed\\'s latest easing move, three of Plosser\\'s colleagues - Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Narayana Kocherlakota of Minneapolis and John Williams of San Francisco - have each specified how high above 2 percent they would allow inflation to rise before tightening policy. Economic theory suggests that higher inflation expectations have the same impact as easier monetary policy: lowering inflation-adjusted \"real\" interest rates, and encouraging borrowing, investment and hiring. \"We know that monetary policy can control inflation, but its ability to manage the unemployment rate is far more dubious,\" said Plosser, who does not have a vote this year on Fed policy. \"Chasing an elusive goal for unemployment could well risk losing control over inflation,\" he added. \"That was the lesson of the Great Inflation during the 1970s.\" (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by Leslie Adler)', 'date': ' Thu Oct 11, 2012 12:33pm EDT\\n', 'title': \" Fed's Plosser warns on sending the wrong inflation signals\\n\", 'author': ' \\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-usa-fed-plosser-idUSBRE89A15K20121011\\n\\n \\n\\n AVONDALE, Penn.

      "{'text': ' Asian economies will likely register another year of weak growth in 2013, despite pockets of mild recovery expected in some countries as central banks continue to keep policy accommodative, a Reuters poll showed. \\n But much will hinge on whether China, Asia\\'s largest economy, can pull out of its downtrend this year, if the U.S. economy can continue to gain traction and if the euro zone can contain its prolonged debt crisis. Forecasts for nearly all of the 12 economies polled in October were downgraded from the last quarterly poll conducted in July. \"Next year will probably be quite a difficult year for most Asian economies,\" said Vishnu Varthan, economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank. \"A lot of these economies still have their umbilical cords tied to China and whether China eases policy and its magnitude will probably decide the course of growth in the region.\" After starting off 2012 in relatively good shape compared to their Western peers, one Asian economy after another began quickly succumbing to the global downdraft as the year progressed and demand for the region\\'s exports deteriorated in the United States, Europe and then China. China is scheduled to publish third-quarter GDP data next week, with investors anticipating a seventh straight quarter of slowing growth, and economists were reluctant to make fresh forecasts so close to the release date as they run the risk of having to immediately revise their assumptions. The last Reuters poll of economists four weeks ago was taken in the wake of weaker-than-expected data for August and revealed a sharp cut to their third-quarter growth call to 7.4 percent year-on-year from a 7.9 percent consensus forecast just two months earlier. Investors have repeatedly pushed back their expectations of when China\\'s economy would hit the bottom of the current growth cycle. The consensus view at the start of 2012 was that the first quarter would be the nadir. It has since moved to the third quarter, with the economy set for its slowest full year of growth since 1999. Reuters polls also showed that Asia\\'s second-largest economy, Japan, is stumbling and likely shrank in the third quarter as the slowdown in China and the euro zone\\'s woes take a bigger toll on the export-reliant nation than previously anticipated. The economy is expected to grow just 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter after a predicted 0.1 percent contraction in the third quarter, the poll of 26 economists taken October 2-9 showed. For the full year to March 2013, the economy is expected to grow 1.7 percent, revised down from a 1.8 percent expansion projected last month, and the lowest estimate since the first forecast in February 2011. The poll also saw a slightly lowered growth forecast for the next fiscal year to 1.4 percent from a 1.5 percent expansion in the previous survey. Graphic for the poll:  link.reuters.com/vub59s WORST OVER FOR INDIA? But economists said the worst may be over for India\\'s economy, with one big proviso: the federal government must continue to push through and stick to politically unpopular reforms. The Reuters poll showed India\\'s growth slump has likely passed and the economy will gradually recover over the next year, though the rate of expansion for this fiscal year will still be the weakest in a decade. GDP in Asia\\'s third-largest economy will likely grow 6.6 percent in the fiscal year to March 2014, after expected 5.7 percent growth in this fiscal year. That compared to 6.3 percent and 7.0 percent growth predicted in the last poll in July. Optimism has risen since New Delhi announced a slew of reforms last month to mend the government\\'s finances, but economists warned that failure to stick to the path of reforms will likely throw the country back into a period of low growth. LIQUID OPTIMISM Hopes for a turnaround beginning in the fourth quarter have been influenced by several factors. Optimism in world financial markets has shown some improvement after the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank agreed to launch new rounds of bond buying to help boost their fragile economies and reignite global growth. \"Tail risks to global growth has been substantially mitigated by the decisive action of the ECB and Fed,\" said Wai Ho Leong, economist at Barclays. Attention has also focused on more encouraging though still erratic economic data from the United States, although nothing so far is pointing to anything more than a sluggish recovery. The U.S. is now expected to grow at less than 2 percent over the remaining months of the year, while the euro zone will likely find itself mired in recession for some time. That is unlikely to bode well for Asia\\'s export-driven economies such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, all of which have slashed growth forecasts for both this year and next. POCKETS OF RECOVERY Australia and New Zealand, two of Asia\\'s largest commodity driven economies, are expected to grow at a slightly faster pace this year. \"There will still be quite a bit of tiering within Asian economies. Depending on where commodity prices are going that will impact how Australia, the Philippines (and others) grow,\" said Varthan. With growth in focus and inflation expected to remain relatively subdued, most central banks in the region are expected to keep policy accommodative into 2013. The poll showed most central banks will likely keep interest rates on hold in coming months, though India\\'s central bank is expected to cut its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points by December. South Korea\\'s central bank cut rates on Thursday for the second time in four months, as expected, while Indonesia kept rates unchanged at a record low while conceding that domestic demand, while still robust, was not as high as expected as the global downturn drags on.

      "{'text': ' Apple Inc\\'s largest contract manufacturer has been pushing for a Chinese worker left brain-damaged in a factory accident to be removed from hospital in a case that throws a harsh new spotlight on labor rights in China. \\n Zhang Tingzhen, 26, an employee of Taiwan firm Foxconn, had nearly half his brain surgically removed after surviving an electric shock at a plant in southern China a year ago. He remains in hospital under close observation by doctors, unable to speak or walk properly. However, Foxconn, which is paying Zhang\\'s hospital bills, has been sending telephone text messages to his family since July, demanding they remove him from hospital and threatening to cut off funding for his treatment - a move the firm says would be justified under Chinese labor law. Foxconn confirmed it had sent the messages, saying that under Chinese law the worker must submit himself to a disability assessment - a process that in Zhang\\'s case would require him to be discharged from the Shenzhen hospital and travel 70 km (43 miles) to Huizhou, where he was first hired by Foxconn. The firm said in response to emailed questions that it would be prepared to return Zhang to the Shenzhen hospital after the assessment, though his father said Zhang was unfit to travel and that doctors felt he remained at risk of a brain haemorrhage. The case has raised fresh questions over the labor record of Foxconn, one of the biggest and most high-profile private employers in China, after a series of well-publicized suicides among its army of around a million workers and recent outbursts of labor unrest. It has angered labor activists who say Zhang\\'s plight also highlights China\\'s patchy and sometimes precarious welfare system for workers seriously injured in industrial accidents - and point out that there are many workers worse off than Zhang. \"They kept sending me SMSs every day to get my son out of hospital and to appear before an injury assessment body or they will stop paying all expenses, including his medical fees and our living expenses,\" said Zhang\\'s father, Zhang Guangde. \"You cannot imagine the suffering they put me through, how I had to fight every inch of the way just to get money so we can take care of our son,\" he added, speaking at his son\\'s bedside at the Number 2 People\\'s Hospital in Shenzhen. Zhang was repairing a spotlight on an external wall at a Foxconn factory in Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, when he received an electric shock and fell four meters (12 feet) to the ground. He has since undergone five operations, has lost his memory, is incontinent and requires careful, regular monitoring. \\'ROBBED OF DIGNITY\\' Workers who are disabled in workplace accidents and covered by insurance are eligible for compensation payouts, once their disability is assessed and graded by a panel of medical experts. The assessment is done after medical treatment is finished. Foxconn sent the text messages, and according to Zhang\\'s father at one point briefly halted payments to the family, despite a provincial law stipulating that injured workers can remain in treatment for up to two years before they must be assessed for disability compensation. The company, however, denied that it delayed or stopped payments, saying it paid them on time. Zhang, whose case was alerted to Reuters by labor activists, has been in hospital since October 2011. Doctors at the Number 2 People\\'s Hospital declined to comment for this article, but Zhang\\'s father, 50, said they had not indicated that he could be discharged and had said they needed to keep his son under observation after implanting a tube in his body to drain fluid from his brain cavity to his bladder. \"The doctor told me they needed to monitor his condition and that for such serious injuries, a person was allowed to be treated in hospital for up to two years. After that, assessors can order treatment to be prolonged,\" the father said. Labor activists in China say Zhang is just one of many thousands of Chinese workers who are left permanently disabled or chronically ill by workplace accidents, at the mercy of a system that often requires them and their families to fight degrading battles for treatment funding and compensation. \"China now has laws specifying the types of compensation that are due to workers. But in many serious industrial accidents, companies still put workers or their families through a lot of suffering just to get what is due to them,\" said Choi Suet-wah of the Chinese Working Women Network in Hong Kong. \"They are robbed of their dignity,\" said Choi, who has extensive experience working with migrant workers in China. Zhang is actually one of the lucky ones, social workers say, pointing out that Foxconn has at least been paying his hospital bills and the living expenses of his family, which has moved to Shenzhen from central China to be with him. They estimate that at least four out of 10 Chinese workers are not covered by any kind of insurance and are left to fend for themselves when seriously injured in the workplace - despite laws requiring all employers to insure their workers. \"This is just one of many, many industrial accidents in China. And you almost certainly never get what you are entitled to, especially in serious cases,\" Choi said. WELFARE BORDERS Foxconn says it is insured against workplace accidents, which means its insurer would meet the cost of a compensation payment once Zhang\\'s disability is finally assessed. But compensation in China can vary depending on the city in which a worker\\'s disability is assessed - and this, according to Zhang\\'s family, is why Foxconn wants him to travel to Huizhou and refuses to have him assessed in Shenzhen. Labor activists say wages and compensation levels are all substantially lower in Huizhou than in Shenzhen, one of the most expensive cities in China. When asked why Zhang could not be assessed in Shenzhen, Foxconn said the law required him to go to Huizhou because he had signed his employment contract there. It added that it was prepared to send him back to the hospital in Shenzhen if the assessors determined that he required more medical attention. In hospital, Zhang walks unsteadily, holding on to the bed frames of other patients in his shared room and, with a smile, sits down next to his father whose face tightens with emotion. \"He calls me \\'mother\\' and calls my wife \\'father\\'. He can only mimic words you ask him to say, it is meaningless,\" the elder Zhang said later, holding a jar containing large fragments of his son\\'s cranium. Doctors replaced a portion of Zhang\\'s skull with synthetic bone. He said that despite Foxconn\\'s funding - a monthly allowance of 11,000 yuan ($1,800) plus treatment costs - the family had racked up 200,000 yuan ($31,800) in debt to pay for medicines not provided by the hospital and other expenses. Back home in central Henan province, the family was building a house for Zhang to live in after his impending marriage when he was injured. \"We were building a three-storey house,\" the elder Zhang said. \"The project has since been abandoned and all the building materials we bought have been washed away by rain. But these workers still have to be paid. My whole life is over.\" (Additional reporting by China bureau; Editing by  Mark Bendeich  and  Nick Macfie )', 'date': ' Wed Oct 10, 2012 9:19pm EDT\\n', 'title': \" Worker's injury casts harsh new light on Foxconn and China\\n\", 'author': ' By Tan Ee Lyn\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-china-foxconn-worker-idUSBRE89A02T20121011\\n\\n \\n\\n HONG KONG  ('}\n",

      "{'text': ' Oil major BP Plc has secured U.S. government permission to ship U.S. crude oil to Canada, and Royal Dutch Shell has applied for an export license, as rising production in the world\\'s top oil consumer upends global energy flows. \\n A surge in output from shale oil reserves in the Bakken of North Dakota and Eagle Ford of Texas has raised U.S. domestic production to the highest level since 1995, light, sweet crude that could fetch better prices on international markets. The United States still imports more than 8 million barrels per day, making it the world\\'s biggest importer. BP Plc received a crude export license this summer from the Bureau of Industry and Security, a branch of the US Commerce Department, to ship crude oil to Canada, a source familiar with the issue said on Thursday. BP has yet to export any crude oil on that license, the source said. \"We have applied to the Department of Commerce to export domestic U.S. crude oil,\" Shell spokeswoman Kayla Macke told Reuters, adding that as a global commodity, imports and exports would follow supply and demand. Macke declined to comment on the likely export destinations or the volumes of crude involved. A nearly century-old U.S. law requires companies to get a special license to export crude oil. Until recently, there has been no demand for overseas shipments, apart from a trickle of crude from Alaska that has been routinely exported. The Financial Times first reported the news, saying Swiss-based trading firm Vitol applied for a license, citing people familiar with the matter. \"Other than routine movement between Canada and the United States, we have not been involved in any crude oil export requests,\" a Vitol spokesman said. Experts say some U.S. crude oil has routinely moved through Canada or has been refined over the border, but must be reimported to the United States. The FT said the Department of Commerce refused to confirm or deny the existence of license applications or licenses, but quoted the DOC as saying exports to Canada had a \"presumption of approval\". But domestic U.S. refiners, especially on the Gulf Coast, were built to process cheaper, heavier types of crude from Mexico or Saudi Arabia, and are often ill-suited for refining the lighter crudes and natural gas liquids created by the U.S. boom in hydraulic fracturing or \\'fracking\\'.

      "{'text': ' The creation of a unified European airspace is seriously off track, potentially requiring the European Union to use sanctions to force compliance from member states, European Commissioner for Transport Siim Kallas said in Cyprus on Thursday. \\n Although the European Union dissolved customs borders and passport controls for much of the continent years ago, control of the skies overhead remains fragmented between nations. \"We have fallen seriously behind in our original ambitions. After more than 10 years, the core problems remain the same,\" Kallas told a conference in Limassol. \"At this stage, it looks like infringements may well be necessary,\" Kallas said. The Single European Sky II package is an EU plan to scale down from 27 national airspaces to nine regional blocks by December, with the ultimate aim of one single air control system. But countries have been slow to dismantle domestic air traffic monopolies in order to form the regional blocks, and the EU may launch investigations into sanctioning countries who won\\'t make good on the agreement. The Commission can force member states to follow EU law through a procedure known as infringement, which begins with a formal demand and can escalate into EU court action and fines. According to the EU\\'s executive, the European Commission, the patchwork control of Europe\\'s airspace leads to more than 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in extra costs per year that gets passed on to passengers. Air traffic control costs make up 6-12 percent of the cost of an airline ticket. Kallas said the price paid in the EU for using antiquated 1950\\'s-era systems makes the bloc uncompetitive. The EU was \"a long way off the price in the United States...which already controls the same airspace area with more traffic at half the cost,\" he said. Full implementation of the EU single sky plan would triple the amount of capacity for flights and improve safety tenfold, the Commission said. Due to the national control of airspaces, flights also have to take longer and more inefficient routes, adding an extra 42 kilometers to each flight in Europe. This in turn results in wasted fuel and increased emissions.

      "{'text': ' The European Union\\'s top official fleshed out his ideas for a separate budget for euro zone countries on Thursday, and indirectly warned British Prime Minister David Cameron about using the proposal for his own political gain. \\n At a conference to discuss the state of Europe after nearly three years of debt and financial crisis, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, said a separate euro zone budget was an idea that needed close examination. Even if it is a long-term project and there are a host of political and financial obstacles to overcome, it could help underpin the stability of the single currency, he said. \"We have to do everything to stabilize the situation in the euro zone, and if a fiscal capacity or a separate budget can help and can contribute to this stability, then you have to reflect on it, to discuss it,\" he told conference delegates, who included several ministers from EU member states. \"Every currency union needs also a fiscal capacity, and certainly a fiscal capacity to stabilize the euro zone.\" The 27 countries in the European Union currently finance a budget which amounts to around 130 billion euros a year - 1 percent of EU output - and which is used for spending on agriculture, science, infrastructure and other areas. But there is no equivalent budget among the 17 countries that share the euro, a shortcoming that many economists believe has undermined the stability of the currency project. Van Rompuy first raised the possibility of a separate euro zone budget in September and developed his thinking in a document sent to EU capitals in early October. It forms part of a series of initiatives to try to resolve the debt crisis. Germany and France strongly support the proposal and, in a surprise to many EU diplomats, Britain does too, but for different reasons. Cameron sees a euro zone budget as a way of further separating Britain and its increasingly EU-skeptical electorate from the currency bloc and its problems. He also sees a euro zone fund as a way of potentially reducing the amount Britain has to pay into the EU budget, which is negotiated annually as part of a seven-year framework. The issue has become particularly acute as the EU prepares to negotiate the next seven-year plan at a summit in November, a deal Cameron has threatened to veto unless he gets his way. \"There will come a time when you need to have two European budgets, one for the single currency, because they are going to have to support each other more, and perhaps a wider budget for everybody else,\" Cameron said on Sunday, the first day of his Conservative Party\\'s annual conference. Asked if he was prepared to block the long-term EU budget if spending wasn\\'t cut further, Cameron replied: \"If we cannot get a deal that has proper control of that budget, if they put forward ideas for massive increases, I won\\'t say yes to it.\" TOUGH NEGOTIATION The concern for Van Rompuy and others is that Cameron is combining very early discussions on the possibility of a euro zone fund with negotiations on the EU budget, and by doing so putting both processes at risk. \"I want to clear out any confusion - this must not be mixed up with the European Union\\'s multi-annual budget,\" Van Rompuy told the \"Friends of Europe\" conference. \"Since we decide on a multi-annual financial framework in November, it is important that we don\\'t start mixing up that discussion with the embryonic idea\" of a euro zone budget. \"The objectives are different and the timeframes are completely, completely different,\" he said, adding that those who try to mix the two should be careful. But beyond trying to keep Cameron from muddying the waters, Van Rompuy also faces a battle to try to convince the European Commission and several euro zone member states that having a separate budget for them is a good idea. Van Rompuy\\'s thinking - firmly backed by Germany - is that some form of \"fiscal capacity\" among the euro-area countries will allow them to iron out labor market and other socio-economic imbalances that build up in the bloc. The fund could be used to help a country such as Spain, which has unemployment of 25 percent and is struggling to reinvigorate growth. In exchange for budget rigor, the pan-euro zone fund could provide targeted assistance. \"The fiscal capacity could perform stabilizing functions specific to the euro zone, for instance help countries absorb asymmetric shocks over economic cycles, so we limit the adjustment cost in terms of growth and employment,\" Van Rompuy said. \"This would also make the euro area as a whole more resilient.\" While economically it may make sense, politically it is likely to prove challenging to convince all 17 countries that they need to pay more into a fund they hope they never need.

The attackers, on a motorcycle, opened fire on Qassem Aqlan - who headed an embassy security investigation team - near his house in the center of Yemen\\'s capital, the source told Reuters. \"This operation has the fingerprints of al Qaeda which carried out similar operations before,\" said the source, who asked not to be named. Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and other militant groups strengthened their grip on parts of the country during an uprising that ousted veteran President Ali Abdullah Saleh in February. Washington, wary of the growing power of al Qaeda, has stepped up drone strikes on suspected militants, with the backing of Saleh\\'s successor, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. A neighbor who identified himself only as Fahad said he had noticed strangers roaming the streets over the past three days, suggesting Aqlan was being watched before the attack. \"Once he (Aqlan) stepped out of his house the men shouted his name and when he replied, they shot him in the head and neck,\" he said. Aqlan, who was in his 50s and had worked at the embassy for more than a decade, was responsible for coordinating security information between the U.S. Embassy and the Yemeni authorities, the source added. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that his main duties included conducting personnel checks as head of the \"foreign service national investigative unit\" and serving as a liaison with Yemeni security services. He worked within the office of the embassy\\'s \"regional security officer,\" who is responsible protecting the embassy, its personnel and information. She also said initial reports that he was involved in the investigation into the attack last month on the U.S. Embassy by protesters angry over an anti-Islam film made in the United States were incorrect. \"We condemn this vicious act in the strongest terms,\" the spokeswoman said but declined to comment on who may have been behind the attack or why Aqlan may have been targeted, saying it may or may not have had anything to do with his work. There have been a number of killings and assassination attempts on security officials and politicians since Yemen\\'s army drove Islamist fighters out of several southern towns earlier this year. Last month Abdulilah Al-Ashwal, a senior intelligence official, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Sanaa. Restoring stability in Yemen has become an international priority due to fears that al Qaeda could become further entrenched in a country which flanks oil producer Saudi Arabia and lies along major international shipping lanes. AQAP, regarded as al Qaeda\\'s strongest regional wing, has mounted operations in Saudi Arabia and tried to launch attacks against the United States.

      "{'text': ' Indonesia\\'s powerful Bakrie family has proposed splitting from financier Nat Rothschild and Bumi Plc, the London-listed miner they co-founded two years ago, after news of an inquiry into possible wrongdoing strained their already tense relations. \\n The dramatic plan put to board directors and key investors on Wednesday night would see the Bakries taking back their Indonesian assets with deals worth an estimated $1.38 billion. If their share swap and cash purchases proceed, they would exit Bumi Plc and dismantle the company they created with Rothschild, drawing a line under the family\\'s ill-fated London venture. The potential unraveling of Bumi Plc ( BUMIP.L ), one of the world\\'s largest thermal coal exporters, is a bitter blow to Rothschild, who staked his reputation on the investment and the model behind it. It also marks the potential end of a miner that has become emblematic of institutional investor concerns over governance at foreign resources firms listed in London. \"The Bakrie family agreed to create Bumi Plc as a way to expand their interests, their reputation,\" one source familiar with the situation said. \"In the end, it\\'s been nothing but trouble.\" Tensions have been rising between Bumi\\'s shareholders, exacerbated last month by an announcement from the London-listed miner that it was launching a probe into potential wrongdoing at its Indonesian coal mining operations, including PT Bumi Resources ( BUMI.JK ), the jewel in the Bakrie crown. It is unclear whether the Bakrie proposal will allow the probe, being led by London lawyers, to proceed. It had been expected to be completed within weeks. \"For the Bakries, they will do anything to defend Bumi Resources,\" said a Bakrie insider who was aware of the proposal. Under the offer, the Bakrie family would cancel their indirect stake in the London-listed group, around 23.8 percent. In exchange, they would get 10.3 percent of PT Bumi Resources, out of a stake of just over 29 percent currently held by the London firm. The Bakries would then buy the remaining 18.9 percent of shares for cash, before Christmas 2012. The Bakries have also made a conditional proposal to buy out Bumi Plc\\'s 84.7 percent stake in PT Berau Coal Energy ( BRAU.JK ), an associated Indonesian coal miner, within the next six months. The news boosted Bumi\\'s volatile shares, after months of steep losses driven by boardroom rows, Bakrie family debts and tumbling coal prices. \"Yes, it is an acknowledgement (of defeat),\" said one source close to the situation, who added it would be difficult for Bumi Plc to work in Indonesia having split from the Bakries. \"No one would want to start from here, but given where we are, this is far from being the worst option.\" END OF THE AFFAIR The Bakries - advised by Ian Hannam, the former JP Morgan banker who masterminded the creation of Bumi Plc two years ago -- outlined a scheme that would leave the London firm without operating assets and back at square one as an investment shell. Bumi Plc\\'s board is now considering the offer and will consult with top investors. \"We are disappointed because there are some absolutely fantastic assets in Indonesia,\" said one top-10 investor in Bumi Plc, lamenting the loss of \"beautifully located\" assets, but pointing to an outcome which could please bruised investors. \"This was a stock that was 150 pence before recent events - the current proposal, if the Bakries have the money to go through with it, would lead to potential return of just under 5 pounds a share according to our calculations,\" he said. \"From out point of view, that is a disappointing outcome, but it is not as catastrophic as it was.\" Bumi Plc\\'s volatile shares were up 41 at 262 pence in afternoon trade after the proposal, still far from peaks of over 12 pounds hit in June last year. Jakarta-listed shares in PT Bumi Resources ended up almost 6 percent. London brokerage Numis said it might be time for the shareholders to cut their losses. \"Valuation aside, this looks like good news for Bumi Plc, in our view, as it could walk away with its reputation intact and some cash in the bank,\" Numis analysts said. \"Losing its main assets would be a disappointment, but given the soggy coal markets and dark cloud surrounding the company, this might be a good way to move on.\" Details on financing arrangements for the Bakries were not disclosed, though a Bakrie spokesman said the London market underestimated the group\\'s financial power, dismissing speculation that the family would not be able to complete the deal - leaving Bumi Plc with Berau, a smaller share in PT Bumi Resources and difficult working conditions in Indonesia. People close to the deal said the Bakries were preparing to borrow up to half the amount required for the deal, possibly through financing arranged by Credit Suisse. Dileep Srivastava, director and corporate secretary for PT Bumi Resources, said the proposal could be a win for all sides. \"We are focused on operational excellence: to reach 100 million metric tonnes (110.23 tons) production in 2014, deleverage and cut interest charges... thereby (unlocking) our intrinsic value - without distractions,\" he said. SINGAPORE MEETING The Bakrie proposal came just before Bumi\\'s board met on Thursday on the 8th floor of Singapore\\'s Mandarin Orchard hotel. This included Rothschild, Indra Bakrie - one of the Bakrie brothers - and Samin Tan, an Indonesian billionaire who pulled the Bakries back from default last year with a $1 billion investment, only to watch the value of his shares crumble. The Bakries and Tan each hold half of a 47.6 percent stake in Bumi Plc, while Rothschild owns 12 percent. The relationship between Rothschild and the Bakries, one of Indonesia\\'s most powerful and politically connected families, has soured since the London group\\'s inception, particularly after a leaked letter from the financier last November that called for a \"radical clean-up\" in PT Bumi Resources. But relations have also frayed between the Bakries and Tan. Sources have said Tan is \"furious\" with the Bakries after watching the value of his investment plunge. There was no immediate word on the Bakrie proposal from Tan. But a source close to the Bakrie family said the deal was a \"clear message of separation with Tan\". The Bakries also urged Rothschild to return shares he received as payment for the successful acquisition of the Bakrie assets, arguing Thursday\\'s proposals reversed that deal. Rothschild, for his part, said he expected the probe into alleged wrongdoing to complete. He pointed to continued challenges for Bumi, including from shareholders still linked to Bakries, after months of struggling to implement \"appropriate standards of corporate governance\".

      "{'text': ' Bentley and Lamborghini\\'s plans to develop ultra-luxury SUVs may be put on hold to save cash for parent Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), company sources said, in a sign that the crisis is beginning to bite even for the German auto giant. \\n U.K.-based Bentley and the Italian supercar maker rolled out extravagant concept sport utility vehicles (SUV) at the auto shows in Geneva and Beijing this year, with production awaiting approval by VW\\'s management board. The push towards off-roaders is aimed at boosting profitability at Lamborghini, loss-making since 2009, and Bentley. The move has dismayed Lamborghini purists who fear that expanding to four-by-fours will dilute the brand\\'s exclusivity. Grappling with unforeseen production cuts and slowing auto sales, VW may postpone the models as it reviews planned spending on equipment, factories and vehicles due to be ratified by VW\\'s supervisory board on November 23, two company sources said. \"Such vehicles are anything but obligatory during a crisis,\" said Frankfurt-based Equinet AG analyst Tim Schuldt. \"Delaying their launch would be no drama but help save costs.\" VW, on course to overtake U.S. rival General Motors ( GM.N ) as the world\\'s second-biggest carmaker behind Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), has outperformed the European market this year. The German company\\'s eight-month EU-wide sales were flat at 2.05 million cars, compared with a 7.1 percent drop to 8.27 million vehicles for the 27-nation region\\'s market. The Wolfsburg-based maker of the Golf hatchback said on Tuesday that sales at its flagship passenger car brand rose just 4.3 percent to 492,500 vehicles in September, the smallest gain in eight months. VW halted production in Germany of its Passat model for two days last week as part of a wider move to cut group output by about 300,000 vehicles to 9.4 million cars this year. That would be up on last year\\'s output of 8.5 million but short of the goal originally set for 2012 of about 9.7 million, company sources said on October 5. Finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch signaled at the Paris auto show that the slump in European demand could spark further austerity measures at VW. \"In this environment, we need to have a considerable amount of liquidity available,\" Poetsch said on September 26. \"It\\'s normal that one looks for items that aren\\'t imperative,\" he added, referring to investments that could potentially be pushed back. Bentley and Lamborghini would be up against stiff new competition with their plush SUVs; Fiat\\'s ( FIA.MI ) Maserati will start production next year of the Jeep-based Kubang, while UK-based Land Rover will launch the new Range Rover Sport in 2014. Ferrari has had a family car, the FF, its biggest model, in its range since last year. The two VW divisions aim to replicate Porsche\\'s success with the Cayenne SUV, which now accounts for half the sports-car maker\\'s deliveries. But exorbitant pricing, fierce competition and a limited pool of buyers in markets such as China may restrain their sales, according to research firm IHS Automotive. IHS said production of the Bentley SUV, scheduled to start in late 2014, might peak at fewer than 4,000 cars in 2016, while the Lamborghini Urus could reach a maximum of fewer than 2,400 in 2018, a year after the model started rolling off the line. \"It\\'ll be tough to turn the models into sustainable business cases,\" Frankfurt-based IHS analyst Henner Lehne said. Bentley could not confirm that its first-ever SUV, code-named EXP 9-F, would be delayed. It will continue to push for the model to get the nod from VW\\'s leadership, spokeswoman Kerstin Sachl said on Wednesday, adding the British carmaker was hoping for a decision by the end of the year. Lamborghini chief executive Stephan Winkelmann told Reuters on September 27 that while VW has yet to sign off on the Urus, the Italian manufacturer would continue with the model\\'s development.

      "{'text': ' Next year offers only a slight improvement for a global economy hit by recession in Europe and slowing or moribund growth in Asia and the United States, according to Reuters polls of hundreds economists worldwide. \\n After reaching 3.1 percent this year, world economic growth is expected to hit 3.4 percent in 2013, polls released on Thursday said - a slight cut from July\\'s poll and slower than the International Monetary Fund\\'s latest forecasts of 3.3 percent and 3.6 percent. While few expected 2012 would be anything other than a difficult year for the world economy, there had earlier been some hope a resilient United States and faster-growing emerging markets would keep up the momentum. This view has changed with economists polled over the last week saying at least some of the weakness will inevitably spill into next year. Much will hinge on whether China, Asia\\'s largest economy, can pull out of its downtrend this year, and if the euro zone can contain its prolonged debt crisis. \"As we\\'ve moved further through 2012, the assumption we\\'ve generally worked off - that next year\\'s got to be better than this - is fading rapidly,\" said Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec in London. She cited a few big risks for next year, including the prospect of deep automatic spending cuts in the United States, the so-called fiscal cliff, which would immediately crimp on growth unless politicians agree a deal to avert it. \"We think they\\'ll find some sort of compromise on that. But there are plenty of smaller drags on global growth through next year - there\\'s no question the euro crisis is going to continue,\" said Clarke. Europe is expected to remain the biggest drag on the world economy next year, as its sovereign debt crisis continues to stew. The predicted five worst performing economies in 2013, out of the 19 covered in the poll, are all European, with Italy bottom of the stack. And the euro zone economy may have to wait until 2014 before it recovers from its decline this year, as few analysts polled by Reuters expect anything other than feeble growth in the quarters ahead. Only 17 of 71 economists polled said it will grow enough next year to cancel out the 0.5 percent decline predicted for 2012. The consensus was for 2013 growth of just 0.3 percent next year, in line with last month\\'s poll. The survey suggested recent aggressive action taken by the European Central Bank will not alone be enough to put the euro zone back on a sound economic footing. Still, easy monetary policy elsewhere in the world should help foster better growth, without really propelling it. NEW YEAR HANGOVER Prospects for the United States, the world\\'s biggest economy, have dimmed only slightly for the first part of next year, suggesting it will maintain its plodding recovery. Economists cut their median growth forecast to an annualized 1.6 percent for the first quarter of 2013, compared with 1.7 percent last month, and to 2.1 percent for the second quarter from 2.3 percent. \"I don\\'t think we are going to get significantly slower from here but that depends on what happens in fiscal policy towards the end of the year,\" said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. The poll showed the vast majority of economists - 29 of 31 -believe politicians will agree to stop January\\'s automatic trigger of $600 billion of tax hikes and spending cuts. That would avoid precipitating what the Congressional Budget Office has warned could be \"a significant recession\" and the loss of about 2 million jobs, a scenario already suffered by some major European economies. Europe\\'s slump has cast a big shadow over export-reliant Asian economies, which will likely register another year of weak growth in 2013. Forecasts for nearly all of the 12 Asian economies polled in October were downgraded from the last quarterly poll conducted in July. \"Next year will probably be quite a difficult year for most Asian economies,\" said Vishnu Varthan, economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank. \"A lot of these economies still have their umbilical cords tied to China and whether China eases policy and its magnitude will probably decide the course of growth in the region.\" China is scheduled to publish third-quarter GDP data next week, with investors anticipating a seventh straight quarter of slowing growth. Still, the likes of India and Indonesia will remain among the world\\'s fastest growing major economies next year.

But analysts quickly saw it as bad news for a nation struggling to compete inside the euro zone. CCH, which has said it fears the Greek crisis could disrupt its multinational business, said in a bourse filing in Athens that shareholders, most of whom are abroad, will exchange their stock for shares in Coca Cola HBC AG, based in Switzerland and effectively shorn of the Greek tag \"Hellenic\". That stock will be primarily quoted on London\\'s LSE. \"A primary listing on Europe\\'s biggest and most liquid stock exchange reflects better the international character of Coca Cola Hellenic\\'s business activities and shareholder base,\" the company said in its regulatory statement. The firm, in which The Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) of the United States has a 23-percent stake, bottles Coke and other produce in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria. About 95 percent of its shareholders and business activity are outside Greece. \"This transaction makes clear business sense,\" chief executive Dimitris Lois told analysts in a conference call. An overwhelming majority of shareholders have already accepted moving a company which has long complained about Greek taxes. Analyst Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities in Athens said that the move made sense for the firm, which follows Greek dairy group FAGE this month in seeking a low-tax, low-volatility haven for its corporate base - in FAGE\\'s case Luxembourg. \"The Greek bourse is losing a very good company and the London Stock Exchange is gaining a very important group,\" said Hatzidakis. \"It\\'s very bad news for the Greek economy and bourse.\" For brokers on the stock exchange, losing a stock that made up 8 percent of daily turnover this year will be unwelcome - especially since total volumes are down by half since last year. For the Greek treasury, the loss of tax revenue is unclear. Though CCH officials did not detail tax savings from moving the registered office to Switzerland, it has complained of high - and increasingly unpredictable - taxation in crisis-hit Athens. But the move may further discourage investment in Greece. Trade unionists saw the corporate exodus as immoral and one, Stathis Anestis, spokesman for the biggest labor group GSEE, suggested a boycott of Coke : \"This is unacceptable,\" he said. \"CCH and FAGE are speculating at the most crucial moment for the Greek economy and the Greek people. Consumers should use their power to punish these companies.\" COUNTRY RISK One analyst said CCH, which rose to the top of corporate rankings as the values of Greek banks collapsed, was out to rid its share price of such risks associated with Greece; the country is mired in recession and facing mass discontent as its leaders slash budgets to meet international creditors\\' terms for loans intended to keep Athens inside Europe\\'s single currency. \"This is a healthy company that does not want to suffer from Greece\\'s high country risk,\" said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign investors have been steadily reducing their investment in the Athens Stock Exchange  .ATG  since the country was engulfed by the sovereign debt crisis in 2009. Greece\\'s future in the 17-nation euro zone still remains in doubt. Aided by the fact that it is doing most of its business outside Greece, CCH consistently outperformed the general Athens stock market index, which has slumped to 20-year lows. CCH has become the country\\'s biggest firm by market value with a capitalization of around 6 billion euros ($7.7 billion), representing about a fifth of the Athens bourse\\'s total. The company, which last year made net profit of 330 million euros on sales of 6.85 billion, has complained of taxes imposed under Greek government austerity measures. A U.S. filing shows it paid about 20 million euros in both 2009 and 2010 for one-off \"social responsibility\" levies in Greece. Profits at operating units in other countries are generally taxed locally. The Greek parent company reported 32 million euros in Greek taxes in 2010 and none last year. New withholding tax on dividends in Greece might have affected CCH in future. In its U.S. filing for 2011, the company said: \"Greece, which accounted for approximately 6 percent of our unit case sales volume and approximately 8 percent of our net sales revenue in 2011, is currently facing a severe economic crisis resulting from significant government fiscal deficits and high levels of government borrowing.\" \"The ... Greek government debt crisis may have impacts on our liquidity that currently cannot be predicted.\" CCH said it would delist from the Athens Stock Exchange and then seek to re-enter that bourse with a secondary listing. Coca Cola Hellenic shares closed down 4.9 percent at 15.66 euros in Athens. Analysts explained the drop by the low cash price of 13.58 euros the company is offering to those shareholders who refuse the offer of new Swiss shares.

      "{'text': ' Activist investor Carl Icahn offered to buy all the outstanding shares of Oshkosh Corp ( OSK.N ) Thursday for a 21-percent premium to the U.S. truckmaker\\'s closing price on Wednesday, sending its shares to their highest in more than a year. \\n Icahn, the company\\'s largest shareholder with a 9.45 percent stake, said the only condition on his $32.50-a-share offer was that shareholders elect a slate of directors whom he will nominate to the company\\'s board. \"Mismanagement of this company has resulted in a lost decade of shareholder value,\" Icahn said in a statement. \"Oshkosh needs proactive shareholders to bring a proactive management team together to weather a volatile economy.\" Oshkosh said its board would advise shareholders of its position on the offer within 10 business days, and suggested that shareholders not act on the offer until the board has reviewed it. Oshkosh shareholders had, in January, voted down an Icahn-backed slate of directors. Shares of the company surged 12 percent to $29.98 on the news, earlier hitting $31.30, their highest since July 2011. \"It\\'s not an unattractive price by any means, but it\\'s surely not a fully valued price,\" said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst who covers Oshkosh at Longbow Research. Lustgarten has a \"buy\" rating on Oshkosh with a $34 target price. Profit at the Oshkosh, Wisconsin-based company slumped about 36 percent through the first nine months of its recently ended fiscal year, hurt by declines at its military-vehicle unit. Last month, Oshkosh management met with analysts and laid out a plan to double annual profit by 2015, helped by cost costs and strong growth at its JLG aerial-lift arm. In August, Icahn told Reuters he believed Oshkosh should spin off JLG, which it acquired in 2006 for $3 billion. NAVISTAR RISES Oshkosh is not Icahn\\'s only big holding in the U.S. trucking sector. He is also the third-largest shareholder of Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ), with a 14.94 percent stake. Icahn proposed merging the two companies last year, a move supported by former Navistar Chief Executive Daniel, but opposed by Oshkosh. Navistar shares rose 6 percent to $23.34. \"People are thinking that with Icahn involved in both, there\\'s an opportunity to put them together and generate some shareholder value,\" said David Leiker, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co who covers Navistar. Leiker said he didn\\'t see a lot of sense in combining the two companies. While both make military trucks, they assemble them in different ways, he said, adding, \"It\\'s like bicycles and cars.\" A spokeswoman for Navistar, which in late August replaced Ustian with former Textron Inc ( TXT.N ) CEO Lewis Campbell, declined to comment. Last week, Icahn was victorious in his campaign at Navistar when the maker of International-brand trucks agreed to accept Icahn associate, Vincent Intrieri, to its board. The company also agreed to accept another shareholder, Mark Rachesky, as a director and to take on one other director nominated by the two investors. SHAREHOLDER VOTE Oshkosh shareholders\\' rejection in January of Icahn\\'s director nominees has not deterred the billionaire, who is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management shake-ups or sales. Icahn urged Oshkosh in August to spin off its JLG aerial-lift unit to shareholders, saying that business, which Oshkosh bought in 2006 for $3 billion, would do better on its own. In a statement Thursday, he said that, once officially made, his tender offer would expire in 45 days, but that if at least 25 percent of the company\\'s outstanding shares were sold to him, he would extend it. Should he be able to boost his stake to 50.1 percent, Icahn added, \"we will demand that the current board ... accelerate the upcoming annual meeting to allow the prompt election of our slate of directors so that the tender offer can close quickly.\" Oshkosh shares have risen some 52 percent over the past year, while Navistar\\'s have declined 39 percent. The broad Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index  .SPX  has risen 10 percent.

      "{'text': ' Japanese wireless service provider Softbank Corp is looking to buy roughly 70 percent of Sprint Nextel Corp in a bold move that would make it a major player in the U.S. mobile market. \\n But Softbank\\'s ambitions may not stop with Sprint, which might also be looking to buy out its partner, Clearwire Corp. The Japanese company might also be aiming to use Sprint as a vehicle to make a run at smaller Sprint peer MetroPCS Communications Inc, a two-step transaction that would potentially cost more than 2 trillion yen ($25.55 billion), according to a Nikkei report. That would make it the biggest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company ever and vault Softbank into the upper echelons of wireless carriers worldwide. In response to reports of a pending deal, Sprint said on Thursday that it was in talks with Softbank on a \"potential substantial investment\" that could involve a change in control of the U.S. company. It said there was no assurance of a sale. Softbank is eyeing a controlling stake in Sprint worth more than 1 trillion yen ($12.8 billion) and is in talks with several banks to borrow money to finance a bid, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. A second source familiar with the situation, who would not speak on the matter publicly, said Softbank was after a stake of roughly 70 percent, which it could achieve by buying some newly issued shares directly from Sprint and tendering for the rest. By raising some new equity directly, Sprint would be able to shore up its balance sheet and potentially fund other deals such as a buyout of Clearwire in which it already holds roughly 48 percent. Sprint shares rose as much as 19 percent on Thursday to levels not seen since the summer of 2011, on the heaviest trading volume in the stock\\'s history. The stock ultimately closed 14.3 percent higher at $5.76 on New York Stock Exchange. The shares of Clearwire, which could play a key role in any deal, closed almost 71 percent higher at $2.22. Clearwire, which has been looking for new sources of funding, has said that it has enough money until at least the middle of 2013. It declined to comment on Thursday and its chief financial officer pulled out of a conference presentation at the last minute without an explanation. A major Sprint investor said any Softbank investment should be used to buy out the rest of Clearwire, to give Sprint attractive wireless spectrum assets and to speed up Clearwire\\'s upgrade of its wireless network with faster data speeds. \"I just don\\'t think there\\'s any deal unless it involves Clearwire. I don\\'t think you\\'d see one without the other,\" said Daniel Martino, a fund manager at T. Rowe Price, which owned 47.2 million Sprint shares as of the end of June. DEALS MULTIPLYING Sprint, whose market capitalization was $15.12 billion at Wednesday\\'s market close, is the third-largest U.S. carrier, with more than 56 million users at the end of June, even after losing customers for years. As for Softbank, Sprint might be its only option for an entrance into the U.S. market, according to analysts. \"In terms of (Sprint) standalone, we believe the asset represents the only way for a potential new entrant to get a national presence immediately in the U.S.,\" Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a note to clients. The Softbank news comes just days after a source told Reuters that Sprint has been considering bidding for MetroPCS, which agreed this month to merge with Deutsche Telekom AG\\'s and NTT Docomo. Japanese media said buying Sprint - which competes in the United States against Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc - would also make it cheaper for Softbank to procure smartphones and other mobile devices. Benjamin Powell, a former general counsel to the director of national intelligence now in private practice at WilmerHale, said the deal was very likely to require a government review because it involved sensitive telecommunications networks. But several analysts said regulators were likely to eventually look favorably on a deal. Japanese companies made a record 642 cross-border deals last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Buoyed by a stronger yen, the value of all overseas deals rose to $69.5 billion, up 81 percent from 2010, also a record.

U.S. sales account for nearly half of BAE\\'s revenue. \"We are obviously disappointed that we were unable to reach an acceptable agreement with our various government stakeholders,\" BAE Chief Executive Ian King said of the failed deal to merge with European Airbus manufacturer EADS that would have created the world\\'s biggest aerospace and defense group. \"However, our business remains strong and financially robust. We continue to see opportunities across our platforms and services offerings and in the various international markets in which we operate.\" Talking to reporters on Wednesday, King had played up the company\\'s opportunities outside the United States and Britain, naming Saudi Arabia and Oman as two areas of growth.

      "{'text': ' BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) moved to patch up damaged relations with its investors on Thursday, promising imminent meetings to discuss its strategy after the failure of its attempted merger with EADS ( EAD.PA ), shareholders told Reuters on Thursday. \\n Investors are keen to hear management make its case and explain how Europe\\'s biggest defense contractor plans to keep growing when governments are cutting back on their military spending. \"We want to sit down with the company to talk through exactly why they wanted to do this deal, and now that it won\\'t be going ahead, what are the plans,\" said one of BAE\\'s top 20 shareholders. \"They implied this was a strategic necessity, and now they say this setback is fine and that they can carry on as normal. Well, which is it?\" Investors contacted by Reuters after the proposed deal fell through said BAE\\'s management has said it will meet them, possibly within days, to outline its plans. Earlier this week fund manager Invesco, BAE\\'s biggest shareholder with more than 13 percent of the company, fired a broadside at the company in an attempt to sink the merger, citing concerns over state interference, poor terms and lack of strategic rationale. But now the deal is off the table many of the investors said they remained supportive of BAE\\'s managers but still expect to see a robust plan for the company\\'s future, and will not settle for pledges to find an alternative suitor, perhaps in the United States as a solution to its immediate challenges. \"They need to be clear now. The last thing you want to hear is they\\'re just going to wait for a better suitor to come over the hill. You want them to be actively managing the business and getting on with the day-to-day business of winning more international contracts,\" said another leading shareholder. A number of investors said management were owed a modest amount of credit for engaging EADS ( EAD.PA ) in what they saw as an ambitious attempt to fulfill obligations to investors and explore all possible ways of generating value for shareholders. One major shareholder said he had supported the principle of the merger with the owner of Airbus as an effective way to meet BAE\\'s challenge of diversifying away from its current dependence on the weakening defense sector. The failure of the deal is therefore an ominous sign for the company, he noted. \"BAE are left in a tricky position ... Consolidation would seem sensible in the face of such difficulties, but as we have seen, this is not going to be easy to achieve,\" he said. None of the investors contacted by Reuters demanded an immediate management overhaul following the deal\\'s collapse but indicated that Chief Executive Ian King and Chairman Dick Olver face a tough few weeks in trying to restore their credibility and avoid a vote of no confidence at the next shareholder meeting. \"Until you sit down with the company, you cannot make those kinds of judgments on whether the chairman should stay or go ... So we\\'ll hold fire, talk to the company and then decide how we feel about it,\" the first investor said.

But the European Commission, the EU\\'s executive, said Washington has shown no proof it has complied. \"It is now clear for the European Union that the United States has not only failed to properly implement the decision of the WTO but it has even provided new subsidies to Boeing,\" the Commission said in a statement.

      "{'text': ' The collapse of the proposed merger between BAE Systems Plc and EADS will shift the focus to smaller deals among global weapons makers as companies strive to keep revenue rising in the face of cuts in military spending by the United States and Europe. \\n Industry executives and bankers do not see other mega-deals on the horizon for now, after the $45 billion UK-French-German talks collapsed on Wednesday. The failure showed how easily a deal of that scale can be derailed by competing interests of different countries, despite commercial logic. Instead, major defense companies likely will focus on possible combinations with smaller players such as Rockwell Collins, L-3 Communications Holdings Inc, SAIC Inc, ITT Exelis and Harris Corp, according to interviews with more than a dozen industry executives and bankers. \"None of the big players in the global defense industry seem inclined to do mega-mergers similar to the BAE-EADS proposal,\" said Loren Thompson, a Washington-based defense consultant who has advised BAE\\'s U.S. unit and its competitors. \"The American companies are all at a place where they\\'re not eager to grow in defense and are basically trying to secure their base, while the overseas companies have been chastened in watching the BAE-EADS transaction falter.\" It is also unlikely that big U.S. prime defense contractors would bid for BAE Systems, even though the company is considered potentially \"in play\" after the failed merger, because of the potential complexity, these people said. EADS said it would continue its aggressive hunt for takeover targets and alliances, especially with U.S. partners, though on a smaller scale than the BAE deal. EADS North America Chief Executive Sean O\\'Keefe said on Wednesday that EADS remained \"undeterred\" in its drive to increase its share of the U.S. defense market. BAE\\'s U.S. unit said it, too, would keep looking for possible mergers in the areas of cyber, intelligence, security, electronics and international businesses. The scope of consolidation in the defense industry still hinges largely on how the U.S. Congress deals with $1.2 billion in mandatory budget cuts slated to start in 2013. Half of those cuts are for defense, and as long as those reductions threaten, mergers and acquisitions are expected to remain slow. Worldwide aerospace and defense deals have totaled $5 billion so far in 2012, compared with $27.5 billion in all of 2011, when United Technology\\'s $16.5 billion takeover of Goodrich boosted the total. This year\\'s total also appears low compared with $6.7 billion in deals in 2010. The effort by BAE and EADS to create the world\\'s biggest aerospace and defense group underscored the effect of shrinking markets on big weapons makers. Many other major companies are scrambling to move into adjacent civilian or commercial markets, or find smaller takeover targets to keep revenues growing, bankers and senior industry executives said. \"Second-tier consolidation is much easier because the Defense Department is not against it,\" said a banker who requested anonymity, because he is not authorized to speak to the media. \"Had the EADS-BAE deal gone through and created a stronger global entity, clearly it would have increased the likelihood of U.S. consolidation at the prime level,\" said the banker. \"The chances seem lower in the absence of the deal.\" The U.S. Department of Defense has discouraged mergers among the leading U.S. prime contractors, but has said it is fully expecting takeovers, mergers and other actions among second- and third-tier suppliers, given the expected decline in defense spending in coming years. A Pentagon official said last month that the department would have to rethink its views on top-tier mergers if Congress is unable to avert another $500 billion massive military spending cuts on top of the $487 billion in cuts already slated for the next decade. NEW BAE DANCE PARTNER? Almost all prime U.S. defense contractors considered merging with BAE Systems at various points in the past, and decided against it, several people familiar with the companies\\' thinking said. Most were interested in BAE\\'s North American operations and they remain wary of adding political risk that would come with being the UK government\\'s prime contractor by pursuing the whole company, they said. \"There had been conversations for decades,\" said a senior industry adviser on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media. \"But buying the whole BAE, with golden share and other things like dual-listing, dual-incorporation structure, U.S. guys say it\\'s not worth it.\" For its part, BAE Systems has repeatedly said it has no intention of selling the U.S. unit, which contributes more than half of the company\\'s revenue. BAE officials made clear in recent weeks that any move by the U.S. government to require divestitures as a condition for approving a merger with EADS would have been a deal-breaker. Some sources cautioned that a new round of merger considerations involving BAE cannot be ruled out, given the challenging defense environment. But most potential U.S. bidders have their own reasons for why the deal would not make sense right now. Executives at Lockheed Martin Corp have said privately that they have no plans to pursue BAE, which is a key supplier on its troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. They say the company is squarely focused on its performance on the F-35, the Pentagon\\'s largest weapons program, and does not need the distraction of integrating a major acquisition. Boeing Co is more focused on its booming commercial business and expanding its position in the cyber and unmanned systems areas at the moment, according to company executives and analysts. Raytheon Co\\'s Chief Executive William Swanson has publicly discussed the immense challenges involved in absorbing such a large, complex company. Northrop Grumman Corp just sold two units, including its lackluster shipbuilding business, to streamline the company, making an acquisition highly unlikely, according to company insiders. Chief Executive Wes Bush is more focused on creating a high-performing defense company and maintaining profit margins, not acquiring a company whose revenues have been hard hit by the downturn in demand for ground combat vehicles, according to analysts and company executives. Any combination with General Dynamics Corp could raise antitrust issues, since the General Dynamics and BAE both build the biggest U.S. combat vehicles, and on a global scale, submarines. General Dynamics also is changing management, with Phebe Novakovic slated to take over as chief executive in January. The company has highlighted the importance of its balanced portfolio of commercial and military businesses, and may be reluctant to add more defense activities to its portfolio at a time when military spending is declining, analysts said. Pentagon officials were open to a possible merger of BAE and EADS because it would have created a stronger, sixth prime competitor. But the agency could be more wary of a deal that involved a combination with one of the existing primes, some industry executives said.

      "{'text': ' Two of the world\\'s top commodity exchange powerhouses are scrambling to turn new regulations to their advantage in an important but largely hidden piece of their business, the trading and clearing of energy swaps. \\n Chicago-based giant CME Group Inc. ( CME.O ) has lost ground in the estimated $1.2 billion-a-year business of guaranteeing over-the-counter swaps to arch-rival IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) in recent years, company data show, as the Atlanta-based upstart offered cutting-edge trade technology. Both companies are now racing to carve a new advantage by recasting many, if not most, cleared energy swaps as futures -- thereby making them exempt from new Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules due to come into effect on October 12. Some of those rules may now be delayed, Bloomberg reported. The switch to futures is in large part semantic: In most key respects, the newly renamed oil, natural gas or electricity futures contracts are almost identical to the swaps that companies like BP ( BP.L ) or Glencore ( GLEN.L ) have been routinely using to hedge for a decade. But for the energy industry, where clearing has been a mainstay ever since the Enron meltdown over a decade ago, the benefit of switching to futures is huge. Under the CFTC\\'s new swaps rules, many could face much stricter regulatory requirements, including putting up more capital, if they trade more than $8 billion a year of swaps. Whichever exchange offers the smoothest transition and greatest regulatory security stands to win more volume. For both ICE and CME, the stakes are substantial. Over-the-counter energy clearing generated about $400 million or 30 percent of ICE\\'s total revenue last year, and about $300 million, or 9 percent of the CME\\'s. CME does not break out revenue from clearing other kinds of swaps. And even though energy clearing is a smaller piece of the CME\\'s pie, analysts say there is greater pressure on the CME to get it right in the battle for market share, one that is fuelling the biggest energy upheaval in a decade. Although the regulatory uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook amid questions over what exactly will be counted as a swap, the CME \"might not be as well positioned as ICE\" for the coming era, says KBW analyst Niamh Alexander. For at least the past three and a half years -- as far back as CME data is available -- ICE has dominated the business, with volume doubling even as CME\\'s activity has slipped. Last year ICE handled nearly four times the energy swaps contracts as CME; so far this year ICE\\'s volume is running at five times that at CME. ENERGY SWAPS IN CROSSFIRE The change is part of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms meant to drive the over-the-counter derivatives market -- blamed in part for exacerbating the 2007-2008 financial crisis -- into the safety of clearinghouses, which guarantee the trades. In broad terms the shift means money for clearinghouses, with vast parts of the interest rate and credit swap trading currently done bilaterally over-the-counter. Clearing revenue could reach about $2.1 billion by 2014, says Alexander. There is less growth for energy swaps, which have been predominantly traded on a centrally cleared basis for years. Regulators, for their part, say they are merely trying to create a safer world. \"I could care less about any competitive issues between CME and ICE, but I want to ensure that our rules don\\'t roil the markets,\" CFTC commissioner Bart Chilton told reporters this week in Chicago. In a swap, the trader on one side of the contract agrees to periodically pay a fixed price for, say, a barrel of oil, and the trader on the other side agrees to pay whatever price the market currently bears. Like an exchange-traded futures contract, which is a deal to buy or sell a set amount of a commodity at a future date, a swap lets traders lock in prices or bet on price swings. But swaps have historically been traded away from exchanges and were not as heavily policed -- until now. DIFFERING ROOTS ICE and CME grew out of very different parts of the energy market. ICE, founded in 2000 by big Wall Street banks, energy companies and electricity merchants, was a power and gas trading platform, while the New York Mercantile Exchange and Clearport, acquired by CME in 2008, had its deepest roots in oil. Ever since the late 2001 collapse of power-trading giant Enron drove most energy swaps users to seek the safety of clearing, both have grown. The 2008 financial crisis that forced companies to reassess the creditworthiness of the biggest traders gave another boost to clearing activity, years before new rules would make such centralized risk mandatory. But over the years, offerings by the CME and ICE have increasingly overlapped for both on-exchange futures -- including ICE\\'s successful U.S. crude contract that mimics the Nymex benchmark -- and clearing for off-exchange swaps. CME and ICE compete most heavily in natural gas swaps, which make up about 57 percent of energy swaps cleared on CME\\'s Clearport and 81 percent of OTC energy volume at ICE, according to data from the exchanges. Clearport, CME\\'s energy clearing platform, also does a brisk business in oil swaps, which account for about 23 percent of the total, while ICE\\'s second-biggest market is for power swaps, comprising 16 percent of ICE\\'s swaps business, the data show. \"I\\'d say they\\'re competing head to head on clearing now,\" says Chris Thorpe, executive director of energy derivatives at broker INTL FC Stone. \"The ICE technology and back-end systems seem to be better, and ICE has always had more competitive fees.\" ICE seems to be pulling further ahead this year. ICE cleared about 2 million OTC energy contracts a day in the first six months of the year, up 25 percent from its 2011 average and double 2009, according to its filings. CME handled 440,000 contracts a day this year through August, about the same as last year and down about 10 percent from 2009. VOILA -- FUTURES! ICE has set out a relatively straightforward response to the regulatory changes: Over this coming weekend, it will convert all of its cleared energy swaps to futures. CFTC approved the move this week, and allowed it to keep the same margin offsets, which save money for traders, it had when the contracts were swaps. It is a simple transition for ICE, since its most liquid cleared swaps are already traded on its electronic platform. \"ICE\\'s transition from swaps to futures ensures that markets remain transparent and liquid because they already trade competitively and transparently,\" an ICE spokeswoman told Reuters. A CME spokesman declined to comment on liquidity, but said the exchange is \"ready to go,\" pending regulatory approval for some its own rules to ease the transition to futures. The CME has a more complex path, and will institute a series of rules that will make it easier for traders to replace swaps with futures but retain the benefits of off-exchange deals. Clearport contracts start life as swaps, and are converted to futures at clearing. Under a new rule filed late last month, CME will allow users to enter into the very same contracts away from the exchange -- a key feature of over-the-counter swaps -- but they will be designated as futures from the get-go. The problem for CME, however, is that it does not currently have a liquid trading platform for many of its Clearport contracts, making the transition to futures a bit more rocky. Until early next year, Clearport swaps will not count toward the $8 billion threshold that marks a large swap trader, a CFTC advisory showed this week, giving CME a few months to bring its trading platform up to speed.

      "{'text': ' The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits slid last week to the lowest level in more than four and a half years, according to government data that may provide a boost to President Barack Obama a month before voters go to the polls. \\n The Labor Department report on Thursday was the latest data to suggest improvement in the jobs market, though the surprisingly large 30,000 drop in new claims may have reflected distortions due to seasonal adjustments that are likely to be smoothed out in coming weeks. \"The overall trend seems to be that the labor market is improving,\" said Brian Kim, a currency strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. A Labor Department analyst said seasonal factors had predicted a very large increase in claims last week, which he said would be typical for the first week of the quarter. Unadjusted claims did rise, but far less than expected, resulting in the sharp drop in the seasonally adjusted figure. He noted that one state reported a decline in claims last week when a rise had been expected. No states had been estimated for the report, he said. \"We will likely see some payback in the claims data reported next week. But through this potential volatility, it does look like the trend in the claims is improving somewhat,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan. California, given its large population and past \"massive swings\" in its claims data, was probably the state that caused the sharp drop in the seasonally adjusted figure, Silver said. A second Labor Department official said \"a processing issue\" resulted in the state, which he did not identify, reporting fewer claims than expected. \"We cannot dictate to a state how they process their claims ... This is one of the years they happened to be behind everyone else,\" he said, adding the Columbus Day holiday this week may have been one factor. \"This individual state, whenever there are increases in claim, usually range from 15,000 to almost 20,000,\" he added. The jobs data was tempered by a second report on Thursday that hinted at weaker U.S. and global demand. The trade deficit widened in August to $44.2 billion, as goods exports fell for the fifth consecutive month and imports declined fractionally. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, the lowest number of new claims since February 2008, about a year before Obama took office in the midst of the global financial crisis. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims edging up to 370,0000 last week. Zach Pandl, strategist at Columbia Management in Minneapolis, said \"you do have to be cautious about possible distortions. But with that caveat, the jobless claims numbers have been modestly encouraging over the last few weeks.\" The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, fell 11,500 to 364,000, the lowest in six months. U.S. stocks rose in response to the jobs data, while Treasury debt prices slipped and the dollar was lower against a basket of currencies. A government report on Friday showed employers added a modest 114,000 jobs to payrolls in September but the unemployment rate dropped sharply to 7.8 percent, also the lowest level since Obama took office. Former General Electric chief executive Jack Welch and others suggested last week the payrolls data was fixed to make Obama look better ahead of the election, a charge the Labor Department strongly denied. Obama\\'s opponent, Republican Mitt Romney, has accused the president of mishandling the economy. Thursday\\'s claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid fell to 3.27 million in the week ended September 29, the latest data available. It was the lowest since May. DECLINING TRADE A Reuters poll on Thursday showed economists were slightly less optimistic about U.S. growth, lowering their median growth forecasts to an annualized 1.6 percent for the first quarter of 2013, compared to 1.7 percent last month. The group of more than 70 respondents also trimmed their second-quarter forecasts to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent, suggesting the U.S. economy will continue its slow, steady plod despite a recession in Europe, a slowdown in China and more restrictive fiscal policy at home. The monthly trade deficit increased to $44.2 billion in August, from an upwardly revised estimate of $42.5 billion in July, the Commerce Department said. Analysts were expecting an August trade gap of about $44.0 billion. Overall U.S. exports dropped 1.0 percent as troubles in Europe continue to weigh on global growth, while imports fell 0.1 percent in a sign of faltering U.S. demand for consumer products, autos and capital goods. \"It looks like net exports will contribute negatively to GDP (gross domestic product) growth, subtracting as much as half a percentage point,\" said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York. A separate Labor Department report showed that overall U.S. import prices rose 1.1 percent for the second consecutive month in September, while U.S. export prices rose 0.8 percent.

      "{'text': ' European banks will need at least another five years to bolster their capital base in line with new regulations, as they wait for loan books to slowly expire rather than sell them at a loss, a report said on Thursday. \\n The resultant protracted shortage of credit for firms and individuals risks starving investment and spending and, in turn, hinder the economic recovery, according to a Deloitte survey of banks representing 11 trillion euros ($14.19 trillion) in assets. Banks need to reduce loan portfolios and trading positions to comply with regulators\\' demands to put up more of their own money for every dollar they lend. Almost three quarters of respondents to the Deloitte survey said that reducing balance sheet debt is likely to take more than five years - longer than previous banking crises. The IMF expects banks to reduce their balance sheets at a faster pace than suggested by Deloitte. October\\'s Global Financial Stability Report said European banks are likely to offload $2.8 trillion in assets over two years, or over 7 percent of total assets. But Deloitte\\'s report found the process - known as deleveraging - will be \"surprisingly modest\", involving less than 7.5 percent of total assets over five years. \"While the numbers involved are large in nominal terms, this is a relatively small compared with the expansion of credit in the boom years,\" said Margaret Doyle, head of Financial Services Research at Deloitte. Less than half of the 18 banks in the survey believe that selling off assets will play an important part in bringing down how much debt they hold. Finding a buyer was the biggest problem for nearly 60 percent of respondents. The fragile state of the European economy, meanwhile, has barricaded other avenues to higher capital levels, such as ploughing back earnings or asking investors for more money. Banks will be particularly reluctant to divest assets if they expect this to worsen their capital position, and more than 5 percent of respondents expect deleveraging to have a negative impact on their bank\\'s Core Tier 1 ratio. While a rapid deleveraging process might require banks to take big losses on assets, the Deloitte report said a very slow deleveraging can raise questions about whether the assets remain overvalued following a credit boom. \"The uncertainty can slow economic recovery,\" the report said. \"This adjustment path may feel less painful in the short run, but at the price of a slower economic recovery.\" (Editing by  Douwe Miedema  and Hans-Juergen Peters)', 'date': ' Thu Oct 11, 2012 6:32am EDT\\n', 'title': ' European banks drag heels on loan sales: survey\\n', 'author': ' By Dasha Afanasieva\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-banks-europe-debt-idUSBRE89A0JF20121011\\n\\n \\n\\n LONDON  ('}\n",

Italy\\'s Finmeccanica, meanwhile, has been presented with various opportunities to take advantage of the merger\\'s failure, Giampaolo Di Paola told reporters at the margins of a parliamentary hearing. The defense minister said that these have to be evaluated first by management and then by the government, adding: \"I would like to see these evaluations carried out very rapidly.\" Di Paola\\'s comments, which came ahead of a meeting between Finmeccanica and the government to discuss possible alliance prospects, boosted shares in the state-owned conglomerate to their highest level in seven months. An industry source familiar with the situation said that Finmeccanica, Europe\\'s third-biggest defense group, could take part in any cross-border talks for possible alliances in aeronautics, defense electronics and helicopters. The company, which posted a 2.3 billion euro ($2.97 billion)loss last year, would have greater bargaining power in sector consolidation talks if it manages to make progress in its continuing restructuring and asset disposal plan, the source added. Chairman Giuseppe Orsi and other Finmeccanica executives are expected to meet Prime Minister Mario Monti, Di Paola and Treasury Minister Vittorio Grilli on October 16 to talk about the prospect of alliances and development in the aeronautics and defense sectors. Finmeccanica, Italy\\'s No. 2 industrial group behind car maker Fiat ( FIA.MI ), has put on the block its non-core energy and transportation assets and has promised to earn 1 billion euros from disposals by the end of the year to avoid its credit rating being cut to \"junk\". The industry source said that Finmeccanica\\'s experience in building the Eurofighter could make it easier for the group to join any European or international partnership for the next generation of fighter aircraft, which could either be a drone or a more traditional fighter plane. Although its Anglo-Italian AgustaWestland helicopter business is profit-making, Finmeccanica needs to cut costs and restructure its aeronautics and defense electronics operations - sectors in which greater international cooperation is needed because of shrinking budgets. Analysts have said that Finmeccanica could expand cooperation or even consider a merger with French aerospace and defense electronics specialist Thales ( TCFP.PA ).

      "{'text': ' As Greece\\'s privatization program resumes this month, nearly half a year behind schedule, at stake is not just the billions of euros it needs to raise, but the credibility of its commitment to reforms demanded by its creditors. \\n Greek politicians are under intense pressure at home to resist foreign calls to sell state assets on the cheap and raise fast cash to pay down government debt. More challenging still will be efforts to use privatization as a tool to uproot corrupt business practices and restore foreign investors\\' confidence in Greece. The 15-month-old Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund aims to transform dozens of state businesses to increase value before leasing or selling them through a series of tenders. The first major sales - gambling company OPAP, state gas business DEPA and several prime real estate projects - could be completed as early as the first quarter of 2013, putting the fund back on track after wildly missing a 3 billion euro target this year. It now expects to generate just 300 million in 2012. Many hope privatization proceeds will help break the cycle of austerity and recession in Greece, where economic output has declined by almost a quarter since 2008 and unemployment is nearing 25 percent. Greece, the most indebted euro zone nation relative to GDP, has repeatedly missed targets set under its EU/IMF bailouts and risks being forced out of the single currency. If successfully executed, economists say the privatizations could add an annual 3.5 percent to GDP from 2013, enough to return Greece to growth, and create 150,000 long-term jobs. A leading fund official said the delays had been largely down to the need to get companies in a state to sell. \"As the interest for Greece is waning, you can\\'t proceed with tenders where the assets are not 100 percent clean and attractive,\" the official said on condition of anonymity. \"We\\'re having a deep dive in all the companies to single out all the major issues the companies have, to deliver them to the market,\" he said. WOOING FOREIGN INVESTMENT To create greater transparency and attract foreign investors, the fund was set up in July 2011 as an independent agency, with English as its official language. Its core task is raising 19 billion euros by 2015, but more important will be how Greece is perceived by international markets to be meeting criteria for its 173 billion euro bailout. \"It is absolutely critical we send a signal of change,\" the top official said. The privatization fund got off to a rocky start, with repeat general elections in May and June having stalled activity by more than five months. Its first head, Costas Mitropoulos, quit less than a year into the job, citing a lack of political will. \"The newly elected government has not given ... the necessary level of support,\" he wrote in a July resignation letter. \"On the contrary, in an indirect but systematic manner, the government has acted to undermine the authority and credibility of the fund.\" A high-level Greek official speaking on condition of anonymity said the current privatization target, down from an initial 50 billion euros, is still unrealistic because \"the credibility of Greece is at a low\". Investors are more interested in high-yield government bonds than sinking money into 30-year infrastructure projects with uncertain outcomes, the official said, citing conversations with major U.S. fund managers. WINDS OF CHANGE There are signs business practices are changing for the better in a country one official jokingly called \"the last Soviet-style economy in Europe\". An example came early this year, according to a person who was present, when Russian oil executive and former energy minister Igor Yusufov offered 250 million euros in cash to buy the Greek gas network in a meeting at the fund\\'s Athens office. Yusufov confirmed attending a meeting at the privatization fund\\'s office in April but denied proposing - in writing or verbally - to buy the network for 250 million euros in cash saying that this was not his intention. Yusufov\\'s investment vehicle, Fund Energy, was dropped from the tender process for DEPA, the public gas corporation 14 companies are now bidding for, which is expected to fetch more than four times that amount. According to one source familiar with the discussions, the question of price was not raised by anyone because, under the terms of the tender, bidders would only put forward price proposals at the next stage of the process. Fund Energy complained at the time that its exclusion from the tender process was \"unlawful\", and says it is still interested in energy assets in Greece. \"We continue to be interested in energy assets in Greece and await the announcement by the government of new terms for the process of privatizing the country\\'s energy assets,\" Yusufov said on Thursday. The privatization program requires a raft of bureaucratic reforms. At least 77 technical regulations, government decrees and ministerial guidelines must pass through Greece\\'s notoriously slow legislature, including the creation of new market regulators. In September, the first small deal was reached when the fund said it would raise at least 81 million euros from the long-term lease of a shopping mall that once housed the broadcast center for the Athens 2004 Olympics. Next month, the sale of the highly profitable State Lotteries operator is expected, followed by the state\\'s remaining 33 percent in football betting monopoly OPAP and a controlling stake in DEPA. Other businesses and properties slated for privatization are regional ports, airports and a multi-billion-euro, top seaside property at the site of the former Athens airport of Hellenikon. \"The finance minister and the prime minister are very keen to show the Europeans things are moving ahead, and a key priority is to show privatization is being accomplished,\" said Wolfango Piccoli of Eurasia, the political risk consultancy. \"It\\'s a huge priority for the government.

      "{'text': ' Its $45 billion merger plan shot down, BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) must now hunt growth elsewhere if the British arms maker is to find the cash needed to sustain big dividends and avert the possibility of a break-up. \\n CEO Ian King is under pressure to spur the search for new business with a lucrative deal in Saudi Arabia now seen as crucial to bolster the balance sheet. The warning signs for the maker of Astute nuclear submarines and Challenger tanks are clear. Net debt at Europe\\'s biggest arms maker is mounting, and there are ominous signs from the massive U.S. defense market that has powered recent revenues. The fact it considered a merger with Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ), a company in which it sold a stake in 2006 having balked at a full merger several years earlier, showed how wide-ranging BAE\\'s search for a new strategy has become. \"The genie is out of the bottle now and they cannot put it back,\" one of the top 30 shareholders in BAE told Reuters. Armored vehicles used in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as warships and fighter jets for Europe have fuelled BAE\\'s growth and profits. It has extended its reach with deals in Saudi Arabia and Australia. But Europe\\'s arms purchases are drying up and U.S. and British troops in Afghanistan are heading home, meaning the outlook for BAE, formed in 1999 with the merger of Marconi Electric Systems and British Aerospace, is dimming. \"BAE shareholders, they need to ask management where they go from here because clearly in agreeing to do this merger there was an implicit admission that maybe their focus on defense was perhaps a failed strategy,\" Societe Generale analyst Zafar Khan told Reuters. Troops in Afghanistan will go home in 2014 when BAE\\'s last Type 45 destroyer for the Royal Navy is also due to set sail. SAUDI LIFELINE Weak prospects for a \"big win\" to offset slowdowns in such programs are worries for both the company and investors, and analysts agree a upgrading a contract on Typhoon fighter jets for Saudi Arabia must now be at the top of BAE\\'s to-do list. \"BAE really needs the cash from renegotiating Typhoon pricing with Saudi Arabia. Without it total gearing remains high to 2015 (and) we see a decreased possibility of share buybacks,\" said analyst Sash Tusa at Echelon Research and Advisory. The deal is worth more than 7 billion pounds and analysts estimate as much as 600 million pounds in cash this year. Without it, dividends that have grown by 10 percent a year could be in trouble in the near future. Even with it, growth hopes are modest. CEO King highlighted the program, and a campaign to sell warplanes to Oman, on a call with reporters on Wednesday. \"We have real key prospects in Saudi, in Oman and in other territories,\" King said, while Chairman Dick Olver said current dividend plans remain unchanged. But beyond 2012 some see trouble. Bank of America analysts on Thursday cut estimates on BAE\\'s stock price and the dividends it is likely to deliver in 2013 and 2014. SWINGEING CUTS BAE\\'s push into the United States has been the most successful of any European defense firm. Few analysts question setting up shop in a market four times the size of Britain, Germany and France combined. But that exposure now leaves BAE vulnerable, as the Pentagon lines up $487 billion in spending cuts over the next decade. Worse, there is a major risk of the figure doubling unless Washington swiftly gets its finances in order. \"BAE are left in a tricky position, closely linked to defense spending with U.S. budget cuts likely and the threat of (further cuts under U.S. budgetary) sequestration looming,\" said a second BAE shareholder. \"Consolidation would seem sensible in the face of such difficulties, but as we have seen, this is not going to be easy to achieve,\" he said of the EADS escapade. Wednesday\\'s collapse of the mooted EADS-BAE merger was blamed on the German, French and UK governments failing to agree terms. BAE shareholders speaking to Reuters on Thursday were willing to give management time to recover from the affair, but analysts did not discount the possibility of shareholders looking for value through a break-up. Most said BAE getting taken over in its entirety was unlikely given its size and tough competition rules in the United States where its most likely suitors operate. But some saw a chance of a buyer looking at parts of the business. \"We see a greater likelihood in one of the U.S. groups making an offer for (U.S.-based unit) BAE Inc,\" said Societe Generale\\'s Khan. \"We believe that BAE should explore all options to maximize value for shareholders, including the disposal of the U.S. business.\" Management\\'s more mundane challenges also linger, including BAE\\'s retirement funding shortfall and rising net debt pile. Net debt of 1.44 billion pounds in 2011 was six times the figure from the year before, while the funding gap jumped by more than 1 billion pounds. Better cash inflow could come this year, management promised in an interim statement on Thursday, but linked this to securing the Saudi deal. Modest growth in 2012 underlying earnings per share would also hinge on that deal getting done.

      "{'text': ' The European Union accused the United States on Thursday of ignoring a World Trade Organisation ruling to stop subsidies to planemaker Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and asked the Geneva-based body to investigate, prolonging the world\\'s largest trade dispute. \\n The United States said last month it had complied with an order to withdraw subsidies to Boeing after the WTO found in March that the U.S. aircraft manufacturer had received billions of dollars in unfair aid. But the European Commission, the EU\\'s executive, said Washington has shown no proof it has complied. \"It is now clear for the European Union that the United States has not only failed to properly implement the decision of the WTO but it has even provided new subsidies to Boeing,\" the Commission said in a statement. The Commission said U.S. subsidies were costing European aerospace companies billions of euros in lost revenue and that recent U.S.-EU talks had failed to resolve the dispute. \"The U.S. claimed to have removed (the subsidies), but provided no detailed evidence to support its claims,\" it said. Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative\\'s office, said the United States remained \"confident that the actions we announced on Sept 23rd brought us into full compliance with our WTO obligations.\" The EU\\'s request for a panel to review the U.S. compliance effort seems to ignore U.S. programs \"that we made clear have been terminated,\" she said. The WTO has also ruled against European support to Airbus in a case brought by the United States. Washington accuses the EU of not complying with that ruling. Airbus is owned by EADS ( EAD.PA ), in which the French government has a stake and the German government has influence via a holding owned by Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ). \"Instead of bringing into compliance the massive illegal subsidies that Boeing has received in the past and continues to receive from U.S. federal and state governments ... Boeing has neither paid back nor eliminated the illegal subsidies,\" said a spokeswoman for Airbus. Washington is threatening up to $10 billion in sanctions in the dispute, while Brussels is threatening $12 billion. However, most observers expect both sides to eventually negotiate a settlement to end the dispute.

      "{'text': ' Fund companies are growing more wary of introducing new exchange-traded funds, and more willing to kill those that have not caught on, as they grapple with a price war in an overcrowded $1.2 trillion market dominated by the three largest providers. \\n BlackRock Inc.( BLK.N ), State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard Group offer ETFs in virtually every major asset class. Together, the Big Three have captured 77.6 percent of all new investor money that has come this year into the U.S. ETF market this year, up from 60.5 percent in 2011, according to Lipper. In recent weeks, Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ) slashed its ETF fees and BlackRock said it planned to. This all makes it more difficult for new entrants to successfully compete. That has cut the net increase in ETFs in the first nine months of this year to just 60, down almost 69 percent from 192 in the same period last year, according to IndexUniverse LLC. While there were 146 new ETFs launched, down 34 percent from 222 in the year-earlier period, there was also a huge spike in ETF closures to 86, almost triple the 30 for all of 2011. With more than 1,450 ETFs available in the United States, firms realize there are very few opportunities to find a niche that is not already covered, said Tim Strauts, ETF analyst at Morningstar Inc ( MORN.O ). Some firms are also exiting the business entirely. In just the past few months, Scottrade and Russell Investments announced the shut-down of their ETF businesses and Direxion Shares and Global X said they were closing a number of ETFs after they failed to garner assets. Those who are launching new ETFs are adding new methodologies to offer twists on already popular ideas, Strauts said. To compete with the largest ETF providers, firms must find better ways to structure exposure to various sectors, said Bruno del Ama, chief executive officer of Global X Funds, which has 31 ETFs with $1.5 billion in assets. \"It\\'s not necessarily cheaper exposure, or new exposure, but smarter exposure,\" del Ama said. Most industry analysts expect the pace of new ETF creation will slow even further as firms increasingly realize how difficult it is to be successful in this market. Dave Nadig, director of research at IndexUniverse, estimates in the coming years, the standard number of new ETFs coming to market will be between 80 and 100 a year. There were 222 launches in 2011. \"The pace of growth ... and the pace of closures will slow as firms stop trying these niche products that fail and need to be closed 18 months later,\" Nadig said. SQUEEZING MARGINS, NEW TWISTS Any firm looking to launch a new ETF must first contend with the Big Three both on breadth and price. Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, early entrants into ETFs, have established themselves over the past decade or more. These firms together hold $943.17 billion in ETF assets, or 73 percent of the U.S. total, according to Lipper, a share of flows they have maintained despite increasing competition over the years. Vanguard, long the low-cost leader, has gained market share over the last several years, though it is now facing more price competition. Schwab, for instance, slashed some of its fees to pennies. The environment makes it tough for smaller players trying to get a better foothold in the business. Copycat ETFs often fail to attract investors away from established funds, said Paul Baiocchi, an ETF analyst at IndexUniverse. He added that niche strategies have trouble attracting investors and may also have liquidity issues. Fewer niche ETFs are being launched, although some still raise eyebrows. For example, on September 28, a newcomer to ETFs, LocalShares, filed to introduce the \"Nashville ETF,\" which would invest only in Nashville, Tennessee-based companies. Some ETFs of that nature - including one for Oklahoma and another for Texas launched in 2009 - were closed within a year after failing to attract investors. In some cases, firms are being more creative by taking popular asset classes, like junk bonds or commodities, and packaging them differently - often using customized indexes. For example Van Eck\\'s Market Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond ETF ( ANGL.P ), which started trading in April, tracks an index of bonds that were issued as investment grade, but have since been downgraded. The $10.6 million ETF - tiny by comparison to more-liquid ETFs - is yielding 6 percent so far this year. Van Eck has practically made its business case around the idea of taking existing asset classes and creating new indices, said Ed Lopez, its director of marketing. \"There are a lot of ideas that would help improve products that are already out there,\" Lopez said. Existing ETFs track specific indexes, making it hard to change the way they invest. \"Traditional bond indexes put the most money into the most indebted company or country,\" Nadig said. \"You are starting to see indexes with weightings based on something other than the issuer.\" Similarly, firms are launching commodity ETFs that address problems that have haunted these products. Many commodity ETFs that track futures have suffered from \"contango,\" where future prices are higher than the current spot price, causing the ETFs to perform differently than their underlying commodities. But recently, more providers have introduced commodity ETFs tracking indices that do not roll into the front month\\'s future contracts, but are instead more tactical. For instance, BNP Paribas Stream S&P Dynamic Roll Global Commodities Fund BNPC.P, which started trading in June, can participate in contracts further out on the futures curve, mitigating the potential for contango. The $17 million ETF has returned 11.84 percent for the past three months, compared to its benchmark, the Morningstar Long-Only Commodity TR Index, which has returned 7.95 percent for the same period. The danger of some of these products, however, is that they may not trade often and thus trade at a premium or a discount to their underlying securities. And some of these new ETFs may be too complicated, scaring away already-wary investors. \"Some of these products may be too sophisticated for their own good,\" Morningstar\\'s Strauts said. \"It may be tough for them to get traction with investors.\" (Additional reporting by  Ryan Vlastelica ; Editing by Jennifer Merritt and  David Gregorio )', 'date': ' Thu Oct 11, 2012 3:42pm EDT\\n', 'title': ' Analysis: Fund firms cut back on new ETFs, closing more\\n', 'author': ' By Jessica Toonkel\\n', 'link': ' http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-etflaunches-niche-idUSBRE89A1G820121011\\n\\n \\n\\n NEW YORK  ('}\n"

      "{'text': ' Europe\\'s two biggest aerospace firms will go back to the drawing board to find new strategies after Germany stymied the world\\'s biggest arms and aviation company merger. \\n Britain\\'s BAE Systems, which earns nearly half its revenue selling arms to the Pentagon, could end up a takeover target after failing to seal its $45 billion deal with the Franco-German maker of Airbus civilian jets, EADS. Politically, the deal\\'s failure may hurt British Prime Minister David Cameron, who failed to persuade Germany\\'s Angela Merkel to allow the merger and now faces uncertainty over the future of his country\\'s most important engineering firm. EADS shareholders mainly expressed relief at the collapse of the deal, fearing for their investment in a successful civilian planemaker as it ventured into a declining defence market. EADS shares ( EAD.PA ) rose 5.29 percent on Wednesday, while BAE shares ( BAES.L ) fell 1.38 percent. The merger\\'s failure is however a setback for EADS boss Tom Enders, who had hoped the merger would dilute the political control that Berlin and Paris exert over his firm. Britain and France both backed the planned merger, but Germany never warmed to it, despite the companies saying they were prepared to pledge to keep jobs there, allow Berlin to hold a big stake and meet other conditions. \"We started asking ourselves, \\'Does this deal really make sense?\\'\" one senior German official said. \"The market went down, investors were against it, the synergies were unclear, as was U.S. market access with the big state shareholdings.\" BAE, a private company which enjoys privileged access to Pentagon contracts, would have needed Germany and France to limit their control of the combined firm to avoid alienating Washington which does not want foreign states exerting influence over its defence contractors. \"We had clear red lines that we were not willing to go beyond, relative to engagement and involvement of governments,\" BAE\\'s CEO Ian King said. \"If that was going to impinge on our ability to commercially run this new merged organization, and support and develop our existing business, then we wouldn\\'t go to that point, and that is where we are today.\" NEGOTIATIONS Ultimately, German officials said, the parties were unable to resolve the shareholding issue to everyone\\'s satisfaction. Paris wanted to retain the option of going up to 13.5 percent by buying a stake held by French firm Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) at a later date. German officials insisted they be able to follow suit. The British wanted a cap of 10 percent each, concerned that the Germans and French could approach a blocking minority if they went above that level. Still, the companies believed they could have bridged the differences if Germany was more willing to negotiate. \"France and the UK agreed that Germany have the same stakeholding as France in the merged group. Separately, vast guarantees were given regarding safeguarding national security interests, sites, jobs. The topic of headquarters was being discussed very emotionally, but not an issue big enough to let the deal fail,\" a source close to the transaction said. The merger would have created a group employing nearly a quarter of a million people that could better compete with U.S. rival Boeing ( BA.N ). Asked whether BAE management felt under pressure as a result of the stormy investor reaction followed by the collapse of the plans, King said: \"Certainly not. No more than usual\". Britain backed the deal and has largely supported BAE\\'s case that French and German influence would have to be limited to make the deal work, especially given BAE\\'s vast U.S. business. \"Our view is that for this company as a merged entity to have been successful, it would have needed to be able to operate as a commercial company free of undue control or influence by any single government and that\\'s something that the company evidently has decided it is not able to achieve,\" British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said. The merger never won over either company\\'s shareholders. Barry Norris, founding partner at Argonaut Capital Partners, an EADS shareholder, said: \"Today\\'s decision to terminate the merger talks is a triumph for common sense and shareholder value. Having sunk almost 30 billion euros ($38.70 billion) into new Airbus plane projects, which are only now beginning to break even, it made no sense for EADS to now share this with BAE shareholders. \"Continuing merger negotiations would have resulted in a long battle with shareholders and sustained tension over weak corporate governance. That the problems in executing the deal proved too complex should be a source of celebration rather than regret,\" he said. But without the deal, BAE remains exposed to severe cuts in U.S. defence spending as troops finish their withdrawal from Afghanistan. Among its many U.S. contracts, the British firm is the largest supplier of armored vehicles for the U.S. military. Chairman Dick Olver said the firm would return to business as normal, despite what he acknowledged was a tough climate. \"We have an excellent Plan A, which is driving the company, admittedly in a difficult business environment, and the executives are doing an excellent job,\" he told reporters on a conference call alongside CEO King.

      "{'text': ' Four Nigerian villagers took Royal Dutch Shell to court on Thursday in a landmark pollution case that campaigners said could open the door to more compensation claims against international companies. \\n The fishermen and farmers, together with the Friends of the Earth campaign group, accuse the oil major of polluting land and waterways around their homes in the Niger Delta region of Africa\\'s top energy producer. Shell has denied responsibility, saying the leaks were caused by sabotage. The villagers launched their claim in a civil court in The Hague, where Shell has its joint global headquarters. It was the first time a Dutch-registered company had been sued in a Dutch court for offences allegedly carried out by a foreign subsidiary. Friends of the Earth said the claim, if successful, could open up a new way for plaintiffs to take on multinationals - by suing their parent companies in their home countries. The villagers, who appeared in court, want unspecified damages saying Shell and other corporations were responsible for pollution from three oil spills between 2004 and 2007. \"My community is a ghost land as a result of the devastation. We had good vegetation. Today people have respiratory problems and are getting sick,\" said one of the plaintiffs Eric Dooh, from the Goi community, which lives between two pipelines. \"Shell is aware of the whole devastation. I want them to pay compensation, to clean up the pollution so we can grow our crops and fish again,\" the 44-year-old told Reuters before the hearing. Shell says the pollution was caused by thieves breaking into pipelines to steal the oil, and believes it has played its part in cleaning it up. \"The matter has been resolved as far as we are concerned and we do not properly understand why Friends of the Earth has submitted the case,\" Allard Castelein, Shell\\'s vice president for environment, told Reuters before the hearing. The biggest pollution problem in the Niger Delta was caused by thieves who steal oil from Shell\\'s installations, he said. Around 150,000 barrels of oil are stolen every day in the Delta. That is worth about $6 billion a year. Friends of the Earth said other companies could face similar claims in European Union cities if it won the case. \"It opens up a range of possibilities for people from poor countries to use the legal system to seek compensation from companies,\" said Geert Ritsema, international affairs coordinator at the environmental group during a break in the proceedings. WETLAND ECOSYSTEM The Nigerians\\' lawyer Channa Samkalden told the court Shell had failed to maintain pipelines, clean up leaks and prevent pollution. \"It was insufficient maintenance, not sabotage, that was responsible for the leaks ... Shell did not operate as a conscientious oil company,\" she said. With around 31 million inhabitants, the Niger Delta is one of the world\\'s most important wetland and coastal marine ecosystems. It is an important source of food for the poor, rural population. Last year, the United Nations said in a report the government and multinational oil companies, particularly Shell, were responsible for 50 years of oil pollution that had devastated the Ogoniland region, part of the Niger Delta. The government and oil firms have pledged to clean up the region and other parts of the Delta, but residents say they have seen little action. Shell Petroleum Development Co (SPDC) is the largest oil and gas company in Nigeria, with production capacity of more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. It operates a joint venture in which state owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp has a majority share. Total SA subsidiary Elf Petroleum Nigeria Ltd. also has a stake. Three judges are expected to deliver their verdict on the Hague case in the new year.

Michael Frieser and Marc Tempelman have been appointed co-heads of financial institutions corporate and investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). \"With this leadership team we are looking to significantly build our market share in this sector,\" Christian Meissner, the global head of corporate and investment banking, and Bob Elfring, one of Meissner\\'s European deputies, said in the memo. Bank of America\\'s investment bank has been hit by a series departures and undergone a series of reshuffles this year, with Meissner only moving into the top corporate and investment banking job in January. The division is in charge of overseeing advisory activity on merger and acquisition deals and stock and debt underwriting. Earlier this week, BofA ML named capital markets specialist Rupert Hume-Kendall as chairman of corporate and investment banking in EMEA to bolster its coverage of key clients. BofA ML\\'s financial institutions franchise in particular was hit after star dealmaker Andrea Orcel left for UBS ( UBSN.VX ) in March. Orcel counts banks such as Spain\\'s Santander ( SAN.MC ) among his biggest clients, and BofA ML had scored a lead role underwriting a bumper rights issue for Italy\\'s UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) before his departure. Baldock, who has been at BofA ML for 12 years, has worked on some big bank deals alongside Orcel, including the ultimately ill-fated acquisition of ABN Amro by RBS ( RBS.L ), and is also known as an insurance specialist. In her new position as chair, Baldock will assume a more ambassadorial role rather than a hands-on management job, liaising with key clients and trying to win new business. The financial institutions industry has remained a big focus area for investment banks even as they cut back in other areas as the flow of deals slows. In the first nine months of the years, global investment banking fees in the financials sector were just over $15 billion, while income from deals in the energy and power industry for instance brought in $8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

      "{'text': ' JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon on Wednesday lashed out at the government for a lawsuit alleging misdeeds at Bear Stearns, more than four years after JPMorgan was asked to rescue the teetering financial giant. \\n Dimon said the company is still paying the price for doing the Federal Reserve \"a favor\" by buying Bear Stearns in early 2008. \"I\\'m going to say we\\'ve lost $5 billion to $10 billion on various things related to Bear Stearns now. And yes, I put it in the unfair category,\" Dimon said, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington. Dimon\\'s candid comments come one week after the New York State Attorney General filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan, alleging that Bear Stearns deceived investors buying mortgage-backed securities in 2006 and 2007. During a wide-ranging hour-long discussion that went from the \"fiscal cliff\" to the impact of regulations, Dimon bristled when a member of the audience asked him if he now regretted participating with the government to rescue Bear Stearns in light of the lawsuit. \"We didn\\'t participate with the Federal Reserve, OK?\" he said. \"Let\\'s get this one exactly right. We were asked to do it. We did it at great risk to ourselves ... Would I have done Bear Stearns again knowing what I know today? It\\'s real close.\" The federal government engineered the rescue during the Bush administration when regulators were desperate to find a buyer who could take on Bear Stearns\\' toxic assets and help calm markets. Dimon went on to recount how he warned a senior regulator at the time of the deal to \"please take into consideration when you want to come after us down the road for something that Bear Stearns did, that JPMorgan was asked to do this by the federal government.\" He added that JPMorgan, which will report its third-quarter earnings on Friday, will come out fine in the end. But if he is ever put in a similar position again, he said he \"wouldn\\'t do it.\" \"I\\'m a big boy. I\\'ll survive,\" he said. \"But I think the government should think twice before they punish business every single time things go wrong.\" \"FISCAL CLIFF WAR ROOM\" Beyond Bear Stearns, Dimon also criticized the government for so far failing to seriously negotiate an agreement to avoid a fiscal cliff of $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts due to hit at the end of the year. He said JPMorgan is \"forming a fiscal cliff war room\" and will be prepared. \"JP Morgan will survive a fiscal cliff - it is just terrible policy to allow it to get close,\" he said. He backed several proposals supported by Democrats to raise revenues, including a higher individual tax rate for the wealthy and a hike in the capital gains tax to 20 percent while keeping corporate taxes low. \"I don\\'t mind paying 39.6 percent in taxes,\" he said. Dimon is one of a handful of CEOs who have been lobbying lawmakers to give businesses greater certainty around budget and taxes issues before the year\\'s end. Republicans want to extend low rates that expire on December 31 for all income groups, while President Barack Obama and Democrats want to extend the lower rates only for households earning up to $250,000. These are the expiring tax rates first enacted by President George W. Bush. The current top rates are 33 percent and 35 percent. They would rise to 36 and 39.6 percent under the Democrats\\' proposal. While a decision on the individual tax rates must be made before the end of the year, the corporate tax issue is almost certainly going to wait until next year at the earliest. Obama and his Republican presidential rival Mitt Romney agree that the current 35 percent corporate tax rate should be reduced to be more competitive globally, but they disagree on the extent and how to fund such a rate cut. Despite backing some of Obama\\'s tax plans, Dimon told the audience he is \"barely\" still a Democrat. \\'INTENSELY STUPID\\' During Wednesday\\'s event, Dimon was also faced with questions about the \"London whale\" credit derivative trades that have so far racked up at least $5.8 billion in losses for the bank. While Dimon has previously acknowledged his bank\\'s failure to intervene sooner, he went even further on Wednesday in assigning himself personal responsibility for not detecting the problematic hedging strategy. \"I should have caught it ... I didn\\'t.\" He said the trading loss was \"really intensely stupid\" and \"it\\'s kind of embarrassing personally.\" Dimon also touched on financial reforms more generally, saying he was frustrated with contradictory and overlapping regulations being pushed out by policymakers. He said JPMorgan could see more than $1 billion in annual overhead costs from new international and domestic financial regulations, including the Basel III capital standards. (Reporting by Sarah N.

      "{'text': ' The automotive industry faces a tougher year in 2012 than it has done this year, Audi ( NSUG.DE ) Chief Executive Rupert Stadler told Reuters in an interview for release on Sunday. \\n \"But this should not be a reason to fall into pessimism,\" he said, adding that the automotive industry will continue to grow over the next 10 years thanks to the enormous appetite for mobility among people in developing economies. Stadler also denied speculation in the German media that he might be a successor for Audi parent Volkswagen\\'s ( VOWG_p.DE ) CEO, Martin Winterkorn, when he steps down at the end of 2016. He said he expects China\\'s automotive market to grow 8 to 9 percent, with its premium segment expanding 20 percent or even 30 percent, though he did not give a timeframe. Audi is the market leader in the luxury segment in China, well ahead of German rivals BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and Daimler AG\\'s ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes. Stadler, who has set a goal of making Audi the world\\'s top premium car maker by 2015, told Reuters carmakers have a better chance of growing in the premium segment because emerging markets like China will produce a crop of millionaires in dollar terms. Audi is aiming for the top position in the United States, which has the world\\'s biggest premium segment at nearly 2 million cars, he said. The company currently runs behind both BMW and Mercedes in that market. He said a new production plant there would help, but it was still unclear where the facility would be based. He noted that wages in Mexico were cheaper than in the United States, where parent Volkswagen already has a factory. But he said if Audi were to join the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, \"the investments would certainly be somewhat less,\" although exporting cars out of the United States would have high customs fees. NO VW PLANS Asked if he would like to be the successor to VW\\'s Winterkorn, Stadler replied: \"No,\" adding he wanted to remain at Audi. \"I have many things to do here,\" he said. Like Ferdinand Piech, the current supervisory board chairman of Volkswagen, Winterkorn was Audi Chief Executive before becoming head of the executive board of Europe\\'s biggest carmaker. Stadler has been Audi CEO since 2007 and last year became a Volkswagen board member. Unlike Piech and Winterkorn, who both studied to become engineers, Stadler graduated with a business management degree. Volkswagen works council head Bernd Osterloh told a German newspaper the company could miss its internal outlook for vehicle sales in 2012, without saying how much growth the company expects. \"The reason would be weakness in southern European markets,\" he told Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview published on Saturday. \"But in exchange, we have good chances of selling more cars than before in Latin America, North America and Russia,\" he said.

      "{'text': ' Retailers saw a steady flow of last-minute shoppers on Saturday, the day before Christmas, putting a moderate cap on a pre-holiday season that started with a bang and has since waned. \\n Industry watchers are forecasting a stronger holiday shopping season than expected, fueled by deep discounts at the start of the season, unusually warm and dry weather, a late Hanukkah, and an extra shopping day. On the last shopping day before Christmas, the scene at several malls in different parts of the country was busy, but neither shoppers nor retailers seemed overwhelmed. \"The last-minute Charlies have come out,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group. \"Stores are busy, but not bustling.\" The fact that Christmas Eve falls on a Saturday is good for retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Best Buy and Gap Inc. So is the fact that the day after Christmas is a Monday, instead of a Sunday like last year, when many people stayed home and watched American football, said Ramesh Swamy, an analyst in Deloitte\\'s retail practice. \"The calendar is working in our favor,\" Swamy said. So is the fact that there was no blizzard this year, like there was last year. Many stores around the country saw brisk traffic in the past week, and Friday was the busiest shopping day of the season, according to a survey of stores done by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc. Sales at surveyed stores were trending up at a mid-single-digit rate for the week, on average, Taubman said, though luxury goods stores were trending up at high-single to double-digit rates. Saturday caps a key week in the retail calendar that saw a handful of major U.S. store chains staying open around the clock to cater to consumers\\' late-night shopping craves, from Toys R Us Inc to Macy\\'s Inc, a decision hailed by shoppers and industry watchers alike. The National Retail Federation raised its forecast for holiday retail sales to a 3.8 percent increase from an October forecast of a 2.8 percent increase. And ShopperTrak, which monitors traffic at shopping malls, now expects sales in November and December to rise 3.7 percent, up from its September forecast of 3 percent. NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT The Thanksgiving weekend, which marks the unofficial start to holiday shopping, saw sales soar 16.4 percent to $52.4 billion this year, the NRF said. The number of transactions at merchants jumped 17 percent on Black Friday alone, dwarfing the 5 percent gains seen in the prior two years, according to data from MasterCard Inc\\'s network. The binge was spurred by deep discounts, but they have since moderated, thanks to tighter inventory management by retailers who often would rather sell fewer items at full price than more items at profit-sapping markdowns. \"It isn\\'t how much you sell but how well you sell it,\" said NPD\\'s Cohen. \"Retailers would rather sell out than sell off.\" As a result, inventory on key gift items, such as sweaters, was quite low in many stores on Saturday, Cohen said, and the discounts were not that extreme. One shopper, who only wanted to be identified as 67-year-old Bill V., was finishing up his holiday shopping at a Las Vegas-area Macy\\'s store early Saturday morning. Armed with several bags filled with gifts for his wife, daughter and grandson, he said the deals were not much to write home about. \"They were OK. They could have been better,\" he said. Vickie Hoffman, a 39-year-old stay-at-home mom, bought some perfume and lotions at Victoria\\'s Secret and an engraved snow globe for some last-minute gifts on Saturday. \"I didn\\'t think so much of the sales this year,\" Hoffman said. \"I didn\\'t think there were many great deals. I just didn\\'t see them.\" Most of the steepest discounts on clothing on Saturday were for cold-weather coats, due to the mild weather this season. A Macy\\'s in suburban Las Vegas was offering 50 percent to 60 percent off women\\'s winter coats, 60 percent off sweaters, 50 percent off slippers and fuzzy socks and 40 percent to 70 percent off purses. Children\\'s clothing chain Gymboree was selling all its merchandise, in stores and online, for $15.99 or less. Guess Inc had 50 percent off sweaters, outerwear and boots and teen clothing chain Aeropostale Inc had women\\'s fleeces, originally $49.50, on sale for $18 and men\\'s and women\\'s jeans, originally $54.50, on sale for $25. All retailers offer discounts to draw shoppers as part of their holiday strategy. But unplanned markdowns, as a result of poor sales, is what hurts profit margins. On balance, margins are expected to be better this year than last, Cohen said, but January will be the key. That is when shoppers head to stores with returns or gift cards, often spending 16 percent more than the value of their credit, he said. Some retailers\\' tactics included offering people store credit that they can use starting next week, as a way to get them back in the stores once the full-priced, spring merchandise hits shelves, Swamy said. The weak economy has put a damper on consumer confidence, but shoppers\\' resilience has surprised the industry. \"There are still a lot of issues out there, including uncertainty in the economy,\" Swamy said. \"But for whatever reason it didn\\'t dampen people\\'s holiday spirit.

      "{'text': ' Japan and China agreed to start formal talks early next year on a free trade pact that would also include South Korea, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Sunday after talks that showed the deepening bonds between Asia\\'s two biggest economies. \\n Japan also said it was looking to buy Chinese treasury debt, and the two governments agreed to enhance financial cooperation. \"On a free trade agreement among Japan, China and South Korea, we\\'ve made a substantial progress for an early start of negotiations,\" Noda told reporters after his meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao. China\\'s central bank, the People\\'s Bank of China, said on its website (www.pbc.gov.cn) that the two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral financial market cooperation and \"encourage the use of the renminbi and Japanese yen in international trade transactions between the two countries.\" The renminbi is another name for China\\'s yuan currency. The trade talks announcement builds on an agreement between the three countries last month also to seek a trilateral investment treaty and finish studies on the proposed free trade agreement by the end of December so that they could start formal negotiations on the trade pact. \"China is willing to closely coordinate with Japan to promote our two countries\\' monetary and financial development, and to accelerate progress of the China-Japan-Republic of Korea free-trade zone and East Asian financial cooperation,\" Wen told Noda at the meeting, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry\\'s official website (www.mfa.gov.cn). But the regional trade negotiations could also compete for attention with Washington\\'s push for a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), after Japan said last month it wants to join in the talks over the U.S. proposal. CLOSER ECONOMIC TIES Despite sometimes rancorous political ties between the two neighbors, Japan\\'s economic fortunes are increasingly tied to China\\'s economic growth and consumer demand. China and Japan are also the world\\'s first and second-biggest holders of foreign reserves. Wen told Noda that closer economic ties were in both countries\\' interests. \"The deep-seated consequences of the current international financial crisis continue to spread, and the complexity and severity of global and world developments have exceeded our expectations,\" Wen said. \"China and Japan both have the need and conditions to join hands more closely to respond to challenges and deepen mutually beneficial strategic relations.\" China has been Japan\\'s biggest trading partner since 2009. In 2010, trade between the two nations grew by 22.3 percent compared to levels in 2009, reaching 26.5 trillion yen ($339.3 billion), according to the Japan External Trade Organization. In a statement issued after the two leaders\\' meeting, the Japanese government said it would seek to buy Chinese government bonds -- a tentative step toward diversification of Tokyo\\'s large foreign exchange reserves that are believed to be mostly held in dollars. China central bank said the two governments agreed to support Japanese businesses issuing yuan bonds in Tokyo and other markets outside of China, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation would begin a pilot scheme for issuing yuan-denominated bonds in mainland China. The People\\'s Bank of China also said it will support Japan in using the yuan for direct investment in China. But Japanese officials have stressed that Japan\\'s trust in dollar assets remains unshaken, and the scale of the planned purchase of Chinese government bonds will be small. Wen and Noda also agreed to set up a framework to discuss maritime issues after diplomatic ties deteriorated sharply last year following Japan\\'s arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain near disputed isles in the East China Sea. Bilateral meetings attended by vice ministers and senior officials from relevant ministries will be held periodically to exchange views, in an effort to prevent a similar row from happening. \"On maritime matters, we have successfully set up a channel to solve problems through multi-layered dialogue,\" Noda told reporters.

      "{'text': ' Europe faces another year of dismal economic performance in 2012 that will weigh on global growth, but emerging markets and the United States should at least keep the world economy moving in the right direction. \\n There are several reasons why next year may be nothing to look forward to, according to Reuters polls from the last few months. Many of the world\\'s biggest developed economies are heading into recession, global stock markets look set to recoup only a fraction of their heavy losses in 2011, oil prices will head lower, and asset managers are unsure where best to invest. And these could be the best-case scenarios. Most economists base their assumptions on the hope that the euro zone\\'s sovereign debt crisis will not boil over into a new global economic crisis, having already dented growth in major exporters to Europe. Still, most of the major emerging market economies like Brazil and China should pick up speed later next year. All of them have suffered from slowing economies in recent months, caused mainly by tightening monetary policy in the face of high inflation. \"It\\'s important to stress the world economy is still growing. But it\\'s a tale of two worlds,\" said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank. \"The storyline for 2012 is that Europe drags the world down in the first half of the year, and China drags it up in the second half of the year.\" Enormous political risks cloud the outlook further, with elections and leadership changes in the most powerful countries and the prospect of continuing turmoil in the Middle East. Still, there are glimmers of hope. The United States\\' economy has performed better than most had hoped over the last quarter, and Reuters\\' polls of economists show it growing around 2.2 percent in 2012, compared with zero growth in the euro zone. \"The big unknown in Europe and the U.S. is that big companies, with balance sheets in good shape, have the ability to invest at home if they want. It\\'s more likely that will take place in the U.S. rather than Europe,\" said Lyons. THE EURO ZONE QUESTION European Union leaders took a historic step towards greater fiscal integration earlier in December, but economists have been clear that this would not ease a debt crisis entering its third year and still hogging the headlines in 2012. Reuters polls show real concern that leaders are doing far too little to stimulate growth, with the likes of Spain and Italy destined for long and painful recessions. The euro zone as a whole, meanwhile, is probably in a moderate recession right now that will last midway into 2012. \"The euro area continues to be a source of economic and financial instability for the rest of the world,\" said Juan Perez-Campanero, economist at Santander, in a research note. \"We could be facing a more permanent and lasting decline in growth capacity in developed economies and, particularly, the euro area.\" Whether Spain and Italy will need to seek funding from the euro zone\\'s bailout facility next year is open to question, with a very slim majority of economists polled this month - 27 out of 56 - saying not. And a November survey of 20 top economists and former policymakers in academia and respected research institutes showed 14 of them do not expect the euro zone to survive in its current form. Even in Japan, where economists have downgraded growth forecasts relentlessly, the economy is expected to pick up in the fiscal year from April and expand 1.8 percent. Japan should narrowly avoid a recession, but polls show little hope it will emerge from deflation any time soon. ASSESSING THE ASSETS The severe uncertainty surrounding 2012 is perhaps best reflected by Reuters\\' asset allocation poll of more than 50 leading investment houses in the United States, Europe and Japan. Investors raised their cash balance to the highest in a year in December as they prepared for a jittery 2012, although they also moved back into cheap equities, Reuters polls showed on Monday. The euro zone crisis was the key concern of asset managers polled, hence the increased preference for cash as well as moves into British and Asian shares rather than European ones. Similarly, the last quarterly stock markets poll suggested emerging markets will easily outperform European share indexes in 2012, which will struggle to bounce back to end-2010 levels, never mind end-2011. With Europe heading into a recession, oil prices look set to fall from here. Brent crude will average $105 a barrel next year, not far below this year\\'s record high average near $111. \"We expect a mild recession across the OECD next year to put a damper on demand and consequently prices,\" David Wech from Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy said. \"Nevertheless, the risk to oil prices is definitely on the upside given a still troubled geopolitical environment.\" Economic growth is likely to slow among the Gulf\\'s wealthy oil exporters next year, but governments will remain able to spend to counter the impact of any global slump, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. Respondents cited the euro zone debt crisis and signs of slowing growth in China as reasons for the darkened economic outlook in the Gulf. DELAYED CHINESE CHEERS Whatever the euro zone\\'s future, the effects of the debt crisis have already been felt across the world. The European Union is China\\'s biggest export market, and manufacturing data there show dwindling levels of foreign new orders. Indeed, the Chinese economy is now growing at its weakest pace since 2009. In an effort to support it the central bank cut reserve requirements at the end of last month for the first time in three years. Economists polled by Reuters after this move, however, said the People\\'s Bank of China will refrain from more aggressive stimulative policies unless growth falls sharply to below 8 percent. Similarly, India has been suffering from a pronounced slowdown in growth and Reuters polls suggest its central bank will also slacken monetary policy by mid-2012 to counter this, despite stubbornly high inflation. It could be in for a difficult year. \"Looking ahead, the economy faces the lagged effects of monetary tightening,\" said Leif Eskesen, economist HSBC in Singapore. \"Moreover, administrative hurdles and domestic policy paralysis are holding back investments and hurting sentiment.\" Brazil\\'s central bank on Thursday cut its 2011 growth estimate to 3.0 percent, versus its previous estimate of 3.5 percent, and said 2012 would see growth of 3.5 percent. Compared with previous years where growth averaged near double-digit rates, that would be a disappointment, although still a fair improvement on the anaemic rates of most developed peers. Overall, even the slightly depressed growth rates from these developing economic powers will power world growth next year. \"It is positive growth, but the picture does vary considerably - not just in terms of the first and second half of the year, but also depending on which part of the world you look at,\" concluded Lyons from Standard Chartered.

      "{'text': ' While the threat of credit rating downgrades hangs over Europe, a few big emerging market economies are on the upswing. \\n Indonesia provides arguably the starkest contrast. Fitch\\'s upgrade of Indonesia\\'s sovereign rating on December 15 restored it to investment grade status for the first time in 14 years. Back in 1997, when the Asian financial crisis exploded, the International Monetary Fund had to step in with a three-year loan worth $10.1 billion at the time. \"Indonesia\\'s banking sector was not prepared to withstand the financial turmoil that swept Southeast Asia,\" the IMF said then. Fast-forward to 2011, and it is European banks that are the focus of concern as the euro zone struggles to come up with a politically palatable way to solve its own debt crisis. All three of the world\\'s major ratings agencies have warned that European countries face downgrades if they cannot stem the crisis. Fitch said on December 16 that a comprehensive solution was \"technically and politically beyond reach.\" Sentiment toward Europe has turned so dark that the most positive thing Northern Trust economists could say about the outlook there was, \"Our base case is that the euro zone does not completely collapse within the next two years.\" Why the role reversal? Indonesia\\'s 2012 growth is expected to reach 6.4 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists, down only slightly from 2011\\'s estimated 6.5 percent. The euro zone is widely expected to be stuck in recession next year, while U.S. growth will probably trudge along at one-third of Indonesia\\'s pace. The lesson that Asia learned from its financial crisis in the late 1990s was, \"make sure you\\'ve got good insurance.\" Asia now holds most of the world\\'s foreign exchange reserves, with about $4.5 trillion concentrated in China and Japan combined. But there are also large stockpiles in India, Indonesia and South Korea. That cushion can provide protection from financial market turbulence. Indonesia, South Korea, India and others have tapped reserves this year to defend their currencies from extreme volatility. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ IMF on \"schizophrenic\" investors: imfdirect.imf.org/2011/12/21/2011-in-review-four-hard-truths/ For IFR\\'s forecasts for the week ahead in U.S. economic data, click on:  here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \"SCHIZOPHRENIC\" INVESTORS The IMF itself seems to have learned a few lessons from its experience in Asia, especially on how deep budget cuts can hurt a country\\'s economic growth and its citizens. Its November 1997 statement announcing Indonesia\\'s bailout arrangement spelled out the IMF\\'s policy prescription: tight fiscal and monetary policies and \"substantial\" fiscal measures to keep the budget in surplus. The IMF at the time expected Indonesia\\'s growth, which had been around 8 percent before the crisis, to slow to 5 percent in the first year of the program and 3 percent in the second. In fact, Indonesia\\'s economy contracted by 13.1 percent in 1998 and grew by only 0.8 percent in 1999. Former IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn acknowledged in February 2011 that the IMF\\'s reform program had been \"harmful and painful\" for the Indonesian people. Many economists worry that Europe\\'s austerity measures, much like those in Indonesia in the late 1990s, will end up doing even more damage to the economy, worsening the debt picture. IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard said investors were \"schizophrenic\" about austerity and growth. \"They react positively to news of fiscal consolidation, but then react negatively later, when consolidation leads to lower growth -- which it often does,\" Blanchard said. WHO IS NEXT? European countries are the obvious candidates for imminent downgrade. S&P\\'s move could come any day. Moody\\'s said on December 12 it will revisit its European ratings in the first quarter of 2012. While downgrades and the threat of more have received the most media attention this year, Fitch said its sovereign rating actions year-to-date were almost evenly split between upgrades and downgrades. Since August 5, when Standard & Poor\\'s stripped the United States of its AAA-rating, countries including Indonesia, Brazil, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Paraguay, Peru, Kazakhstan and Israel have received upgrades from at least one of the world\\'s big three ratings agencies. Next on the upgrade list may be the Philippines. Its leaders expressed some disappointment that Indonesia got the nod from Fitch first, although S&P revised its outlook to \"positive\" on December 16. But it is the negative actions that pose the global economic threat. The advanced economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have 2012 borrowing needs estimated at $10.5 trillion. A number this large means even a small increase in borrowing costs is meaningful. \"OECD debt managers are facing unprecedented funding challenges in meeting higher-than-anticipated, strong borrowing needs,\" the OECD said in a report on sovereign debt.

      "{'text': ' The Obama administration cleared the way for states to legalize Internet poker and certain other online betting in a switch that may help them reap billions in tax revenue and spur web-based gambling. \\n A Justice Department opinion dated September and made public on Friday reversed decades of previous policy that included civil and criminal charges against operators of some of the most popular online poker sites. Until now, the department held that online gambling in all forms was illegal under the Wire Act of 1961, which bars wagers via telecommunications that cross state lines or international borders. The new interpretation, by the department\\'s Office of Legal Counsel, said the Wire Act applies only to bets on a \"sporting event or contest,\" not to a state\\'s use of the Internet to sell lottery tickets to adults within its borders or abroad. \"The United States Department of Justice has given the online gaming community a big, big present,\" said I. Nelson Rose, a gaming law expert at Whittier Law School who consults for governments and the industry. The question at issue was whether proposals by Illinois and New York to use the Internet and out-of-state transaction processors to sell lottery tickets to in-state adults violated the Wire Act. But the department\\'s conclusion would eliminate \"almost every federal anti-gambling law that could apply to gaming that is legal under state laws,\" Rose wrote on his blog at www.gamblingandthelaw.com. If a state legalized intra-state games such as poker, as Nevada and the District of Columbia have done, \"there is simply no federal law that could apply\" against their operators, he said. The department\\'s opinion, written by Assistant Attorney General Virginia Seitz, said the law\\'s legislative history showed that Congress\\'s overriding goal had been to halt wire communications for sports gambling, notably off-track betting on horse races. Congress also had been concerned about rapid transmission of betting information on baseball, basketball, football and boxing among other sports-related events or contests, she summarized the legislative history as showing. \"The ordinary meaning of the phrase \\'sporting event or contest\\' does not encompass lotteries,\" Seitz wrote. \"Accordingly, we conclude that the proposed lotteries are not within the prohibitions of the Wire Act.\" The department expressed no opinion about a provision in the law that lets prosecutors shut down phone lines where interstate or foreign gambling is taking place. Many of the 50 U.S. states may be interested in creating online lotteries to boost tax revenues and help offset the ripple effect of a federal deficit-reduction push. The global online gambling industry grew 12 percent last year to as much as $30 billion, according to a survey in March by Global Betting and Gaming Consultancy, based on the Isle of Man, where online gambling is legal. Federal prosecutors in April charged three of the biggest Internet poker companies with fraud and money-laundering along with violations of another federal law, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Act of 1986. The government outlined an alleged scheme by owners of the three largest online poker companies - Full Tilt Poker, Absolute Poker and PokerStars - to funnel gambling profits to online shell companies that would appear legitimate to banks processing payments.

      "{'text': ' The head of the International Monetary Fund said the world economy was in danger and urged Europeans to speak with one voice on a debt crisis that has rattled the global financial system. \\n In Nigeria last week, IMF Christine Lagarde said the IMF\\'s 4 percent growth forecast for the world economy in 2012 could be revised downward, but gave no new figure. \"The world economy is in a dangerous situation,\" she told France\\'s Journal du Dimanche in an interview published on Sunday. The debt crisis, which continues into 2012 after a European Union summit on December 9 only temporarily calmed markets, \"is a crisis of confidence in public debt and in the solidity of the financial system,\" she said. European leaders drafted a new treaty for deeper economic integration in the euro zone, but it is not certain that the accord will stem the debt crisis, which began in Greece in 2009, and now threatens France and even economic powerhouse Germany. \"The December 9 summit wasn\\'t detailed enough on financial terms and too complicated on fundamental principles,\" said Lagarde. \"It would be useful for Europeans to speak with a single voice and announce a simple and detailed timetable,\" she said. \"Investors are waiting for it. Grand principles don\\'t impress.\" Part of the problem, she said, has been national calls for protectionism, making it \"difficult to put in place international coalition strategies against it.\" Lagarde added: \"National parliaments grumble at using public money or the guarantee of their state to support other countries. Protectionism is in the debate, and everyone for themselves is winning ground.\" She did not specify which countries she was referring to. Emerging countries, which had been growth engines for the world economy before the crisis, have also been affected, said Lagarde, citing China, Brazil and Russia. \"These countries, which were the engines, will suffer from instability factors,\" she told the newspaper.
